					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] November 25th, 2014   My book review of poet Steve Scafidi&#8217;s book To the Bramble and the Briar is posted at Civil War Monitor: LINK   I hope the review will draw new readers to this beautiful work, especially among people who normally aren&#8217;t interested in poetry. If you&#8217;re into 19th century America and / or Civil War, I think you&#8217;ll be intrigued by these interpretations — new and yet deeply authentic to the time and place.  Some of the poems were previously published as the Lincoln Poems in blackbird and Shenandoah. [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This story was thoughtful and complex. I especially enjoyed the segments traveling from different time periods, snapshots of Will&#039;s life and experiences as well as his joys and tribulations. Regina is described as almost so perfect it is frustrating, like she needs to just let it all go and take off on an impulse. The juxtaposition between her beliefs and desires and the tension holding Will back from pursuing his own hopes. The author has a clear and meaningful voice. I especially liked the metaphor in the opening of the story when Will is listening to the boys&#039; choir, how he felt as if he was being attacked. How could the harmonies of young voices make you feel attacked? Is it the guilt that these boys have been collected and improved, from their own complex and often painful histories. I appreciated that Will ultimately ended up following his intuition, buying a plane ticket for himself, despite the controversy he knew it would create with Regina. This story was well-written and impressively executed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A common trait that all of my favorite stories share is ambiguity. I like having something to chew on once I&#039;ve closed the book, or the tab. This is one of those stories. When I read his first incident, I tried to brush it off. I wanted to brush it off. &quot;Oh, it was just an episode of synesthesia.&quot; But it wasn&#039;t just anything. It was something else, and the more that became apparent to me, the deeper the story dragged me. I felt compelled toward it, just as Will is compelled toward Uganda. For me, it culminated with the startlingly clear image of  &quot;a sliding hue of dark blue, light blue, and grainy beige&quot; -- the ocean has its own ambiguity. This story will stay with me for a long time, I think.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A fascinating and delightfully ambiguous piece.  I appreciated that Fox set his story against the backdrop of American fundamentalism.  Though initially I wondered as to what this detail had to add to the overall narrative, I believe that Fox was making a comment about how right-wing fundamentalism, like the left-wing secularism that it often clashes with, tries to impose a pattern of rationality upon the world in spite of all the signs that the world is a fundamentally irrational place.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with Grace that it is the vivid descriptions and compelling details of Fox&#039;s story that draw the reader in first, and maintain this grasp voraciously until the end; a difficult feat to master. I grew up knowing some Christians who were home schooled and held similar views to the characters in the story. In my experience authors treatment of such outdated values are one-dimensional, so I appreciated the dynamic approach the author took with Regina, Will, and their families in this regard. Will believes a life of mundane certainty can bring him happiness,&quot;This, this. He wanted only this. With this he could be happy.&quot; But the possibility of this happiness does not solidify itself as a necessity. Are people searching for happiness alone, or is it a more complex condition of purpose and adventure that sustains satisfaction? Will chooses a dangerous, uncertain path rather than his simplistic vision of marital life with Regina. This choice is in keeping with what makes him a special character capable of defying the predictable: his ephemeral out of body experiences that draw him closer to the spiritual world. This makes Will unique, which is made clear by the authors description of the doctors who could not categorize his odd condition. Overall, the primary strength of this story is the way Fox travels through time, tying distant memories and recent occurrences together seamlessly. The woven collection of mismatched subject matter (refugee choirs, a home schooler’s dogma of strict chastity, young devoted love, a call to volunteer service abroad) are brought together harmoniously to make this piece really sing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The writer has a wonderful grasp of language, and he uses it to describe familiar details in unique and revelatory ways. I enjoyed how well the author conveys Will&#039;s branch of Christian culture in small details, not needing to go into lengthy exposition to convey a sense of the whole. I also value the sense of the author&#039;s invisibility. It feels like there&#039;s a direct connection between the reader and what Will thinks, what Will sees and experiences. In a similar way, the author never tells the reader what to think and how to feel; his writing creates impressions, but it&#039;s left for the reader to judge.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I truly enjoyed this story. Each paragraph was strategically used to used to add depth to the characters, furthering the plot tension. 
I loved how the story began, foreshadowing the ending, but allowing the reader to ignore the blatant hints in the meantime. Will looks to the Ugandan choir in an infallible, biblical sense and regards Regina as a seemingly shallow woman prioritizing social commitments above those in need. 
I love the description of the total body effect that the boys&#039; singing had on him and what little emotion he gave to his relationship with Regina. They seemed to reach both polarities of overwhelming emotion and none at all.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I loved the vivid descriptions and compelling details of this story. The author made me feel as if I was in Will&#039;s head and experiencing his internal dilemma firsthand. I enjoyed learning about Will&#039;s relationship with Regina through Will&#039;s portrayal of their experiences together and conversations between them. A lot was told about Regina through Will&#039;s flashbacks and internal musings. The clever. title immediately grasped my attention. It&#039;s a play on Will&#039;s dilemma to take a chance for the first time in his life, to leave behind the familiar and strong traditions of his community and to plunge into an exciting adventure.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like the division of character in this story. Will is two people: Regina&#039;s Will, who is reasonable, and pure, and whose simple desires are within reach any time he wants them; and the mystery Will, who appears without warnings, always alone, through these strange, unexplained, metaphysical moments. The story is on the surface about Will&#039;s decision to go to Uganda because he&#039;s a Christian and he wants to help people, but the layers below that are so much more complicated and unknowable. Will can&#039;t even articulate to himself why he wants to go. He knows it&#039;s not safe, and not good for his relationship with Regina, and any benefits the trip might offer are vague and never spelled out. But some otherworldly force makes his rationality meaningless. What exactly that force is, is the crux of the story. Less crucial to the deeper meaning of the story but absolutely necessary for the punch that it packs is the way the writer describes the sensory details of the experiences: he feels like he&#039;s been &quot;attacked,&quot; he feels &quot;pursued,&quot; it&#039;s the &quot;bubbling up of the vertigo, the uplift of a freefall.&quot; It terrifies him but it&#039;s a pleasurable terror.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[From the first to the last, your story drew haunting images with words.  The precise and beautiful prose very much reflects my acquaintance with Japanese aesthetics and restraint, which I found flowing from the narrator-protagonist.

					<description><![CDATA[Like Ms. Byer, I&#039;d never miss a Heaney book either!  Though my reasons are perhaps more complex: http://diannblakely.com/newupdate/uxorious.html.

While the titles above are all of interest, there&#039;s one to which I&#039;d especially like to point: *Copperhead*, by Rachel Richardson, my former student at the Sewanee Young Writers&#039; Conference.  In fact, I&#039;m glad to see this page still allows comments, for I&#039;ve three links and some information I&#039;d like to post: Rachel grew up in Berkeley but has--as will be obvious to anyone who reads her début collection, which I recommend wholeheartedly, a rarity for me--deep familial ties to both Louisiana and the Deep South&#039;s biracial culture.  I read *Copperhead* in manuscript and was impressed, in particular, by the &quot;Signage&quot; prose poems; Rachel has learned her lessons from Rich and C.D. Wright so well that by now, what their poems teach, she has thoroughly assimilated and made her own.  I&#039;m happy to offer three links and will hope for more readers of *Copperhead*, for that&#039;s my sole intent; Rachel, with Emma Bolden, remains among the three most talented students I&#039;ve ever been privileged to have in my classroom: http://swampland.com/articles/view/title:notes_on_the_state_of_poetry_part_three and http://blog.bestamericanpoetry.com/the_best_american_poetry/2011/06/the-new-black-by-diann-blakely.html and http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/243619567?auto_login_attempted=true

Never thrilled with technology.
Nothing like a book in the hand to hold and smell,

Imagine the kiss of air, and all the thought
that disappears... we are, of course, temporary -- 
and even quicker than before: because of today.

I wish there were a law that music (and it is unwelcome noise) were banned from ALL public places and instances, where you did not go there to specifically hear it being played/performed.  Being as irritable as cigar smoke and cess pools, if you don&#039;t want to smell  them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As someone picking up pen and paper again after a long departure, it heartens me that the literary world still has a place for the sharp and cutting edges of ambiguity wrought in the realms where faith and physical-spiritual experience are drawn and upset by smiths (and Foxes, apparently) who understand in three dimensions, the price of the curves they forge. 

This is clearly not just a prize-winning story, but a tale that should be included in the literary lexicon of future generations. There&#039;s not one line that doesn&#039;t bear a Truth worth looking at, pondering over. [Cuss word implying writers&#039; Hades deleted.] You sure set the bar, high, don&#039;t you?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These poems by William Keens, with their astonishing clarity and beauty, leave me speechless.  Maybe John Keats said it best, something that can be applied to William Keens and his poetry:

&quot;Beauty is truth, truth beauty,&quot; - that is all 
        Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am so delighted to hear of Bill and how he fared.  I am not surprized that his poetry is still wonderful.  It always was.  Bill was a classmate of mine at UNCG and indeed one of the most intense people I have ever known.  We had a long discussion one night at the Pickwick about what the moral thing to do with our lives would be.  Should we work outside the system to protest the hypocrasy and the control of the super rich, or inside the system to change it.  I was a baby reporter, so I voted for inside to change it. He didn&#039;t want to abandon his art. I was convinced that you could do both. Bill has shown that you still can.  I hate that he has Parkinson&#039;s. That is a cruel disease, but he still has the great gift he was given and hopefully will use it as much as possible to share as long as he can.  That&#039;s really all any of us get. I&#039;m thrilled to see his work again.

					<description><![CDATA[This review gives me a gateway of sorts into this collection&#039;s poetry, and from the excerpts quoted, I can understand Mr. Belcher&#039;s reservations.  I&#039;d say this is the sort of review I want, the sort that offers a detailed, intelligent assessment.  There are so many books of poetry out there, and I appreciate a reviewer taking the time to delve into a book&#039;s strengths and shortcomings.  I need to see portions of poems to form my own judgements; this review gives them in just the right number.  Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really appreciated the religious elements of this story, and I thought that the author did a wonderful job of tying all the religious points together at the end with the actual, audible &quot;calling&quot; that the main character experienced. The fact that it was just that, someone calling his name, and not the overdramatic display of bright lights and overt holiness, was what really struck me. It was by no means the burning of the biblical bush; yet it fit better into the story because it was something that could have happened in reality. After all, someone hearing their name being called is not supernatural. But in the context of this story, it carried great significance. 
One thing that I was slightly unclear about was the importance of chess in this story. Will points out that every move, at one point in the game, was accounted for and predictable. He knew how it would all play out, and so did his father (who the reader has come to dislike). And his father, realizing that he will lose, strikes the table in a fit of fury and injures Will, thus effectively ending the game. I thought that the significance would be that one side was religious, and one demonic, and that the father was always on the religious side. This could have been representative of God the father, who would always win. But the fact that the demonic side is about to win, and then the game just abruptly ends, threw me. Is there a metaphor hee that I&#039;m just not seeing?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Overall, I found this story interesting and enjoyable. One of the story&#039;s strongest aspects was the fact that it grabbed my interest at the beginning and only heightened that throughout. I think that starting in the middle of the story, rather then establishing a setting and characters and background information first, was the main reason for this.

Also, I was very interested in how the story would ultimately end. This was because I was invested in the main character, Will, very much. Not only did the author of this story make the main character come to life, but he did the same for every character in this story, and especially Regina. He wasn&#039;t judging any of his characters or telling readers what to think about them. The author simply presented the facts and allowed us to make opinions of our own. Because the characteristics displayed from Regina though, such as the long hair and home-schooling and great piety, usually come together to form a certain person, I was able to assume a bit more about her life, which I found really useful.

Overall, I really liked this story. It was one that I enjoyed reading from beginning to end.]]></description>
