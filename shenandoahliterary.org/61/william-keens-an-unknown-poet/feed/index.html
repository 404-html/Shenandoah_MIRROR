					<description><![CDATA[These poems by William Keens, with their astonishing clarity and beauty, leave me speechless.  Maybe John Keats said it best, something that can be applied to William Keens and his poetry:

&quot;Beauty is truth, truth beauty,&quot; - that is all 
        Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am so delighted to hear of Bill and how he fared.  I am not surprized that his poetry is still wonderful.  It always was.  Bill was a classmate of mine at UNCG and indeed one of the most intense people I have ever known.  We had a long discussion one night at the Pickwick about what the moral thing to do with our lives would be.  Should we work outside the system to protest the hypocrasy and the control of the super rich, or inside the system to change it.  I was a baby reporter, so I voted for inside to change it. He didn&#039;t want to abandon his art. I was convinced that you could do both. Bill has shown that you still can.  I hate that he has Parkinson&#039;s. That is a cruel disease, but he still has the great gift he was given and hopefully will use it as much as possible to share as long as he can.  That&#039;s really all any of us get. I&#039;m thrilled to see his work again.

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so glad to find these poems---Bill was a student at UNCG when I was in the MFA program. I remember him at a distance, looking intense, yes indeed, even a bit scary!   I knew his work was much admired by Bob Watson and Fred Chappell, but I didn&#039;t know much about it then.   I&#039;m sorry to hear of his Parkinson&#039;s, but these luminous poems have made his &quot;slowing down&quot; seem like a gift to the art of poetry, enabling him, and his readers, to see the paradise shimmering through the keyhole.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For me, the most interesting aspect of this piece is not in its content, but in its presentation. It is very innovative how Adcock combines a personal nonfiction essay with an analysis of Keens&#039; poetry.  While the essay starts out as a straight analysis, it markedly changes when Adcock asks, &quot;Why write about a book that will never appear in a bookstore? And who is William Keens?&quot; This transition helps contextualize the poetry and explain exactly why the poems are notable. While the poems are great on their own, the more traditional essay-like section towards the end is the strongest part of this piece.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bill&#039;s startling diction, his lyricism, deft use of trope, and flirtation with the supernatural all make for poems that are singularly evocative and, at times, almost hypnotic.  But they are actuated by real and grtitty human concerns.  This is not an empty fashion show.  I think he fully deserves the praise he receives in this article.  One can only hope that his work reaches a broader audience.]]></description>
