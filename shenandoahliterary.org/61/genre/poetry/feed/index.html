								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sound begins with a furnace<br />
clicking awake in a two-room house, answered<br />
by a few, then more, voices: gauges,</p>
<p>and old-fashioned watches ticking out of synch, in growing number,<br />
so their tip-tip-tip fattens to a moan, joined</p>
<p>by a horn’s upbeat honkity-honk, then ringtones and speakers<br />
rehearsing drawn horsehair, air in a woodwind, mimicking</p>
<p>a hand slapping a polyester drumhead, but unlike<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; these coarser frictions, playing the same, every time.<br />
A car door bangs, a jackhammer hammers, and a bassline</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; purrs through a wall. The sound congeals,<br />
sucking in more, a mechanical syrup in an IV drip, the automatic</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ruckus of a robotic ocean, a symphony<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;no one wrote, confounding every pattern:</p>
<p>teach me the song that no one can sing, someday<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to be the song of everything.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What I mean is I&#8217;m digging<br />
in the garden or just walking<br />
dully along, going on<br />
with my boggy life, when it<br />
snaps me up like a mouse,<br />
a snack for the hawk of grief<br />
and like a car antennae<br />
my tail whangs in the air.<br />
The wind harps my whiskers<br />
as too stunned to squeak, I&#8217;m sported<br />
farther and farther into edgelessness.</p>
<p>Scientists say gravity is good<br />
for making grass and trees stand up,<br />
suns jostle, bodies fall,<br />
but they can&#8217;t say what it is.<br />
Close and tight and sweet<br />
as mounded dirt, cover the length of me.<br />
It&#8217;s good to be held down</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The little house climbs from winter afraid<br />
of its own weakness.  The door, the cedar shakes.<br />
The knot of leaves in the porch corner drowses<br />
in the sunlight.  The frost sizzles and rises.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to find a word, a sentence, a handle<br />
for the color of the dead grass.  Gradually</p>
<p>in spasms of thaw, the grade of the continent<br />
takes the snow and other omens.  Squirrel nests<br />
hang like brains in the trees, rocking, rocking.<br />
Behind the house, daffodils.  Right and reckless.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Perfumes, hues, and sounds echo one another.<br />
—C.B.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nature as pillared temple – I’ll go along,<br />
even accept that columns speak,<br />
though the words are mumbled, muted.</p>
<p>Yes to perfumes mellow as oboes – maybe malachite-blue? –<br />
or perfumes depraved as horns, yellow as tamarind wood.</p>
<p>Crimson for Sousa’s brass and shine,<br />
and for Bessie Smith, scales of hues ascending violet to red<br />
with chromatic half-tones: yellow-orange, chartreuse.</p>
<p>Consider a red-brick church in New Orleans<br />
that barely stands, flood line ten feet high.<br />
A boy with a cello cracked at the bridge<br />
stares at heat rising to stained glass boarded shut.</p>
<p>If I paint this scene in oils, viscous as pitch,<br />
can I make the rosin sing?</p>
<p>If light travels faster than sound,<br />
can I measure the cost of a blink?</p>

while I tend thistle, mountain laurel, sage<br />
and a tumbleweed fire – hearthless, undying.</p>
<p>Nothing lasts for long above the tree line –<br />

Jupiter spades the earth and sows the sky</p>
<p>with pigeons, centaurs, bears and broken lyres.<br />
Music tuned to loss descends with rain.<br />
I tend a tumbleweed fire – artless – that cannot hide</p>
<p>plots where nothing grows, where I’ve<br />
planted diadems, Mother’s pearls and peacock tails.<br />
Jupiter spades the earth and sows the sky.</p>
<p>In this rock garden, under a layer of schist, lies<br />
swan’s down, white and tender – oh so tender – saved<br />
from a tumbleweed fire – breathless and blind;</p>
<p>darts from Cupid’s bow that have strayed;<br />
Semele’s heart and Lamia’s eyes.<br />
Jupiter spades the earth and sows the sky.<br />
I tend a tumbleweed fire – heartless, unbridled.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I came home from work, I saw a package for him,<br />
so I took it up to the sixth floor where he lived.<br />
I was puffing a bit since I wasn’t used to the climb.<br />
I lived on the second floor of the same building<br />
with busted mailboxes and marble steps, worn thin<br />
towards the side nearer the banister from all those years<br />
of people ascending and descending—the immigrants first,<br />
then the working poor, and now drug addicts and artists.<br />
There was no doorman, and in place of our buzzer,<br />
just a few dangling red wires. The mailman dumped<br />
packages and magazines onto the floor<br />
of our phone booth-sized foyer. The second metal door<br />
had a square of mesh over the glass window<br />
because someone had smashed it in.<br />
Everything was painted a spooky gray,<br />
and the halls smelled like must and mold.<br />
Most of the blue and cream tiles<br />
that I imagined were once beautiful<br />
were broken or missing. The maintenance man<br />
my roommate called “a junkie with a hammer”<br />
had put some pink putty that looked like old bubblegum<br />
in places where the tile was completely gone.<br />
I was curious about the man who subscribed<br />
to <em>Art Forum</em> and <em>Spy</em> and <em>Time</em>, all of which<br />
I had been stepping over in the foyer.<br />
His fed ex box was heavy in my arms<br />
as I climbed those eroded warped stairs<br />
which were hard to negotiate, like walking<br />
on a beach, one foot in the water,<br />
the other on an incline in wet sand.<br />
There was an occasional crack vial on a landing<br />
that I’d kick into a corner. When he opened the door<br />
he was just like the neighborhood, tragic<br />
and ravished and exquisite. He was holding</p>
<p>his arm in a bunch of bloody paper towels.<br />
He’d just put his fist through a glass coffee table<br />
at his girlfriend’s place—she lived<br />
a few blocks north and west. They’d had a fight,<br />
and he was picking out translucent slivers<br />
from his arm. I wondered if he’d also smashed the glass<br />
on the metal security door. When I knocked,<br />
he probably thought I was the girlfriend,<br />
begging to take him back. I looked over his shoulder<br />
at the mattress on the floor, the tiny refrigerator<br />
like college kids have in dorms. As he told me<br />
his troubles, they seemed to drift into the past,<br />
and I knew that I’d be his next girlfriend.<br />
He was forty and I was twenty-eight, a little out of breath<br />
from the stairs, a little beyond grad school, but not much.<br />
A poet, I said. A painter, he said. I’ve lived here two years, I said.<br />
Eighteen years for me. He had the old kind of apartment<br />
that was not yet renovated, a toilet in the hall<br />
that he shared with two other bachelors on his floor.<br />
A filthy bowl that no one bothered to clean,<br />
a dusty light bulb with a chain, a defunct lock<br />
that looked as though, at one point, might have been<br />
accessed by a skeleton key. I went into his apartment<br />
and sat on his mattress, as there were no chairs<br />
or couch. He said, You want a drink? His walls were blank.<br />
I contemplated asking where all his paintings were,<br />
but instead I took the tweezers from his shaking hand<br />
and began to pull out the shards from his palm.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/Denise-AnUnmarriedWoman.mp3">An Unmarried Woman</a></p>
<p>(for Jill Clayburgh, 1944-2010)</p>
<p>When I first saw it, I was a high school junior. Jill Clayburgh was scandalous<br />
ballet dancing in her tee shirt and panties, showing her teenage daughter<br />
a wet spot on the bed after she’d made love to her husband, the girl’s father.</p>
<p>I was fascinated by Clayburgh’s lip gloss and feathered hair.<br />
I had a Fair Isle sweater just like hers and wanted the crazy cape<br />
in which she wraps her new lover on a cobblestone street in New York.</p>
<p>I didn’t understand then, of course, that I would someday be divorced<br />
after sixteen years of marriage, just like her character, throwing up<br />
on a sidewalk just like she did, jittery in a therapist’s office,</p>
<p>having an awful blind date, eating dim sum with a stranger<br />
who would try to kiss her in a cab. Instead of pirouetting<br />
to “Swan Lake,” I jumped around the apartment, singing</p>
<p>along with Pink and Beyoncé. Back then, in 1978, I didn’t quite get<br />
betrayal’s depths. I just liked Jill’s outfits—the skirt and tank in the final scene<br />
that reminds me now of Sarah Jessica Parker’s ensemble in the opening credits</p>
<p>of Sex and the City. When her artist-lover gives Jill a giant painting<br />
as he heads off to Vermont for the summer and she carries it through Soho,<br />
fumbling and twisting in the wind, you can’t help but root for her,</p>
<p>just as I am rooting for myself, watching this movie again on DVD<br />
thirty years later, part of my post-divorce Netflix recovery.<br />
Jill is in the obituaries (credit <a href="http://www.dresshead.com/dresshead-staff-profile-joann-whiteside" style="text-decoration: none;color: #333">joann</a> at <a href="http://www.dresshead.com" style="text-decoration: none;color: #333">here</a>). Breast cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia—</p>
<p>how can that be? She looks so young and fresh as she ice skates<br />
with her pals, runs along the East River where her husband steps in dog shit<br />
and blames her. When I first saw <em>An Unmarried Woman</em>, I went with my friend</p>
<p>and, if I remember correctly, we were freaked out by the sex scenes<br />
and barely acknowledged Jill’s bland teenage daughter<br />
who would have been about our age. Afterwards, at Friendly’s, we talked</p>
<p>about the pickled herring arc. Jill’s lover tells the story<br />
about how his mother threw a jar towards his father’s head<br />
and how, as he watched the fish smash against the wall, he decided</p>
<p>to become an abstract painter. Towards the end of the movie,<br />
the lover himself lobs a jar at Jill when she doesn’t do what he wants.<br />
My friend told me her mother hurled a bottle of applesauce at her father</p>
<p>and when she missed, the stuff ruined the wallpaper.<br />
That was just marriage, we guessed, sipping our frappes.<br />
We put our hands over our hearts and pledged we’d never wed</p>
<p>even as the cute boys came in, crowding into a booth<br />
across from us. We blushed and giggled despite ourselves.<br />
Adults, we agreed, were crazy—we wanted no part of their messes.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/Names-by-a-River.mp3">Names by a River</a></p>
<p>The keels of the Speedwell and Discoverer<br />
four hundred years ago passed over<br />
where I am walking among the glasswort<br />
and Hudsonia this morning, the river’s<br />
estuary here then. Before Bradford<br />
and Miles Standish you came<br />
with fifty men in armor out of Bristol,<br />
barely a man yourself, nevertheless<br />
Captain Martin Pring, from your portrait<br />
I’d say a handy little dude like Standish<br />
and John Smith, your chin-beard sharp<br />
as a poinado. Enough mitten-shaped leaves<br />
of the sassafras here to make a homeward cargo<br />
for both holds, you calculated &#8212; a possible cure<br />
for the French pox. A kingbird works<br />
the dune grasses for insects this morning,<br />
at what you named Whitson Bay after<br />
a prime investor in your voyage.</p>
<p>All that is left of 1603 has been shifted,<br />
wind and sea, ground down, sorted, re-pummeled,<br />
blown sideways, sea and wind, processed and<br />
overlain with grasses and snows among the vagaries<br />
of the river, itself renamed: Pamet now for the tribe<br />
you pressed into flight with the mastiffs<br />
Gallant and Fool. After a few thousand walks<br />
among the nesters here, I call these dunes<br />
and flats Egg Island, in part to confuse<br />
the local hiking club, identical in their<br />
baggy shorts and yellow T-shirts, their catalog<br />
explorer hats, outfits absurd as those you gifted<br />
the natives with, those “divers sorts of<br />
meanest merchandise.”</p>
<p>Who do I think I am, since only change<br />
is unchanging here: Whitson’s Bay<br />
to Egg Island, and your Mount Aldworth<br />
to Tom’s Hill, after a last Pamet<br />
who lived up there? Even the French pox<br />
has run through a litany of names,<br />
not many as impugning, but all as colorful,<br />
the Grandgore, the Black Lion,<br />
and the sassafras itself went into<br />
root beer. You stayed seven weeks, then sailed<br />
from the August heat inimical to northern blood.</p>
<p>Since mariners read the birds, though<br />
you wouldn’t have names for some, no doubt<br />
you saw the flocks dropping down<br />
and reforming for the south, semipalmated<br />
plovers this morning, big name for a brief<br />
flash of white with half-webbed feet,<br />
their migration begun, but you didn’t<br />
stay on for the grand transitions &#8212;<br />
a stray albatross, wing-broken, rolled over<br />
the dunes in a January blow, or the way<br />
a north wind surprises a walker as he faces<br />
about into it. Pilgrims, briefly, converting<br />
to whalers, then trap fishermen &#8212; would you<br />
have called them Portingales? &#8212;<br />
and the fish houses, ice houses, coal-fired freights,<br />
and the river forever trying new entries and<br />
departures between Corn Hill and Fisher’s Beach,<br />
scouring its bed into sandbars, undermining,<br />
making runs up the valley, trying to join<br />
the Atlantic at the farther shore.</p>
<p>And here, as I read the flats this morning,<br />
going side-by-side with a set of tracks, a dog<br />
at first, but no mastiff: feet too narrow,<br />
heel pads flat at the back, and no splay,<br />
so more likely a coyote, perhaps one of those<br />
you called “dogs with sharp and long noses.”<br />
The names never stick, as if in the naming<br />
the thing itself is changed. These whorls<br />
in the riverbed could be the fingerprint of God,<br />
and the slow motion whip-cracks of the river<br />
keep flexing over time between headlands.</p>
<p>SENTRY</p>
<p>Thistle, you look like another<br />
of evolution’s jokes, impossible<br />
as a great blue heron seems<br />
impossible, though you both<br />
are brilliant survivors.</p>
<p>Still, mixed metaphor,<br />
it looks like someone<br />
hung you all over with<br />
shaving brushes nobody<br />
soft-handed could wield,</p>
<p>then loaded one of those<br />
salad shooters they<br />
used to hawk on TV<br />
and fired green sickles<br />
and scimitars at you,</p>
<p>until, sentry at my door,<br />
you look like a gallowglass<br />
loyal to no one but your own<br />
stickle-backed containment.</p>
<p>I dubbed you Captain Barfoot,<br />
though I know from long<br />
acquaintance that a change<br />
of air will turn you to a mentor</p>
<p>white and silken, proof<br />
that the pilgrim in us all<br />
must cede his spines<br />
and hackers to endure.</p>
<p>STRIPED MAPLE HISTORY</p>
<p>The stump looked like a medical illustration<br />
of a heart, and its few wispy sprouts<br />
showed me it wanted to live, so I planted it<br />
by the door thirty years ago.</p>
<p>Each fall before the winds I still cut one side away<br />
from the windows and trim out several fine<br />
straight sticks sturdy enough for beanpoles.</p>
<p>So now, lopsided, a few branches looped and snaking,<br />
it is grandly disreputable, nothing of the nursery<br />
about it, and its three-lobed leaves, looking like<br />
goose prints, turn yellow as October cools so it seems</p>
<p>fall’s counterpoint to forsythia. Called goosefoot<br />
some places, here it is nicknamed whistlewood:<br />
a smart kid with a jackknife can reverse it to wood whistle.</p>
<p>Considered a pest of the understory by foresters,<br />
it can live to be a hundred. I have stood under it<br />
as a two-foot baby redtail hawk grappled through its twists,<br />
wings trapped open or akimbo, shaking down</p>
<p>flocks of propellering fruit upon a fleeing chipmunk<br />
and me. And all this spring a male yellowthroat<br />
&#8212; a warbler with a black mask like a cartoon<br />
housebreaker’s &#8212; has been jerking its tail</p>
<p>as furiously as a wren and knocking at its own<br />
reflection in the windows, defending its nest secreted<br />
somewhere in the maple, even while showing</p>
<p>without knowing it that we have to look into<br />
ourselves to look out for ourselves, and see<br />
through our dubious aspects.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thistle, you look like another<br />
of evolution’s jokes, impossible<br />
as a great blue heron seems<br />
impossible, though you both<br />
are brilliant survivors. </p>
<p>Still, mixed metaphor,<br />
it looks like someone<br />
hung you all over with<br />
shaving brushes nobody<br />
soft-handed could wield,</p>
<p>then loaded one of those<br />
salad shooters they<br />
used to hawk on TV<br />
and fired green sickles<br />
and scimitars at you, </p>
<p>until, sentry at my door,<br />
you look like a gallowglass<br />
loyal to no one but your own<br />
stickle-backed containment.</p>
<p>I dubbed you Captain Barfoot,<br />
though I know from long<br />
acquaintance that a change<br />
of air will turn you to a mentor </p>
<p>white and silken, proof<br />
that the pilgrim in us all<br />
must cede his spines<br />
and hackers to endure.   </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>&#8220;Then a horrible thought came to me. I was dead, of course, and death was nothing but a continuation of life as it had been when one left it. . . . This is what purgatory was&#8211;or was it hell itself? My body was dead, but I was there too. I went into a stupor, hardly conscious. . . . At last &#8212; how long I don’t know &#8212; the knocking came again.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8211;Eugene O’Neill on his suicide attempt</p>
<p>Those days, he felt like a walking text, God-less, feigned,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a book not even the author understands, the self<br />
he thought he was only a linguistic hologram in a self-revising brain.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Most mornings, he spent writing drafts and throwing<br />
them away, trying to find a crescendo through his layers of disguise,</p>
<p>through the ticks and demarcations, the language like a dancer<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dancing the dance of seven veils around his head,<br />
a beautiful distraction, a swirl of feathers independent<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of a bird, no center, no storm-eye where<br />
that therapeutic emptiness might dwell, everything feeling artificial,</p>
<p>everything contrived, the forged prescriptions crumpled in his hand,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the sidewalks laid out like a crossword puzzle<br />
at his feet, as he walked the city with one ear tuned to the fatal shore,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; like Odysseus bound to the masthead, fearful<br />
yet restrained, his disgust towards his parents, towards the world,</p>
<p>slowly twisting inward, like the edge of something burned.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He gave a performance for each pharmacist,<br />
wincing, holding a hand against his side to fake a bit of pain,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the kind of thing his mother must have done when she had<br />
to have her morphine, each pharmacist sighing, turning obligingly away,</p>
<p>like the turn that signals a soliloquy, the self stripped bare before<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; an audience, like my body as they peeled my clothes away,<br />
the parchment-yellow skin, the disease scribbled everywhere,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the doctors reading, easily, the message in my swollen feet,<br />
in the sweat laced with my body’s waste, the compost heap</p>
<p>of my dirty clothes piled at their feet, the cut-off shorts, the underwear,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; each heartbeat being sucked into a stethoscope,<br />
an IV placed, the nurse with a fist around the plasma bag,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; trying to squeeze the platelets in, that boy leaving me<br />
while the blood of yet another stranger was pumped into my veins,</p>
<p>as if I were an actor switching roles, O’Neill drugged, passing out,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; vacant as a house behind a set design, the music<br />
moving through him, electricity and feathers, that vertigo, that swift<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; inward falling, his body like a word overgrown<br />
with implications, the small flame of its meaning trampled out,</p>
<p>a wince, a muscle-flutter, shock. All morning, I’ve been trying<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to make a song from the body’s gaps, its scars<br />
and biopsies, its errors, its transparencies, the breath<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; like something written and constantly erased,<br />
the flaw in me at birth no radar could detect, the slow erosion</p>
<p>of my kidney, the plankton of my leukocytes devouring the shore.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All morning, I’ve felt like a man running his fingers<br />
through the ash, sifting through his biographies, his plays,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the words, like blood cells filled with oxygen, briefly<br />
inflating as I read &#8212; his restless, untouchable silence,</p>
<p>that strange tethering of funeral and song behind his eyes &#8212;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; though the answers never really come, because<br />
the language like the body has no stasis point, can’t be solved,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; only organized, swept up into the jet stream<br />
of our thoughts, my own words jointed together in my sloppy</p>
<p>grade-school penmanship, balanced against each other, like a pile<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of twigs, or simplified into opposites &#8212; past/future, him/<br />
me &#8212; like those bars of light and shade hauled in through the window<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; blinds and laid across my chest this morning<br />
like a music staff, my body a box of piano strings, waiting to be struck,</p>
<p>the music fading now, the chair, O’Neill confused, thinking there’s<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; someone singing in the room, his body like a fog crawling<br />
through the windowsills, through the empty bottles on the floor,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so that as I remember, as I write, as I inhale him and speak<br />
him back into the air, he stirs, he hears me knocking at the door.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When they’ve seen the vision of their own bones<br />
corpsed with the creatures whorled into the stone,<br />
when they feel their bodies turning hieroglyphic</p>
<p>in the cave, each ax-stroke echoing, internally, their own<br />
decay, do trapped miners still fidget in the mountainside,<br />
or do they sit and listen to each other die? That’s</p>
<p>how I imagine it, tranced by the ventilator’s hydraulic drive,<br />
my father comatose, his mind like the quiet of the hospital<br />
at night, dim but still electrified, post-lingual and numb,</p>
<p>though that, too, must be imagined, everything beyond my grasp<br />
tonight, the nurses swanning silently in the halls, my mother asleep<br />
in some distant lounge, though she, too, seems to occupy only</p>
<p>the backyard syntax of my youth, her sadness as foreign to me<br />
as these other patients in these other rooms, one of whom I watched<br />
die last night, the room hung like a painting at the end of a dark</p>
<p>hallway, so bright it seemed I had projected it, her body &#8212; was it<br />
a girl? &#8212; small as a newborn calf curled in the sheets, the mother<br />
with her head pressed to her chest, as if what grief wants most</p>
<p>is to enter the bodies of those who’ve died. The grandparents<br />
stood at a tactful distance from the bed, two old somber farmers,<br />
holding hands, and me in the hallway like some helpless angel.</p>
<p>But no, more like &#8212; I’m ashamed of this &#8212; a man who’d<br />
wandered into the rehearsal for some play, their grief so far<br />
away, so vague, so unreal, that I understood how inadequate</p>
<p>my own gestures of sadness had become, my weeping, my<br />
siblings and I passing each other like shift workers in the halls,<br />
nothing sufficient, no way to put into words that black spot</p>
<p>in a mind that will not speak. Tonight, I’d like my father’s<br />
mind to expand and hold me in its vacancy, but the silence<br />
between us is just another argument, his body saying emptiness</p>
<p>and me turning to watch his numbers drifting downward on<br />
the screen. This morning, I watched as the room in which the girl<br />
had died was cleaned, the sheets bagged, the smell of ammonia</p>
<p>erasing her presence from the air. I wanted to be clean<br />
for my father’s loss, to build myself around him like a cave,<br />
but here, at the edge of death, thoughts freeze like water,</p>
<p>or so Descartes once wrote, in some other city, some other time,<br />
coughing himself into a mucous cup, the harbor frozen<br />
in the window at his bedside, that city he hated walking</p>
<p>itself through him as he died, he who knew that we die without<br />
one person, ever, having entered our minds, that the silence<br />
we are heading for is the one we’ve always occupied.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>I am God&#8217;s wheat, and I am to be ground by the teeth of wild beasts, so that I may become the pure bread of Christ<br />
&#8212; Ignatius of Antioch, Letter to the Romans</p></blockquote>
<p>On those nights when the moon was curled outside his window<br />
like a lion&#8217;s tooth, he’d ink and conceal the buried weather<br />
of his doubt, that deceiving angel ripping through him as his body</p>
<p>cantered and swayed against the sides of the boat, the cell contracting<br />
around him like a womb, as if to die was to be born adrift on dark<br />
and shoreless ether, the flesh telling him that flesh is all there is,</p>
<p>until there was no choice except to hate the body,  its desires<br />
and seals, rot and moldered lies, an ossuary of bones,  the body<br />
already dead, St. Paul said, because of sin, the soul a spit</p>
<p>of light passing through the wreckage of a ship, a glow-<br />
worm quickening the soil of us, these thinking graves, these plots<br />
we press up against each other, my wife convexed along my back</p>
<p>on those nights when our unborn daughter pulsed and swayed<br />
between us like a lamp or a fragile ark in which our chromosomes<br />
were packed, her body glowing because it wasn&#8217;t quite a body yet,</p>
<p>so that I&#8217;d see behind my eyes that translucent skin I&#8217;d seen<br />
in pictures, a mollusk swamped around its pearl at first, then the lava<br />
of creation expanding as it cooled, that rumpled cord linking her</p>
<p>not to her mother&#8217;s bloodstream, but to the other side of death,<br />
as if she were being poured into the womb, a self both tributarial<br />
and whole &#8212; larva, pupa, chrysalis, imago &#8212; that incantation mouthed</p>
<p>as prayer, though it didn&#8217;t help when she turned and the cord<br />
eeled around her neck, rupturing the monitor&#8217;s loose pentameter,<br />
so that until she turned again and slipped from the noose of elegy,</p>
<p>she was both alive and dead in me. Turn and counter-turn, flesh<br />
and rot of memory. No matter if the pearl, at first, is kissed<br />
into the womb, or if the shoreless angels flesh the glow, like tailors</p>
<p>gathered at our bones, these God-sphinxed chromosomes, fastened<br />
to the animal, inscribed with history, wear our bodies like a uniform,<br />
keep us swinging from incandescence to decay, the Saint</p>
<p>fathoms-deep in prayer and thrashed by the motions of the ship,<br />
his body like an anchor dragged forward by his faith, his vision<br />
of a violent purity billowing the sails, so that when he had to betray</p>
<p>either his body or his God, he wrote his executioners to entice the wild<br />
beasts, let them become his tomb, no matter if he recants himself<br />
or pleads, the flesh ruptured and caesarean, he sought, cleaved until</p>
<p>a soul begins to rise, my wife botanical and numbed upon the table,<br />
moaning for them to stop, her womb a vacancy, the smell of blood<br />
and disinfectant in the room, our daughter incised into the din &#8212;</p>
<p>a light broken from the emptiness, and the emptiness sewn in.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>And tomorrow there may be tiny eggs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bought from the farmer: yellow and gray and blue<br />
and his cheese, a small miracle dispatched<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from goats. There may be a llama taking<br />
grass between his teeth, whose chewing into jade saliva<br />
is like old poetry’s heartbreak, ancient couplets<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;riding the furred neck, a sound at once remote<br />
and inside the skin.</p>
<p>Tomorrow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it may be different, the water I was formed in<br />
will be old-fashioned, my family knocked from their seahorses,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from their dusky corners by my wedding,<br />
a day I’m certain of nothing and all things at once. My own<br />
future children layered in mute dust, an idea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;surfacing hotly then growing hidden again<br />
like the dog’s wet tongue.</p>
<p>Yesterday<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went to Angola’s prison rodeo and everywhere<br />
a sadness broke through. It was in the eyes of all animals, scared<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and tough and irrelevant. It was in the arms<br />
of the little girl, who raced her horse around a barrel before<br />
losing her hat and falling from her saddle after it, gravity<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a hoof-mooned, dirty wonder.<br />
Outside the ring ambulances hummed.</p>
<p>And beyond that,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the dusty lanes, well-behaved prisoners sold<br />
rocking chairs and belts. For five bucks one took our photo<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a mock cell with toilet and bed. I was there<br />
with my bridesmaid. We did our best to look condemned<br />
in striped shirts, the same as the prisoners.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The photographer was so polite, she and I joked about<br />
a double wedding. </p>
<p>Or another inmate holding Fat Girl, a black lab<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like my own. And on the way home, a dozen miles<br />
of bayou, we stopped at a bar where a former guard sold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;machine-spun daiquiris. She talked about her boyfriend<br />
somewhere back in Angola. And somewhere else, </p>
<p>I see headlines of priests and sexual trespass, a word<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that finds me as a child studying The Lord’s Prayer<br />
for confirmation.</p>
<p>And all this floats up like a pair of hands in supplication,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or a song broadcasting from Vatican Radio some new hit,<br />
and it’s me singing for all those children, and it’s god<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with a bouquet of baby’s breath, sadness momentarily put on hold.<br />
Tongues roll back into the mouth’s unlocked cell, and I think of<br />
the faithful and the chosen. How tomorrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be married.</p>
<p>And sometime after, I will think again of Fat Girl learning<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to roll over. I will think of the poor grade<br />
I made in geometry, all the future’s difficult math,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the secrets that we carry and accrue, the fingers<br />
of my children, fractions of time ever halving<br />
as it does in tri-fold mirrors for which we pay, the grace of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;miniature pardons, of men in flight for a moment<br />
as their horses leave them behind. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The child’s cry is a light that comes on in the house,<br />
when the street is empty and the trees are still.<br />
The light in the window gives voice to the cry,</p>
<p>so when the windows are closed, we still know<br />
her voice is pushing against the walls of her room.<br />
Her cry: a light that comes on in the house,</p>
<p>quivering the filaments in the bulbs, lifting<br />
her parents out of their beds in the dark; at times<br />
a neighbor’s light will echo the cry. Her voice</p>
<p>arriving from what seems to be nowhere—<br />
from inside such a tiny body, it comes on<br />
and on, that cry somehow filling the whole house</p>
<p>when her parents are sleeping, when the world<br />
is sleeping. Like a lighthouse beam it swings around<br />
and out of her body, flooding the window, a cry</p>
<p>emerging from inside a dream, a need or fear<br />
she can’t yet utter; all there is is her breath<br />
pushing the cry, the light coming on in the house—<br />
and her voice: a light planted deep in the cry.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After four months, the fever withdrew into her,</p>
<p>past the vanishing point, and now it was impossible</p>
<p>to remember how fully it had filled her,</p>
<p>like light soaking the tissue of a leaf. Outside,</p>
<p>the traffic thinned to a word—so we split a cigarette</p>
<p>on the porch with the speaker in the window</p>
<p>and listened to Robert Johnson press his voice</p>
<p>against the City (—a crystal quivering in the microphone).</p>
<p>The heavy book in my hands never opened—</p>
<p>it was there only to keep me still.</p>
<p>When the last song ended, the notes dropped</p>
<p>from their thumbtacks back into the soil,</p>
<p>and then the sky had grown noticeably darker—</p>
<p>it wasn’t late; it was simply going to rain.</p>

It is 1842 and Napoleon has returned to Paris<br />
as body-ash grey as the iron Seine,<br />
Fuseli and Lavater have worked all winter painting<br />
the soul’s character to flesh, each high forehead<br />
a cathedral vaulted for the mind,<br />
and in Italy Francesco Hayez paints this girl,<br />
not so much a portrait as a study, the oval<br />
of her face flattened and white as a cameo.<br />
He paints her disheveled as the rumpled flowers<br />
he places before her as if she, too, were perfumed<br />
to lush disintegration, her bodice a waxy sheet<br />
draped to falling, the lilies enveloped<br />
in their private fluted mouths. He extends no grace<br />
to her, but lets the light from one window<br />
cut down the side of her face, her dress<br />
pooling as if he can’t help himself, can’t stop<br />
unlocking in his mind the pearly sheen<br />
of each elasticized button, though she is sullen<br />
and slouched as any preteen, awkward<br />
in her new layers, and, in the muddied pools of her eyes,<br />
he paints the whole of her psyche in concentric rings,<br />
at once over-taxed as her mother and extravagantly<br />
swollen, a child in the mane of her disillusionment.<br />
Even the cross he gilds mid-fall, but she doesn’t catch it,<br />
doesn’t rearrange herself like a girl at the pool<br />
tugging up her suit, no, her hands<br />
are stiff in her dress, listless to deformity.<br />
Her face is like one who will take a beating<br />
without flinching, and isn’t that what this is,<br />
as she stands for him who cowers behind the screen<br />
of his canvas, he who props her up<br />
before the blank brick and tugs the dress<br />
from alignment, convincing himself he’s caught her<br />
in her undressed mind, this girl for whom<br />
martyrdom means holding very still<br />
that he can make of her madness and sex?<br />
In another century, a poet thinks himself<br />
the wind God and she the harp he’ll run the string<br />
of his breath through like bell-song, and like Chloris<br />
she lies for him, a burnished shell, her cones<br />
filling with his notes, though before long<br />
his flora clots in her throat, blood-flakes fern<br />
from her lips, and her own sound is stopped, guttural<br />
in her long white throat. What a familiar myth<br />
they enacted before the stone and ivy wall of Cambridge,<br />
1956, his arm yoking her as it would for seven years,<br />
her girlish smile, light trolling the shadows. Here solidity<br />
is defined by her vanishing, the aural white;<br />
he grows larger as she less palpable. Must there always be<br />
a vanishing twin in this unnatural partnership,<br />
or else the two-headed monster they became when she spoke,<br />
anger ticking in her throat? Hayez called his portrait Melancholia<br />
as though he knew her, knew what darkened her pupils<br />
to crushed pencil points was desire for annihilation, but it was he<br />
who wanted to see her ripe for the taking, as if there were nothing<br />
more to do with her but lift the seashell-blue<br />
of her dress and punish her as she asks to be punished.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is written in the folios<br />
of foliage starting to catch fire, burn, turn to yellow, red,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;or orange flames</p>
<p>that everyone will fall, flutter to the ground, and be ground down<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to nothing more<br />
than least leaf meal in a winter overcoat’s dark pocket.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At 92 years old<br />
my mother, amateur watercolor artist, feels the forest fire<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;that rages through</p>
<p>the hills around Great Barrington kindle her cold bones’ marrow.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She’s had a new<br />
furnace installed, whose forced hot air will blow her warm this winter</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and fan the fire<br />
within her. She wants “to find homes” for her last 60 watercolors<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;before she dies.</p>
<p>“They’re like children,” she says. “I want to see them go<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;out into the world<br />
and make their way. Or at least someone else should lug them</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to the dump.<br />
Not me!” Hung on her white walls or stashed in cupboards, closets,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;black leather portfolios,</p>
<p>or under beds, she is surrounded by her paintings like a matriarch<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;in a family<br />
reunion photo. Here are the places and seasons she’s lived through.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Within a shady park<br />
along a Parisian boulevard, two lovers kiss on a blue bench, wrap arms<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;around each other as if they</p>
<p>aren’t watercolor, but Carrara marble. A woman in a yellow skirt<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;swishes, bewitches<br />
watchers, sashays by, holding the hand of her thigh-high daughter</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;dressed in a red<br />
smock. April, 1954, and the plane trees spread the green<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;jigsaw puzzle</p>
<p>of their new leafage over everyone. A red car passes, then<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a green one. The afternoon<br />
is stop-and-go. I turn around. On the wall behind me</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I see purple New England<br />
mountains in winter. For the foreground’s snow my mother used<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the negative space of blank</p>
<p>rag paper itself. The gray calligraphy of a frozen creek<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;winds me<br />
toward a weathered, rust-colored barn and silo, behind which</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;stand an outbuilding<br />
and farmhouse with darkened windows. The bare trees’ branches<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;vein the sky,</p>
<p>blotting paper ink-splotched with blacks and grays, plus a few russet sunset<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;streaks to match the barn’s<br />
warped boards. Dusk, below zero, and no one ventures out</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;into this<br />
inhuman cold. Within the clouds’ dark Rorschach, a slow<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;giant caterpillar</p>
<p>with two horns crawls. Last night I programmed for my mother<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a telephone<br />
emergency help system. If she falls in her ground-level</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;condominium and can’t<br />
get up, she has only to push for four seconds the red panic button<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;on the white plastic pendant</p>
<p>she wears about her neck and her telephone will dial 911.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“My watercolors will<br />
be scattered farther than my ashes,” she tells me. “I have</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;pictures all over—<br />
California, England, Hong Kong, China, Dubai. Why I<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;had someone come up</p>
<p>to me at an outdoor art show years ago and say that he saw<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;one of my paintings<br />
in a New York City condo that a realtor walked</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;him through. He asked<br />
if the watercolor came with the condo. The realtor said no.”<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My mother estimates</p>
<p>that over the years she’s sold 600 pictures at the outdoor art shows<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;she used to go to<br />
every summer. To get rid of her last paintings, she gives them</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to silent auctions<br />
at church bazaars. “Once a woman stood all day in front of<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;my watercolor</p>
<p>and wrote down a bigger bid whenever someone else’s<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;topped hers.<br />
She wanted that picture so! I forget what it was of . . .”</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My mother shows me<br />
the painting she plans to donate to the Congregational<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Church’s Christmas</p>
<p>Raffle &amp; Rummage Sale. A gray gravel road leads to a tiny<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;white house<br />
about to be swallowed by the maples’</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;40-foot high<br />
flames. Tomorrow morning I’ll say goodbye to my mother<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and drive my rental car,</p>
<p>a white Chevy Cobalt, back to the airport. Outside her window<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;brittle brown leaves<br />
almost cover the lawn’s gray granite outcrop left millennia ago</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;by a glacier. “How much<br />
will you bid,” wind murmurs through the eaves, “for each charred leaf?”<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I would give my life.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href='http://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/04/dhartres.mp3'>Chartres in the Dark</a></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was almost sunset<br />
when the cathedral rose out of the rolling December farmland,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;fields still green</p>
<p>with winter wheat. One moment there was nothing but horizon<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and muddy sky.<br />
Then its two gray spires appeared as we drove over the next</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;hill. I first saw<br />
those red and blue rose windows—muted sunlight flooding through<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;leaded petals—</p>
<p>when I was 15, the age of our younger daughter Lucy. Because that dark<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;light had branded<br />
its afterimage on my brain, I was taking my family</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;37 years later<br />
to Chartres to show them stained-glass sunrise. By the time we reached<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the cathedral after countless</p>
<p>roundabouts, whose small red and white triangular signs said, “Cede<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the passage”<br />
or “You do not have priority,” it was dark. We walked the nave. I pointed</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to the now black<br />
mosaics of stained glass, tried to describe for my wife and two daughters,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;who had never seen them,</p>
<p>the haloed apostles. I failed, stood silent under extinguished<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;windows in the dim<br />
half-light of the south ambulatory, and had to imagine</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>La Belle Verrière</em>,<br />
the blue mother holding her rust-robed child while gold censers swung<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;incense over</p>
<p>their heads and angels bore white candles to light their winding<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;way. The dark<br />
glass illumined the boredoms and terrors of 12th-century</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;French peasants.<br />
Somewhere in the central window of the west façade, a mother lay bleeding<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;on a gold fourposter.</p>
<p>Joseph dozed on a chair. Their newborn cried himself beet-red,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;finally slept, watched over<br />
by a drooling ox. I remembered how once Dana and I</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;came down with flu<br />
simultaneously and lay in bed, sitting up only to vomit into mixing<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bowls, while our six-month-old</p>
<p>daughter Eleanor howled in her crib for milk. We were too sick to feed her.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I still discover scrap paper,<br />
stuck in old books, with long lists in Dana’s hand, “Right 2:40,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;left 5:05,” in red pen<br />
to help her keep track of which breast Eleanor, who’s now 19,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;had nursed last.</p>
<p>Right breast, left breast, her mother weaned her. I couldn’t find<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the window in which Christ,<br />
tied to a post, got beaten by two men, one with a cricket bat,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the other with a flail shaped<br />
like a broom. At 16 Eleanor had walked with the handsome stranger<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to his top-floor apartment where</p>
<p>he tried to rape her. She ran down 20 flights of stairs. In the starless<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charlemagne window,<br />
Roland pierced the black giant Ferragut with a silver sword</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;through his navel,<br />
the only vulnerable spot on Irongut’s body. To the left of the altar my father<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;hung crucified on Alzheimer’s</p>
<p>cross. My mother and I took him down from that tree, washed his wounds,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;perfumed his body,<br />
stuffed a stone in the open mouth of his grave. For nine centuries Charlemagne</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;had gazed at the Milky Way,<br />
cornucopia of God’s coronation jewels, and tried to read there<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;his fate or fortune</p>
<p>in the next day’s battle. I could not see how the three butchers hacked<br />
at legs of lamb<br />
on a long table. Or how two bakers carried a man-sized wicker basket</p>
<p>of round loaves<br />
hung on a pole they shouldered. The loaves looked like cobblestones.<br />
I was condemned to eat them</p>
<p>and shit blood. On our journey from Provence, my internal hemorrhoids<br />
had ruptured,<br />
turned the water in the toilet bowl—no getting around it—</p>
<p>the same unearthly red<br />
as the stained glass of Chartres, sunset or sunrise, cumulus<br />
clouds of blood</p>
<p>I flushed. Rose windows, because you showed me in the dead of winter<br />
how my small life<br />
shone through your blacked-out panes forty feet above me, I knelt</p>
<p>down in that empty<br />
cathedral. I kissed the old worn stones we walked on. Nothing<br />
could have been colder.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Young and Tender<br />
Zephyr Summer Squash Only $1.25 Per Lb.!”<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;says the sign</p>
<p>at the farmers’ market. Each one is a light-skinned zucchini<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;dipped halfway down<br />
into a vat of bright yellow wax and then pulled out. I fill</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a plastic bag<br />
with these hybrid vegetables, take them home to Dana, who pours<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;them into a white</p>
<p>bowl, weighs one in her palm, and exclaims, “How beautiful!<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They look like<br />
incredibly innocent dicks!” She always blurts out whatever</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;comes to mind.<br />
“Remember,” I ask her, “our first date at the Mine Shaft before<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;they changed its name</p>
<p>to Zanzibar’s?” Years later it became the Silver Fox. “We danced until<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;last call to the Neville Brothers.”<br />
When Aaron sang “Amazing Grace” a cappella in his wavering</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;whisper tenor, everyone<br />
stopped dancing and listened. “I remember when the Neville Brothers<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;were the Meters</p>
<p>and played Tipitina’s in the French Quarter,” replies Dana.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I hung out<br />
with Kurt Kasson &#038; the Wheeler Sisters. They all lived together</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;at the corner of Desire<br />
and Claiborne, but the band broke up. Joey sang such sassy scat!”<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An investment banker now</p>
<p>for Smith Barney, Jo Ellen uses that velvet voice<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;on the telephone<br />
to reassure her clients when their stocks go south.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She lent us<br />
her New York City apartment for two nights on our honeymoon.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had all her shoes</p>
<p>lined up, shelf after shelf in the walk-in closet—purple pumps,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;blue high heels, orange sandals,<br />
calf-length, white leather boots. I counted 77 pairs, which meant</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;that she could wear<br />
each one four to five times a year. They’d never wear out.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our honeymoon</p>
<p>was 22 years ago. Dana’s rheumatoid arthritis makes<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;her joints ache<br />
when it turns cold. Her bones are our barometer. We are no longer</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;young and tender<br />
zephyr summer squash. We listen to an old bootleg CD. Joey’s<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;high scatting harmonizes</p>
<p>with Lisa’s low silver notes on “What a Little Moonlight<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Can Do.”<br />
In 1973, everyone was 19 or 20. Whither with the summer</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;zephyr do we<br />
zither? Late August’s full moon rises—golden zero on the night’s<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;black balance sheet.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href='http://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/Rodericks_green_fields.mp3'>David Roderick reads &#8220;Green Fields&#8221;</a></p>
<p>1. Descendancy</p>
<p>Work: sowing what we could in a bog-seam<br />
until the lumper failed us, the horse potato,</p>
<p>the patron saint of butter. We couldn’t pay.<br />
Without a handle on our hunger, heather lay</p>
<p>crudely over the land. We did what we could.<br />
Now we curse the bailiff’s turf and around</p>
<p>our cottage bank a fair fire. So what if our<br />
muscles spindle to thread? Bear witness.</p>
<p>Watch while our nets split from witchery<br />
and crops bleed frost on a plank of dew.</p>
<p>Your name will be honored as ours are:<br />
forgotten. The cottage will kneel to scalpeen</p>
<p>and burn the grass around, scorched reeds,<br />
mustard needled to flame and crested soot.</p>
<p>You’re our roots and heat. We’re your cuttings<br />
stashed in a pocket. The air flexes</p>
<p>through old stone, dampened vine and stem.<br />
The walls un-vetch and chimney flies naked.</p>
<p>If our people can’t have it, nobody will—<br />
this ink surviving, an X on onionskin paper.</p>
<p>2. St. Brigid</p>
<p>She was a poor girl minding her cow<br />
and had no place to feed it but the roadside.</p>
<p>Then a rich man who owned the land<br />
came by and in a fit of pity said,<br />
“How much land would it take to give grass to the cow?”</p>
<p>“As much as my cloak will cover,”<br />
she answered, and the man said, “I will give that.”</p>
<p>She laid down her cloak then, and it spread<br />
out miles on every side, wool unfolding<br />
shadows of fields, the hills like warmth rushing in.</p>
<p>But soon a silly old woman came by<br />
and stopped and said, “If your cloak goes on<br />
spreading, our whole island will be free,”</p>
<p>and with that the cloak stopped and spread no more.</p>
<p>3. Groomers</p>
<p>Tumbling from sky the buzzards<br />
sweep fetchless, legs rearing out<br />
and down as they land. Their knived faces,<br />
voices claw-like: Hark, what goes here?<br />
You wouldn’t think it<br />
but each has its own character:<br />
Bald Bitch, The Warden, The Pillar of Pall.<br />
They’re studied. You’ll never touch<br />
the artifice of their masks<br />
or smell their breath, like rot.<br />
Before approaching, they talk,<br />
settling things. It’s a privilege, really,<br />
the company of their flock.<br />
One of them flicks your hair, flaps back,<br />
then they rummage your clothes by the roadside.</p>
<p>4. Daunt’s Rock</p>
<p>From this dark, salted deck<br />
creaking the sinews of its beams<br />
I wish I could swim to your barnacled back,<br />
pull hand-over-hand<br />
drenched in my woolen pluck.<br />
My legs trailing seaweed<br />
and shoulders tied with twine.<br />
I’d suffer your weather and little games.<br />
As if there were such thing as anchor.</p>
<p>5. Their Ship Near Its Longing</p>
<p>Home was an island moored to an empire.<br />
Home was a blister of blood in the yolk.<br />
Home was the storm that broke the mast<br />
when nobody warned the colleens.</p>
<p>Home was a biscuit wrapped in a kerchief.<br />
Home was a kerchief draped on a face.<br />
One way, launched from the harbor at Cobh<br />
as they keened the magpie’s gray.</p>
<p>Home was beyond the valleys of sea,<br />
a drink for the picker, a drink for the drum.<br />
Home was a prospect, those last few waves<br />
toward the shuttles of Lowell’s looms.</p>

<div class="indented"><strong>THE JUNEBUGS</strong><br />
<em>Hey boy come here &#8212; quick,</em><br />
&nbsp; so he dropped his rake and<br />
ran to the yard by the housewhere probably five hundred<br />
&nbsp; junebugs like a pile of emeralds<br />
and rubies glistened crawlingover each other under each other<br />
&nbsp; in the grass. <em>By god look at them<br />
fornicating</em>, he said and his sonsaid <em>Hold on, I got an idea</em>, and ran<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; to the house for the bundle of<br />
twine and gunpowder he had tied</p>
<p>together into a bomb for such<br />
&nbsp; a purpose and blew an equally<br />
glittering hole in the yard</p>
<p>a foot into the earth and the punch<br />
&nbsp; his father landed reverberated<br />
in his skull for the rest of his life</p>
<p>and when the assassin fired<br />
&nbsp; it was the last thing he saw &#8212;<br />
junebugs everywhere crawling</p>
<p>glistening in the tall summer grass.</p>
<p><strong>THE PALACE</strong></p>
<p>Sarah knew how to cipher<br />
&nbsp; and added up for her brother<br />
his exact age when he asked.</p>
<p>Twelve years three months<br />
&nbsp; nineteen days.&nbsp; She gave him<br />
her cakes.&nbsp; She pulled the fang</p>
<p>of a corn snake from the side<br />
&nbsp; of his foot.&nbsp; She hugged up<br />
on him and said she loved him.</p>
<p>She could sew a pair of pants<br />
&nbsp; for the King of England if<br />
she was given the cloth and</p>
<p>he wanted most of all to acquire<br />
&nbsp; for her such cloth.&nbsp; She likes<br />
to follow she said the raw gold</p>
<p>of her thoughts.&nbsp; She kept a cricket<br />
&nbsp; in her pocket all one summer.<br />
When she talked it was like a palace.</p>
<p>Often he saw his mother waving<br />
&nbsp; from the tower and smiling<br />
he thought when his sister talked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>THE SPOON</strong></p>
<p>Seeing what he could<br />
&nbsp; but would not be &#8212;<br />
a blacksmith a cooper<br />
&nbsp; a tailor a woodsman<br />
a farmer, his father</p>
<p>bought a fancy spoon<br />
&nbsp; made of silver from<br />
a neighbor and gave it<br />
&nbsp; to his son who would<br />
only read and read</p>
<p>and talk of books and<br />
&nbsp; when the boy who was<br />
certainly now a man<br />
&nbsp; doomed to a life unlike<br />
enough to his father’s</p>
<p>that all was probably<br />
&nbsp; lost between them<br />
he tucked the spoon<br />
&nbsp; with a deep oval valley<br />
hammered very thin</p>
<p>and a rose embossed<br />
&nbsp; at the end of the handle<br />
into a worn copy of<br />
&nbsp; the poems of Horace<br />
before the boy left</p>
<p>for good &#8212; the gesture<br />
&nbsp; a lasting singular<br />
note of goodbye to<br />
&nbsp; one for whom he could<br />
never provide anything</p>
<p>so fine it would shine<br />
&nbsp; in the sun or feed him<br />
or keep him alive. Go,<br />
&nbsp; it said. Go, my son.<br />
Eat. Drink. And thrive.</p>
<p>July 1831</p>
<p><strong>THE LAW</strong></p>
<p>Unnoticed for over 600 years<br />
in the sky the 39th clause<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of the Magna Carta</p>
<p>in small letter-shaped clouds<br />
floated and faded as<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they were read aloud:</p>
<p>“To no one will we sell<br />
or deny or delay right<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or justice.” He wondered</p>
<p>at it all. In the orchard<br />
in May he saw a hive<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of bees spelling the whole</p>
<p>of the Declaration in the trees,<br />
the fat queen being the dot<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of the i where “We hold</p>
<p>these truths to be self evident.”<br />
He learned by reading<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; everything he saw: rivers</p>
<p>moving slowly in the winter<br />
toward a thaw &#8212; like gold<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in the straw. The myriad</p>
<p>faces of strangers. Waterfalls.<br />
Self taught, he read each<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; document as natural law.</p>
<p><strong>THE RITUAL</strong></p>
<p>As every president<br />
&nbsp; before him<br />
when he entered<br />
&nbsp; the office</p>
<p>he was presented<br />
&nbsp; a rosewood<br />
box the exact size<br />
&nbsp; of a gun case</p>
<p>and the steward<br />
&nbsp; unlocked<br />
the smart brass clasp<br />
&nbsp; with a key</p>
<p>elaborately cast<br />
&nbsp; with the head<br />
of a dragon and<br />
&nbsp; the velvet</p>
<p>was pulled away<br />
&nbsp; as the steward<br />
gestured for Lincoln<br />
&nbsp; to pick up</p>
<p>the pocked gray<br />
&nbsp; thigh bone<br />
of Achilles<br />
&nbsp; and to say</p>
<p>aloud: <em>We are one</em><br />
&nbsp; in the Greek<br />
and to turn around<br />
&nbsp; three times</p>
<p>and return the relic<br />
&nbsp; to its case<br />
and tell no one<br />
&nbsp; which was done.</p>
<p>March 1861</p>
<p><strong>THE BUCKET</strong></p>
<p>Shock at what he was. Shock<br />
&nbsp; at what he’d done. The man<br />
all day was numb after this &#8212;</p>
<p>the unmitigated disaster at<br />
&nbsp; Bull Run. The dead everywhere<br />
his own responsibility, the running</p>
<p>away a necessity for the Union<br />
&nbsp; because of his own amateur<br />
performance as a commander.</p>
<p>He went to the barn to talk<br />
&nbsp; to his horse, he took an empty<br />
feed bucket and placed it over</p>
<p>his head like a bell and sat there<br />
&nbsp; with his horse in the darkness<br />
of his failure. The next day</p>
<p>his aides brought fifty books<br />
&nbsp; from the Library of Congress<br />
and he read each one aloud</p>
<p>from Machiavelli to the Iliad<br />
&nbsp; to the journals of Julius Caesar<br />
and stabbed himself discreetly</p>
<p>marking an X on his chest<br />
&nbsp; to remember his shame bleeding<br />
into his sleeves. Never again</p>
<p>would he leave the fighting and<br />
&nbsp; the dying exclusively to brave men<br />
he thought I have murdered<br />
such as these.</p>
<p><strong>THE SHOVEL</strong></p>
<p>Klong klong klong<br />
&nbsp; he remembers<br />
his angel-mother</p>
<p>banging a shovel<br />
&nbsp; on the stone step<br />
of the cabin door</p>
<p>killing three snakes<br />
&nbsp; at once klong &#8212;<br />
one, klong &#8212; two,</p>
<p>klong &#8212; three &#8212; these<br />
&nbsp; alternating<br />
and precise swings</p>
<p>one for each landed<br />
&nbsp; very quickly<br />
like the percussive</p>
<p>force of the mortars<br />
&nbsp; across the river<br />
in Virginia, the snakes</p>
<p>coiling and uncoiling<br />
&nbsp; in agony<br />
toward death &#8212; this</p>
<p>familiar American<br />
&nbsp; song banging<br />
at his doorstep.</p>
<p><strong>THE PHOTOGRAPH</strong></p>
<p>Blasted with light for the portrait<br />
&nbsp; that will be engraved on the penny<br />
the lines of his face grow deeper</p>
<p>until he blinks and coughs a little<br />
&nbsp; and rubs his eyes afterward saying &#8212;<br />
<em>alright then now it is your turn</em> &#8212;</p>
<p>so the photographer sets the powder<br />
&nbsp; and readies the camera for the amateur<br />
who eyes him now through the lens</p>
<p>in the dark of the hood &#8212; <em>now be still<br />
&nbsp; sir and take your medicine</em>. Not wanting<br />
to return yet to the war, more sitters</p>
<p>are found for the president including<br />
&nbsp; a chimney sweep walking by and<br />
a girl in a <a href="http://www.dresshead.com/ultra-mini-dress-daisy-print-yellow/">yellow dress with a bow</a></p>
<p>and then the two of us &#8212; reluctant to<br />
&nbsp; say no. Tomorrow six horses burn<br />
in the stables of the White House and</p>
<p>the sound of their screams and the look<br />
&nbsp; in their eyes will stay in his mind for<br />
another year or so. In eight minutes</p>
<p>in Cold Harbor 26,000 men will be lost.<br />
&nbsp; This man is the cause. He looks at us<br />
appraisingly and then the flash goes off.</p>
<p><strong>THE CAKE</strong><br />
At the intersection of 12th street and New York<br />
&nbsp; Whitman carried a loaf of sourdough bread<br />
under his arm like a newspaper and stopped</p>
<p>short for coming the opposite direction without<br />
&nbsp; looking up was the actor John Booth practicing<br />
his lines from Macbeth concerning the murder</p>
<p>of the king for tonight’s capitol performance.<br />
&nbsp; And as the actor passed the star-struck poet<br />
on the street Abraham Lincoln crossed suddenly</p>
<p>toward them and briefly between them mumbling<br />
&nbsp; his pardon as he brushed past them returning<br />
the last red taffeta evening dress his wife would</p>
<p>ever buy with his money, the box like a five-tiered<br />
&nbsp; wedding cake obscuring him, so heavy and large<br />
it pitched a little in front of him as he carried it</p>
<p>precarious in his arms and passed between John Booth<br />
&nbsp; and the poet who both stopped together in the street<br />
amazed to see such a thing &#8212; a huge white box</p>
<p>with crimson roses and a vine printed around<br />
&nbsp; the side floating away and turning the day &#8212; the fine<br />
multitudinous sea of the day &#8212; suddenly incarnadine.</p>
<p>Aug 1864</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>That a cardinal’s bright dart alights upon the branch<br />
means Non cogito, ergo sum &#8212;<br />
I don’t think, therefore I am.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But that’s not Mandarin!<br />
Still the tree’s petal-fall dusts us angelic,<br />
our arms feathered wings.</p>
<p>A fool’s errand, this search for meaning,<br />
metaphor the bed we lie and awaken in.<br />
Hey there, get off our cloud!</p>
<p>In this we grow lonely though not alone,<br />
the way my Cortland shimmers<br />
in a cloud of her own making.</p>
<p>I know what I said.  I said her.<br />
You’d like to know what I make<br />
of her secret, also ours.</p>
<p>Try this: forget the fate we’ll share,<br />
warm from the oven of our unmaking,<br />
soon these limbs winter bare.</p>
<p>Just don’t, let’s say,<br />
our arms petaled feathers.<br />
This once: Don’t think.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I want to know these scoured rocks<br />
the way a blind woman knows her house,<br />
understand their journey, listen </p>
<p>to the creak of a glacier in my bones.<br />
I want to open the door for a pileated<br />
woodpecker, catch splintering </p>
<p>water as it falls, dream beneath the hush<br />
of hemlocks cresting the gorge and sense<br />
in their darkness the absent river’s </p>
<p>surge.  I want to feel the shift<br />
of a continent, see orchids as snow falls,<br />
then sink into pouches of jewelweed </p>
<p>filling Gypsy Gulch with a ginger glow.<br />
I want to track wild turkeys<br />
as they winter in Box Canyon, bend </p>
<p>low before their rafter of wings,<br />
meet, palm to palm, my own blood-brother<br />
in iron stains leaching through the wall.</p>

		<title>Spilled Milk on Banjo</title>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>when the dogwood petals begin to fall<br />
a glass of milk knocked over on the grass<br />
like the glass I spilled on my mother&#8217;s banjo<br />
a skin of change across the morning<br />
table she&#8217;d laid it on when I was six<br />
when the dogwood petals begin to drift<br />
then I am less and when they are torn<br />
in a startling hard spring rain I am<br />
unmoored as the tree is ripped<br />
so all its milky petals on the ground<br />
just disappear they will not return<br />
no more excursions from the branch<br />
this year the banjo my mother stroked<br />
with her clicking silver finger picks<br />
like claws like machine gears flashing<br />
faster and faster her curved hands<br />
raking across the strings such ringing<br />
echoes from that hollow drum<br />
and its tightened skin by accident<br />
on the glassy disk of her instrument<br />
I knocked the glass of milk so quickly it<br />
ran I think I laughed then thinking<br />
change was pretty overlaid silver skin<br />
thin running liquid when the dogwood<br />
leaves begin to fall – no, petals – leaves<br />
still hang their secrecies tenacious<br />
but without the incandescent spread<br />
across the morning and at night<br />
amid the other darknesses petals<br />
flaring a skeletal miracle<br />
I am sad girls are indelicate banjo<br />
strings taut in their silver girdle<br />
sharp in memory as my mother<br />
calls out the petals already fallen<br />
which tells us spring is over now forget</p>

<p><em>North Carolina Blue Ridge</em></p>
<p>Here earth juts and tumbles in woods<br />
where mountain creeks purl, slake through<br />
rock, sluice schist coves and sheltered</p>
<p>gaps, then push hard through piebald sheer,<br />
down to the slant of a cabin leaning:<br />
Dusk’s long shadow flickers dark</p>
<p>in this singular room, where my kin huddle<br />
around bacon and cabbage that snaps,<br />
burbles over pine-hiss and ember—</p>
<p>Fire grinds the weight of nightfall<br />
on their silence, toil-dark scowls<br />
over tight frowns, throats hungry</p>
<p>to down day’s reaping. Here, land<br />
is the sole tongue, etched in intricate syntax<br />
of apple and trillium, the garden’s blood-idiom,</p>
<p>husk-dry stanzas quenched by prophecies<br />
of rain. Nights, when their worn out bodies<br />
die into sleep, their dreams are rationed</p>
<p>to applewood and rattlers, valleys’ tobacco<br />
and fodders stacks, the few words passed<br />
that I take with me, write down, and move on.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dusks a blue smolder of memory:<br />
Your grandfather fades behind the creak<br />
of the barn door, mouth trembling with sermons<br />
lodged forever behind his tongue. You breathe</p>
<p>dust and drink the well’s rust-water,<br />
then slog in the heat of horses,<br />
saddled by noon rains, mud choking the yield.<br />
Nights, back in the stanch purity of those rooms,</p>
<p>with soap-burned hands you wrap your head<br />
with words: sorghum and lantern, cellar and sin.<br />
Then down into image, the earth’s nightlong gift:<br />
Your mother’s scarred hands fondling the plump coinage</p>
<p>of tomatoes, the pox of aphids washed immaculate.<br />
Her gloves uncoiling barbed wire, gauzing the reddening scrape.<br />
The hiss and warmth of embers, cedar-smoke’s tang.<br />
Always she dims again beneath black water</p>
<p>as mornings wrest you from sleep like a breech foal<br />
torn loose, shivering in the hay.</p>
