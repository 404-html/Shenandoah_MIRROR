								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m going to discuss a book you’ll never find in any bookstore, never see, never own. Its simple title, <em>Twenty-six Poems,</em> names the late flowering of a poet whose talent is deep, whose life has taken him to places and pursuits other than poetry and to whom life has now offered both a different choice and no choice at all:</p>
<blockquote><p>Already darkness<br />
Lies down among the laurels, the near hillside<br />
Plowed and planted<br />
In the green thrall of tobacco.<br />
Clouds off the Blue Ridge laden with rain<br />
Hang in the middle distance forever,<br />
A rim of light the demarcation<br />
Between mountains and sky.<br />
The air cools<br />
To a gathering radiance,<br />
Soon to be shadow, then limbo, then night.</p>
<p>&#8212; from “Already Darkness”</p></blockquote>
<p>The lines are lyric and cool. Like sea-smoothed stones in the hand, they calm, weighted with depth. William Keens is the poet, and I want you to meet him through his poems and the story of a long ago friendship. His work is elegant, rarely showy, restrained and daring. Moments like “the near hillside plowed and planted / in the green thrall of tobacco” flare to light the poem into memory, and though the quoted lines bring on the dark, they do so with a hymn’s quiet praise.</p>
<p>The poem “The Body Bends,” here in its entirety, engages us differently. Short lines alternate with longer ones to punctuate the dark wit the poem employs so well:</p>
<blockquote><p>THE BODY BENDS</p>
<p>The body bends<br />
To its demise, takes a bow<br />
Then retires<br />
With the cast that populates a life.</p>
<p>So much for planning. It doesn’t matter &#8212;<br />
Thug, friend or child molester,<br />
All lines<br />
Converge in babble at the end.</p>
<p>What’s true<br />
Shimmers like paradise through a keyhole.<br />
The old<br />
Stoop to it, stoop and stay doubled</p>
<p>With laughter<br />
Or the labor of starting over.</p></blockquote>
<p>Internal slant-rhymes “demise” and “retires” add power. “Life,” coming after with some irony, is a slant rhyme for both. In the second stanza, “friend” and “end” continue the irregular pattern, the first appearing between “thug” and “child molester,” equalizing all toward “end.” “All lines / converge in babble” the poet tells us, even as his lines direct us to more definite and delightful interpretation. Deepening into “What’s true” without specifying, the poem moves to the unseen view that “shimmers through a keyhole” toward which the old will bend to see. “Stoop” is repeated, slant rhyming with “true.” Whoever looks through this keyhole, whose revelation is like paradise, will stoop and “stay doubled” &#8212; and we can double that image as we will &#8212; “with laughter / or the labor of starting over.” Playful and sad but ultimately affirming, the poem compels re-reading, the slant rhymes of “laughter,” “labor” and “over” performing their own associate play. “The Body Bends,” like a number of other poems here, begins with a matter-of-fact darkness, then enlightens by confounding expectations. As does the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>END OF THE DAY</p>
<p>Cloud fields, cloud floes<br />
Great polar expanses<br />
Of iced air banked and layered beneath us<br />
From sunset to darkness as our plane beelines north.</p>
<p>Up here existence<br />
Is tenuous but light-hearted, at this hour<br />
Defined as a far room of color, cloud-radiant<br />
And night coming on.<br />
I could step out, try to walk<br />
If they’d hold me, the weightless ones</p>
<p>I loved in the past, still love and would gladly<br />
Embrace again their ethereal forms.<br />
Flight makes me think<br />
How dying will be &#8212; carried off over the ice pack.</p>
<p>The stars so brilliant,<br />
Numerous, indifferent, the light almost liquid,<br />
Trekkers and swimmers and silver transporters,<br />
The air full of us,<br />
More than anyone knew,</p>
<p>Each returning to a room<br />
Where the light is still on and someone &#8212; a figure<br />
Silhouetted in the window &#8212;<br />
Waits up in God-knows-what kind of mood.</p></blockquote>
<p>The last stanza’s tonal change is half anticipated, yet startling. “Up here existence / is tenuous but light-hearted” could serve as description of the whole poem. The ghosts the poet imagines peopling the air around him, “more than anyone knew,” are benign, beloved whoever they are, stranger or kin. The last stanza gives the poet and each ethereal form a trajectory toward the room where mystery is, and fear, and rueful laughter. The figure, metaphor for past, or Creator, or angel or kinsman, waiting up in “God-knows-what kind of mood” is like a parent, possibly furious, waiting for a tardy child. The line brings on a flinching smile. Like many here, this poem charms with a mixture of clarity and strangeness.</p>
<p>EVIDENCE OF ANGELS</p>
<p>Trying to divine<br />
Something sacred &#8212; what the long line<br />
Played out and reeled in<br />
Delivers silvery, wet and flopping<br />
Ungodlike<br />
But alive on the crescent of the beach.</p>
<p>Of course they disguise themselves &#8212;<br />
Fish with wings, weather vanes,<br />
High-flying hawks &#8212;<br />
Those “purely spiritual and<br />
Splendid beings”<br />
(This from an Islamic tract)<br />
Who row and spin in their interceding,</p>
<p>The sum a practical account:<br />
Crops grow,<br />
Tumors fade, children<br />
Remain whole, the thread doesn’t break.</p>
<p>Sublime, sublime<br />
The evidence of angels.<br />
For them, the bamboo<br />
Unfurls its shade, long poles that<br />
Sway and clack<br />
Like socketed pinions in the shimmering air.<br />
Otherwise</p>
<p>Murmurs in the crown,<br />
A sudden cooling like the advent of rain.</p>
<p>William Keens has faced, since the age of fifty-four, a diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease. Now sixty-two, he is still able to lead a full life. <em>Twenty-six Poems</em> was an unexpected gift from Bill when he came for a visit, after decades of no contact between us. You won’t see the book because it is privately printed in an edition of only one hundred copies for family and friends of the poet. The copy I hold in my hand is a beautiful object, its simple green cloth cover lovely to the touch. The hand-binding is evident, the design elegant, the paper handmade. Its power, however, as you have read, is in the strikingly rich material inside.</p>
<p>AFTER THE GREAT WAR</p>
<p>A train crosses the desert.</p>
<p>The shadow of a train<br />
Ripples like the negative image of wind<br />
Over a plain of lizards.<br />
We are their passing dream: bright metal</p>
<p>Of the dining car decked in clouds, the bone<br />
Face of my father.<br />
I brush salt from my palm<br />
And remember an outing with my family.</p>
<p>My grandmother rests in a dry light<br />
And talks of her labors<br />
The year Debs was in prison,<br />
Making flowers until her fingers bloomed like poppies.</p>
<p>I look from her outstretched hands<br />
Toward the others:<br />
My grandfather mowed down by sleep,<br />
Mother at her easel, father rowing into the wind.</p>
<p>So we were. Every day<br />
I searched for news of our armistice &#8212;<br />
Wind in the mesquite, wind looking for something &#8212;<br />
Every night redrafted the terms of our peace.</p>
<p>In “Names for the Heirloom,” which accents the naming that poetry is, the poet’s Italian grandmother sews in a high room in New York. Perhaps it is a quilt she is sewing, perhaps a coat, perhaps a dream or a song. Or all of these:</p>
<p>NAMES FOR THE HEIRLOOM</p>
<p>In the simple darkness of her kitchen, my nonna<br />
Stitches, stitches, stitches.<br />
Snips of thread and linen fall like snow into her lap.<br />
Her dress is black,<br />
Cut from the shirts of fascists, her hands<br />
Lie down like old companions,<br />
Two sisters in the winter olive grove sleeping</p>
<p>Or lovers or partisans. They travel among us:<br />
Two immigrants, two peasants, two voting socialists.<br />
We are the last known<br />
Ark of creation, sailing under threat of forgetfulness<br />
From that distant mooring, a kitchen in the dark<br />
As snow falls over West Fourth Street<br />
And I listen to my grandmother sew</p>
<p>Ever Near, Always With You,<br />
Something to wear in that storm.</p>
<p>Echoes of Neruda hover around this poem without upstaging the story. Again a strategy of slant rhyme animates the lines, with “kitchen” and the three “stitches” and “snips” working music into the beginning, music that shows up again as the poem moves into magic, the grandmother’s hands becoming two sisters, two compatriots, two lovers or partisans. The speaker and his grandmother are the “last known / Ark of creation” in the kitchen, floating in the dark, in the snow over New York’s West Fourth Street, and the immigrant’s heritage descending as the grandmother sews “Something to wear in that storm.”</p>
<p>Why write about a book that will never appear in a bookstore? And who is William Keens? I confess to reasons of both aesthetics and personal connection. And herein is a little history.</p>
<p>As the first Randall Jarrell Scholar at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Keens studied with Robert Watson and Fred Chappell. From there. he went on to the Iowa Writers Workshop to study with Donald Justice, Norman Dubie and Marvin Bell, graduating with a stellar class that included Tess Gallagher, David St. John, Michael Ryan, Denis Johnson and Laura Jensen, among others. Some of his work was published in journals, and there was a small chapbook from Penumbra Press in Iowa. There were years of hard work teaching English at an excellent and very old private high school in Raleigh, North Carolina. That’s where I met Bill, and therein lies our small adventure.</p>
<p>He was the most intense young man I ever met. Determined, driven, focused and very, very smart, he wanted everything &#8212; poetry, success, travel, love, beauty, art &#8212; the world. In the few years I knew him (can it have been thirty-five years since we met?), he was able to energize a group of us toward efforts we’d never imagined on our own. He talked me and another poet into starting &#8212; or trying to start &#8212; an honest-to-God serious literary journal. We loved gathering to talk poems and argue poetics, and somehow the idea of a journal grew. We could call it <em>Saxifrage</em> after the William Carlos Williams line and the flower said to split rock.</p>
<p>Against all odds, we &#8212; and this means mostly Bill &#8212; were able to raise enough money to publish the first issue with first-rate paper and art. And it was Bill who was able to get commitments for poems, essays and stories from some of the best writers around, including Dave Smith, Morris Dickstein and Elizabeth Sewell.</p>
<p>Bill also oversaw, with some help from us, getting the necessary tax-exempt status and the national distributor (DeBoer) we would need. Ours, we told ourselves, wouldn’t be just another literary magazine, but the best literary magazine ever! We were, after all, young.</p>
<p>Of course, our venture failed. Even before we could gather the first issue together, we came to see that with the longevity requirement for grants, the huge costs of production, the forty percent coming off the top for distribution and uncertain revenue from subscribers and advertisers for the foreseeable future, we’d have to raise large sums of money again and again. We knew we couldn’t swing it.</p>
<p>So we changed directions. Bill’s idea, of course. We decided to establish a literary prize: After contacting our donors and gaining their permission, we used the funds collected for the magazine to set up the Saxifrage Prize Competition. Open only to books published by university or small independent presses, the competition would award the Prize to poetry books and books of short fiction in alternating years. The winning author would receive $1,000 and would be brought to North Carolina for a three-city reading tour. The three copies of each book entered were donated, after the award year, to the public libraries of each of the cities hosting a reading. The entries poured in by the hundreds. The first winner was Robert Pinsky’s <em>An Explanation of America</em>, and the five finalists were equally as stunning. I arranged the Raleigh reading at the North Carolina Museum of Art, where Pinsky read among the Renaissance paintings, with a large crowd present.</p>
<p>The competition lasted five years, then the money ran out, and we were done. Bill had learned that he was very good indeed at working with people, at fund raising, designing plans and following through. He moved to Manhattan even before our competition ended, where he took a job editing <em>American Arts</em> magazine, the publication of the umbrella organization of American Arts Councils. Soon he was tapped to run the organization that published the magazine. Thereafter, he began a successful business of his own as a consultant to donors and grantees alike. With a happy second marriage that gave him and Caroline Watson two sons, Bill had fulfilled his ambitions, found meaningful work that rewarded him well: the yearned-for travel, a long-term connection with the arts and a full family life.</p>
<p>The diagnosis of Parkinson’s in 2002 changed Bill’s life, of course. His consulting business pared down, his perspective on the future was altered and he gained an expanded sense of the value of every day and reclaimed his art. He had already begun writing poetry after a hiatus of decades, and that call became stronger. In the four-part poem “Covenant of Circles” the following lines are addressed to poetry itself, to the muse if you will:</p>
<p>My poor half-sister streams through the window.<br />
She is the morning light, I labor<br />
In the hem of her dress<br />
Trying to sew a fold in the radiance</p>
<p>And fail again. But hold in my hand<br />
The light body that breaks into flame<br />
Like tongues into canticles. . . .</p>
<p>The poem moves then from Madame Curie to Einstein, from Copernicus to Galileo, its line limning circles, hymns to light and galaxies, to “the Zodiac’s fish-filled, goat-raucous band,” and to “All who rode into the shadows and never came out again; / Shed fire, sang, burned with fever.” It&#8217;s a risky, brilliant poem.</p>
<p>These slower days, and occasionally using a cane to maintain his balance, Bill works with a few select clients as a consultant, visits Italy to be with relatives on his mother&#8217;s side, with whom he has established ties, spends time with Caroline and his boys, and writes.  He has also founded a website with his colleague Brian Lemond of Brooklyn Digital Foundry.  <em>The Poetry Ark</em> is a sort of interactive salon for poetry lovers and has culminated in <em>The Ark Anthology</em>, one hundred poems voted on by users, downloadable at www.poetryark.com</p>
<p>One of the most moving and interesting among the <em>Twenty-Six Poems</em> is this one:</p>
<p>Inversion</p>
<p>Root trunk and branch<br />
Root trunk and branch</p>
<p>Outspread up-ended<br />
Root could be crown being<br />
Source and mooring<br />
In wind gale and tempest<br />
Wind gale and tempest</p>
<p>Blows the errant seagull inland<br />
Wheatfield mystery of that oracular bird</p>
<p>Just so the displaced unexpected<br />
Rogue cell misfiring neuron<br />
Age that narrow constrains constricts<br />
Blood&#8217;s course heart&#8217;s errant tick<br />
Until</p>
<p>Breathless battered sapped<br />
Looking down looks up into that starry net</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written here about a book both present and unavailable, and I&#8217;ve done so to make it, at least in part, present for those who read this.  I&#8217;ve written not out of a long ago friendship, but because the poems are original, beautiful, strange, deeply sad, deeply celebratory, and necessary to their author in ways that make them necessary for the reader who finds them.  I have written here because the making of poems, the thing itself (&#8220;the light that body breaks into flame like tongues into canticles&#8221;), matters so much more than <em>careers</em> in poetry &#8212; in teaching or performance or publishing &#8212; and because some poets write in the dark and thereby write themselves out of darkness into light.  All the candles matter, however windblown, when the gift is there, when the flame is a true one.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since birth, I have endured the Scotch-Irish curse of spots. By this I mean freckles, freckles everywhere—face, chest, back, arms and legs. At a swimming pool in Atlanta, during my high school years, a Yankee gaped at the quarter-sized freckles on my shirtless torso and shouted, “Hey, kid, what’s wrong? You got leprosy or something?” Scattered among the freckles there are also a few nevi, also called “moles”—those pigmented bumps that afflict most of the human race.</p>
<p>My spot-related anxieties first came upon me during a lecture in medical school, when I saw the photograph of a ragged black spot on a patient’s thigh. An X-ray showed his lungs filled with malignant nodules the size of golf balls. The man had a melanoma, an insidious skin cancer that can resemble a nevus during its early stages. My God, I thought—that could be me! I raced to the surgery clinic, where a resident agreed that a nevus on my chest had a worrisome pearly border. I still bear the scar of its almost instant excision. To my immense relief, pathologic examination showed no sign of malignancy.</p>
<p>My anxieties lay dormant for three years, until I examined a young law student who had dark nodules scattered beneath his skin, nodules that had spread from a melanoma on his scrotum. The poor victim was my age, almost to the day, and in the rush of an instant, this dreadful coincidence set my old obsession aflame.</p>
<p>I tried to calm myself with reason—this was nothing, just a foolish anxiety like all those that had gone before—but a terrifying truth kept fighting its way through my defenses: six of my spots are on a place where half the human race doesn’t even have a place. Not on the scrotum, like the malignant lesion that had spread through the law student’s bloodstream, but damn close. Five of these spots look like innocent freckles, while the sixth shows, by a slight elevation above the surface of my skin, the features of a nevus. But was it really a nevus, or was it… could it be… a melanoma?</p>
<p>The moment the doomed patient left my exam room, I took an early lunch break, then rushed, sweaty and tremulous, to the dermatology clinic. Here Doctor Gantry, the chief resident, listened to my story and examined me carefully, peering through a magnifying lens held inches from the organ under study. He was a good man. His deep, soothing voice calmed me down. He assured me this was not a crisis, since the lesion causing me so much distress was almost certainly benign, though there might be some risk &#8212;  very small —but one that had to be considered, since on rare occasions a melanoma can arise from what appears to be a benign nevus. He would consult his colleagues.</p>
<p>The word “colleagues” disturbed me.   With how many doctors would he share the story of my worrisome spot? Soon after he left the exam room, I heard a murmur of voices, zipped my fly shut and cracked the door, only to discover a squadron of white coats gathered in the hallway. It seemed that every student and resident and faculty member in the whole department had gathered for an avid discussion. Surely, God forbid, this wasn’t all about me?</p>
<p>It was. At last the gentle Doctor Gantry entered the exam room with a female colleague in tow. He closed the door, then explained that, after some debate, two schools of thought had emerged concerning the management of my problem. One school—the more conservative, to which he belonged—advocated a policy of live and let live: keep an eye on the worrisome nevus, and if anything changed, then a biopsy would be in order (by <a href="http://www.dresshead.com/dresshead-staff-profile-joann-whiteside" style="text-decoration: none;color: #333">whiteside</a> at <a href="http://www.dresshead.com" style="text-decoration: none;color: #333">http://www.dresshead.com</a>). From this debate, however, there had also arisen a more aggressive approach, one advocated by Doctor Taylor, the sturdy, dark-haired woman standing impatiently by his side.</p>
<p>To this day I remember her first words to me.  Not &#8220;Glad to meet you,&#8221; or &#8220;How are you today,&#8221; but “Ok, let’s see it.”  Yet more disturbing were the words that came after Exhibit A had been hauled out and inspected with a magnifying glass. “Ah, no question—they’ve <em>all</em> got to come off!”</p>
<p>“All!” I spluttered. “But those… those others… the five, except for this one… those…surely… they’re just freckles.”</p>
<p>“Freckles!” she said with a derisive snort. “To get freckles, you’ve got to have sunlight, and I don’t think… you tell me—have you…?”</p>
<p>No, I confessed, my precious parts had yet to see the full light of the noonday sun. But surely, I argued, all six spots looked benign. Couldn’t we just wait and see, do a biopsy if there was any change?</p>
<p>“Sure we could wait,” Doctor Taylor said. “But if the pathologist found malignant cells, to be sure he got all the tumor, the surgeon would have to go back and excise several cubic centimeters of adjacent tissue. An alarming prospect, wouldn’t you say, given the, uh, body part involved?”</p>
<p>Alarming indeed. My legs trembled so badly I could hardly stand. After she left, Gantry told me to sit down and stepped from the room to bring me a cup of water. There was no rush.  No reason to panic.  His voice droned on and on, so gentle and reassuring I expected him to pat me on the head. In any case, he said, I needed to see a plastic surgeon, the specialist best qualified to perform such a delicate procedure.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The next morning, I skipped a lecture and made my way down to plastic surgery clinic, where the receptionist, a tiny blonde woman, got things off to a bad start by asking the fatal question:  “What’s the nature of your problem?”</p>
<p>“Well, uh… I… uh… .” I said. After an awkward silence, “Let me wait… I’ll tell the doctor myself.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, sir,” she said, “but we need this information so the nurse can prepare you for the doctor’s exam.”</p>
<p>“Oh, God,” I said, then covered my mouth with my hand. We stared at each other. She held her pen poised over a clipboard, eager to record the nature of a problem that seemed so bizarre it would surely evoke fits of helpless laughter. I imagined the receptionist rushing about the clinic to share my riotous story with every female in sight, or leaning toward me across the counter, her eyes wide in disbelief, shouting, “Noooooooo, you’ve got to be kidding!”</p>
<p>“Look,” I said at last, “you’ll just have to take my word for it. I don’t need a nurse to help me show my problem to the doctor. I can do it all by myself, and it won’t take a second. Trust me, please…”</p>
<p>“Well…” she said, giving me the look one might give a stubborn child. “Ok, if you insist.”</p>
<p>Relieved for the moment, chart in hand, I was led down a corridor to a cubicle that contained a sink, an examination table, and a small metal stool. When the door closed behind me, I unbuttoned my shirt, ripped two paper towels out of the dispenser above the sink and tucked them into my sopping armpits. I sat on the stool for what seemed like an hour, listening to occasional footsteps and muffled voices in the hallway. At last, a brief knock announced the arrival of my savior.</p>
<p>It was Doctor O’Riley, the chief resident in plastic surgery, a squat Irishman with a cheerful lilt to his voice. The instant he stepped through the door, I gave a sigh of relief. He had red hair and pale skin. A constellation of reddish brown freckles spread across his nose and down his cheeks. Three darker spots—nevi, no doubt—were clustered on the lower lid of one eye. I  also recognized an irregular, yellow-brown conjunctival nevus on the white of that eye. Here was a fellow who could sympathize with my plight.</p>
<p>When I told him about Doctor Taylor’s dogged insistence that I submit my organ for multiple biopsies, O’Riely scowled.</p>
<p>“Damn that woman,” he said, “she’s at it again!”  Apparently Taylor had referred other terrified males for surgical extraction of spots from their delicate parts. O’Riley explained the hazard of her whack-‘em-all-off approach—bands of residual scar that might cause ripping pain when put under the tension of an erection. Moreover, a surgeon would have to excise thousands of benign nevi before he discovered one melanoma.</p>
<p>“Okay,” O&#8217;Riely said at last, “let’s take a look.”  When I unzipped my fly to expose myself for microscopic examination, he exclaimed, “Only six lesions!” Hell, I’ve got more than that. Don’t worry about the damn things. Come back if you notice any change. By the way, I think you’re right—those other five lesions are most likely freckles. And leave that little nevus alone. It isn’t nearly as dangerous as a drive down the Bay Shore Freeway.”</p>
<p>“Thanks… thanks a lot,” I said. “I can’t tell you…”</p>
<p>That was the truth—I couldn’t tell him. The lump in my throat made it hard to speak. I left the clinic in a rush, lest my spotted Irish savior see the tears of gratitude gathering in my eyes.  Worse yet, had I stayed around another moment, I might have lost all, thrown my arms around the poor man and kissed him on a rosy cheek.</p>
<p>My spots have behaved themselves for four decades.  In return, I have spared them the scrutiny of yet another microscopic inspection.  And unlike many of Dr. Taylor&#8217;s victims, I don&#8217;t double over in pain every time temptation comes my way.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My knees recall a watery buckle whenever I remember my encounters with snakes, their undulations across my path, their many permutations. Once, in early summer I nearly stumbled upon an adolescent copperhead a foot long and as big around as a dime. It had moved into my storage shed, following the food chain. When I saw it, I did something without thinking.</p>
<p>LAST WEEK I was out spit-shining the country property because it’s on the market. Picking up the last remnants of shriveled oak leaves wedged between the heat pump and the house, I had one of those very human moments when you find yourself alone surrounded by nature. There’s a certain stillness I’ve come to recognize that means you are being watched. The human is object not subject; the gaze of nature turns back, or the silence of nature is held in suspense as you stumble into it. Late autumn chilled the air, and just past my left foot a young copperhead lazed on a warm orangey-brown slab of flagstone, perfect cover for the snake, as rock and snake share the same mottled color. The snake’s head tensed up, sensing in my direction. I glanced to check its pupils and confirmed that they were elliptical like a cat’s. There was no mistaking this narrow fellow for a<br />
nonpoisonous variety.</p>
<p>The copperhead was very near, but I worked my way around it without scaring it off. Stealthy in my motions, I dashed inside for my chef’s knife, afraid the snake might slither too far off if I trekked all the way to the shed for a hoe. The knife was one of those heavy cleaver jobs best wielded by professional cooks that amateurs keep in their kitchens for inspiration. My chef’s knife had come with a German-honed set, and so far I’d only used the paring knife.</p>
<p>Leaving out the details, I used the big chopper on the copperhead, knowing they usually travel in pairs and hoping this one was still young enough to be dating around, but old enough to have wandered far from its nest. Seeing it so close to the foundation gave me a shiver. I wasn’t certain where it had nested.</p>
<p>I wish I could say that I regret having done it, but the last thing I need is some potential buyer getting spooked as he walks up the stairs to the back deck. I genuinely hate that I killed it without even a nod to the big picture of the life cycle of all of us creatures here below, but I have to accept that I prefer the snake’s death to the possible theft of a customer. This is probably a good sign that it really is time for me to leave country living behind. When I first moved from the suburbs, I was not capable of killing a mouse, let alone a snake. I carried all ladybugs and stinkbugs outside, leaving the spiders be and puzzling over the ants, large and small. Clearly, country living has not been the constant pastoral, the peaceable kingdom I once imagined. And I’m not necessarily more peace loving for having experienced its conditions. The first thing I saw when I moved to the country was a bunch of slaughtered hogs hanging on big hooks at the side of a barn. My new neighbors smiled and waved as I drove by.</p>
<p>THE DICTIONARY PROVIDES that our North American copperhead appears after Copernicus and before its capitalized variation. Copperhead was a derisive appellation applied to anti-Lincoln “Peace Democrats,” northerners sympathetic to the South during the Civil War. The Knights of the Golden Circle was a Copperhead secret society. It’s a term I&#8217;d never heard until I consulted Webster’s to begin my elementary education beyond what practical experience had already taught me about a certain serpent: copperheads live in rocky areas and favor thick underbrush; they eat small warm-blooded mammals for the most part, but will eat aquatic life and insects if pressed. How small were those mammals? I wondered. Most active in late afternoon and early evening, copperheads can grow to four feet in length, but average two. I cling to averages. That last fact bothered me a good deal.</p>
<p>Now we hear that snakes originally walked around on numerous feet, that there was no slither to the snake primeval. Snake derives from what it means to crawl. I can&#8217;t help but picture snakes on all fours scuttling across the floor. It gives me a funny image of the fall of man in the Garden of Eden. Was it more like a centipede that tempted Eve? Not much of story. I prefer my dog or cat, familiar mammals with furry paws.</p>
<p>The coloration of copperheads approaches hazel with chestnut brown markings. Bands taper across their spines like saddlebags or the hourglass. Shadows speckle their pinkish to white underbellies, and, yes, they do sport blunt-nosed copper-colored heads that taper like arrows on narrow necks. Aside from their slit eyes, the arrow shape of the head also means poison.</p>
<p>The rubbery oblong eggs I found in the rock pile along the drive were those of the black snake, famous for climbing trees. I’ve watched one wrap my nearest jack oak, spiraling gradually toward a nest to filch eggs or baby birds. A few times I tried to unwrap it from the trunk on its way up and managed to toss it into the brush with my walking stick, but the black snake always came right back, persistently after chirps in the high tree branches. I knew black snakes were good for eating rodents and for keeping away the poisonous snakes, so I didn’t disturb the eggs I found sprinkled in the rocks.</p>
<p>Copperheads are born live and emerge from a viscous pool of something akin to the primordial soup. I’ve seen copperhead afterbirth shimmering with alien hieroglyphics, black words scribbled in eight-inch snakes at the center of the goo. Until I saw this, I thought they came out of eggs.</p>
<p>ONLY AFTER I tossed my shed intruder by its tail out of reflex with one garden-gloved hand did I learn another salient fact, or maybe two: 1) I had done something foolish, and 2) As we sat around a table deep into dinner conversation much later in the summer, one of my companions reported that her husband had discovered a young copperhead in their house and been advised by the county extension agent to swiftly kill it, because the babies come equipped with a more lethal supply of venom than their parents.</p>
<p>Venom means the snakes’ survival and ignorance of it perhaps my death. I downed some more wine as I considered my luck at not having been bitten. My foolish left hand quivered in my lap with my napkin. I had twirled that little sucker from under my feet without a second&#8217;s hesitation. This is probably what ultimately led me to chop the autumnal copperhead in two with the chef’s knife several years later. I’m not really out for nature’s blood. I believe in karma and try not to create the bad sort. I know enough to stop and think about what goes around.</p>
<p>After having flung it far from me with one hand, I found my little copperhead the following day, edging a kindling box in the very same shed, perched with head up sensing the air when I disturbed its lair for my garden tools. I determined then to reorganize the kindling, to destroy the snake&#8217;s habitat or hunting ground instead of the snake. I spent the better part of a steamy summer afternoon dumping boxes of wood into a plastic garbage can I situated behind the shed and firmly lidded. Something I&#8217;ve learned by experience is how attractive copperheads find wood, especially stacked lumber or firewood where mice nest. Everyone loves to hang out in the kitchen.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve not seen that very snake since, but I do not fail to give a stomp on the shed floor before grabbing or replacing a tool. I peer up into the rafters, even though I&#8217;ve heard that copperheads do not climb, because I&#8217;ve seen them sunning atop lumber piles, and I doubt they make fine distinctions.</p>
<p>“WELL, WELL!” CONCLUDED Max O’Rell, upon discovering that the snake he thought he was in bed with, in a rural town in Australia, was really his trusted walking stick: “Is it possible for a man to be such a fool!” (“My First Snake,” <em>The Ladies’ Home Journal</em>, 1894). Since our very first encounter, copperheads have had a tendency to make me look and feel stupid. As a consequence, I do not trust them to behave as they should. Before I entered first grade, I could tell a snake from a worm and had seen a copperhead wriggling along the floor of our foyer. It confounded me, but not because I did not recognize it for what it was. My own reptile brain was hard wired for recoil even though I could not correctly pronounce its name. I was left with another mumbled word that was almost as unwieldy in my mouth, since I had trouble with W&#8217;s, too. After running outside, I announced to my mother, who was busy sunbathing, as people in the sixties felt justified in doing, that there was &#8220;a big worm&#8221; in the house. She urged me to just pick it up and throw it out the door.</p>
<p>I was not a squeamish child, but luckily my instincts – better then than now – did not allow me to follow her instruction. Instead, I bravely called my older sister out of her sacred room, away from her oil painting and teenage rumination, but by then the snake, or &#8220;nake,&#8221; as I called it, had fled. Despite the amusement that usually followed my struggles with pronunciation, I told my sister about the snake in my own language, but that only made me look like an idiot or a liar. Where was it now? And I was scared, too, because unlike my mother and sister, I knew what I had seen had been no simple worm, and I vigilantly kept watch for the viper to turn up under someone&#8217;s feet. For weeks I checked my shoes before I tied them on.</p>
<p>I WAS CLOSER with my &#8220;worm&#8221; than I knew at the time, at least closer to Norse legends of the Midgard-Worm that girds the earth, its tail in its mouth, endlessly cycling through the yin-yang of oppositions. I think it was a long time before I saw another copperhead, with only harmless black snakes and their lost skins in between. Those freshly sloughed sheaths – glimmering on the grass, drying out on stone patios, lying decorously in flowerbeds or carried down the attic stairs of my new house over the shoulder of the home inspector – have never failed to attract and hold my attention. Some of those shed skins have been intact and very long, like giant transparent bean pods the texture of cellophane, something like a mask waiting for a dancer to peer back through its vacant eye-holes. You could pour the snake back in to fill its old skin, I think. But, of course, you cannot. No more than you can turn back time.</p>
<p>Last summer I found a dead black snake tangled in the plastic netting of my pond, its skin split where it tried to force itself backward to escape. Seeing inside the peeled snake filled me with guilt. The netting I had laid to protect the fish from raccoons, and tortoises from falling into the water and drowning, had caught and held the snake fast. There are obviously greater forces at work than our individual intentions, good or bad.</p>
<p>The backward push of the snake in its panic reminds me of a recurring nightmare I had for years, in which I had to drive a speeding car with my view restricted to the rearview mirror. I had to try to anticipate what lay ahead from what was just behind. Twists and hair-raising turns lay ahead, to which I was blind. It makes my stomach tense just to write this down. Eventually I’d wake up, wrecking the car.</p>
<p>“Don’t look back,” said Satchel Page.  “Something might be gaining on you.”</p>
<p>Indeed. And there is nothing back there that’s going to help you guess where this road goes next.</p>
<p>I&#8217;VE HEARD ABOUT black snakes that share living space with human households, plopping in a polite way onto cool, kitchen linoleum after everyone has gone to bed. A friend of mine who rented a renovated log cabin had an infestation of black snakes in her walls that started in her underwear drawer. It was rather a long story that made her shiver to tell, which eventually led to a thousand dollars of damage to her truck when she moved out of her cabin in the middle of the night in a thunderstorm as snakes slithered from the walls and ceiling.</p>
<p>According to the Gnostics, we&#8217;ve snakes to thank for wresting knowledge from the gods. But if I am to restrict the limits of my life story in snakes to first-hand accounts, I have only a few snakes left to tell about, aside from the six-foot timber rattler that buzzed across a hiking trail (no real story there); the several black snakes I’ve already mentioned that I unwrapped from summer tree limbs with my walking stick and tossed out of range to protect wren and barn swallow nests; the many black snake lodgers in the giant oak, inside its rotten trunk and among its gnarled roots, at the camp where I go each summer to teach; and certain others worth only short reports, encountered with mere glimpses, stepped over and forgotten. The sight of a black snake climbing up the wall of your house can do wonders for adrenaline, but it’s probably not going to bite you unless you tangle with it, and even then you won’t die.</p>
<p>WHEN I SAW a copperhead in my rental house west of Lexington, Virginia, I had no doubt about its identification, although I duly described the color and markings over the phone to my Indiana Jones-type friend in an attempt at denial.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep, you&#8217;ve got yourself a full-grown copperhead,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I can get there in an hour or so. Just leave it alone and shut off the room.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like I was going to stand there and poke it with a stick. I did what he suggested, but I had to reenter my bedroom to dress.</p>
<p>In the early 1990’s I was living in a renovated granary. I&#8217;d been outside taking a shower, the inaugural outdoor shower of the year, on an unusually warm Mother&#8217;s Day afternoon. I&#8217;d come back into the bedroom and had seen something stir in the closet. All I saw at first was motion. I&#8217;m nearsighted and had left my glasses on the dresser before padding outside. I donned them, still wearing nothing but a towel, and the snake came into focus out of the dimness. There was no door on the closet, just a rod where I&#8217;d not hung a curtain. The copperhead was coiled, head up at the ready, imitating every image of a giant cobra I’d ever seen. I guess it had sensed my approach and was poised to defend its claim on the great indoors. I was its swami, my wet head wrapped in a towel. It looked large, thicker than the lower part of my arm just above the wrist. Before I called my Indiana Jones, who lived near Charlottesville, I had called everyone I knew in town but had gotten only one answering machine after another. I figured everyone was out having dinner with their mothers, while I was caught here with a snake. On some level, I suppose it served me right. Oh, Swami.</p>
<p>I rattled a few drawers looking for clothes, trying all the while to keep an eye on the viper. It slowly changed position, and I went to the closet to investigate in time to see it glide behind a stack of shoeboxes. True to form, it was just trying to escape.</p>
<p>I was glad it proved shy, but I was disgusted, too. “Great,” I thought, “after my Indiana Jones drives an hour to rescue me, the damn snake will be gone.” The least it could do after making me feel so vulnerable was to stick around long enough to validate my story.</p>
<p>I closed the bedroom door to be safe, but I didn&#8217;t expect my visitor to return. The snake had no stake in my credibility. It wouldn’t be the first or last time a snake made a fool out of me. I amused myself by imagining the copperhead coiled over my flip-flops or pumps. After all, it had shown an interest in my shoes.</p>
<p>Sleuthing for a slithery trail, I rounded the barn that was my house and found an array of loose boards stacked against the closet’s exterior wall. Soon I located what I thought was the copperhead’s entry point, a gap in the foundation near the ground.</p>
<p>While I awaited my rescuer, I made a quick trip to the grocery store for steaks. I wasn&#8217;t going to drag my friend all this way over a mountain for nothing. The least I could do was throw something worthwhile on the grill.</p>
<p>Indiana pulled up in his truck equipped with a hoe, some bludgeoning logs and his wild animal scat book. We started our safari in the closet. He pulled out my shoeboxes and uncovered the offending hole.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stuff some steel wool in that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As I gave him the inside tour of everywhere the snake had been, I strategically mentioned the steaks. Then I led him around to the side of the house, where I&#8217;d circled several times already, nosing around the lumber pile and searching for more entry points.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t move,&#8221; Indiana said. &#8220;Just back out slowly.&#8221;</p>
<p>I backed out and stopped about ten feet from the stacked lumber, hunched over and focused on the ground. Then I threw my glance toward the wood. Shoulder high, or where my head had bowed but a moment before, sprawled the copperhead, all three feet of it. Forget averages. My stomach lurched as I counted the number of times I&#8217;d stood exactly on or near that spot in the last hour and a half. Yes, if it had been a snake . . . . Indiana informed me that unlike other snakes copperheads give no warning before striking. They hold their ground and lunge if cornered, but generally inject less venom than other poisonous varieties that give warning gestures.</p>
<p>I was breathing hard when I asked, &#8220;What do you think we should do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Indiana didn’t hesitate. “Kill it. It knows its way inside now, and it&#8217;ll keep hanging around.”</p>
<p>I must have looked distressed or afraid.</p>
<p>“They mate, you know. Why don&#8217;t you start the charcoal,” he added with sympathy.</p>
<p>I did as I was told and never asked where he pitched the dead snake. He did say it was as tough as old shoe leather and hard to kill. I told everyone about his chivalry and derring-do. I kept thinking about Bruce Dern, though, in the film &#8220;Tattoo,&#8221; with his skin so completely obscured by patterns and designs that he ended up evoking a reptile. But my Indiana was just a regular, transplanted Yankee, with a penchant for trail wear, leather bomber jackets and nature writing.</p>
<p>UNFORTUNATELY, INDIANA WASN’T the only gentleman I had to recruit to kill a copperhead while I was living in that barn. Instead of being a genuine nature lover, the next one was enrolled at the university&#8217;s law school. I think I would have fared better with a medical student, who would at least have had an affinity for the caduceus. This law student had nothing more in mind than a few lazy weeks of R&amp;R house-sitting at the Big Farm House, not engaging in jungle warfare at the converted barn below. Law students and lawyers, in my experience, are generally tired or nervous most of the time. All of that left-brainiac stuff of building arguments out of human nature makes them fall into a light coma the minute they sit down.</p>
<p>On a Sunday evening in hot July, I was sitting on the stairs that led down to my kitchen, sweating, with my portable phone pressed to my ear, chatting away long distance when I happened to gaze toward the stove. At first I wasn&#8217;t sure what had caught my attention, but a few seconds later I saw a vibrating tongue and then a head emerge at floor level. No mistaking the slit eyes, the anvil head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Copperhead!&#8221; I announced, into the phone.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a copperhead under my stove.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re shitting me,&#8221; my city friend said.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I gotta go,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Damn, it just disappeared.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the previous long winter months, I’d caught all manner of rodents – brown field mice with white feet, grey, smaller-eared house mice, and chubby, stubby-tailed, squint-eyed voles. I started by catching them in Havahart traps. Catch and release. But that sentiment didn’t last through November.</p>
<p>After clearing out all the items from the cabinet beside the stove, I lined it with various death-dealing devices. Over glue traps or poison, I favored the old-fashioned snap traps that worked as swiftly as the gallows. I&#8217;d caught such a succession of mice and variations of mice under the kitchen counter that I&#8217;d pasted a picture of Mickey Mouse inside one of the doors, circled and canceled through with black marker. I had been practicing with small things, it’s true, but I still wasn’t ready to kill a snake.</p>
<p>I eased open the door to my &#8220;The Cabinet of Doom&#8221; and peered inside, but I did not find the snake. The way the cabinet ran the length of the kitchen and the kitchen connected to the bathroom just beyond, the snake could have been anywhere. I know this must be hard to picture, but remodeling a granary into living space necessarily leaves some gaps of convenience, some loopholes through which civilization and the wild can still slip in an exchange of sorts, back and forth. I would have preferred a pest-free living space, but the granary had its share of charms. I moved in with a sense of adventure. My cat had the same idea and vanished through a hole behind the water heater on our first afternoon in the place. When I stopped panicking and calling everyone I knew, I saw her, the consummate tuxedoed house cat, strutting down the driveway from the big house. I promptly called my landlady, who plugged the hole. Life had been proceeding in this fashion ever since, presenting hole after hole to be patched. I&#8217;d even seen it snow right through the wall.</p>
<p>I remembered something my Indiana had said after he killed the Mother&#8217;s Day Special. &#8220;They follow the plumbing when they&#8217;re thirsty.” I did say it was a very hot July.</p>
<p>I gathered up my cat, remembering the &#8220;copperheads don&#8217;t climb&#8221; lore, and situated her with her litter box in the loft where I also planned to retreat. It was almost dusk, and I didn&#8217;t know what else to do. I waited, turning pages of a book. Just before ten, I heard a car crunching up the gravel drive and ran out to flag it down. It was the law student house sitter, heading up to the main house after downing a few at a local watering hole. I told him about the snake and didn&#8217;t stop chattering until he offered to come in and look around. Did I say he was reluctant?</p>
<p>&#8220;It could be anywhere by now,&#8221; the law student said hopefully. &#8220;Probably went back outside.&#8221; He suppressed a yawn.</p>
<p>But it hadn&#8217;t. We soon found it pressed up against the back door of the tub and laundry room. At first, I was in favor of just opening the door, but I remembered what Indiana had advised about the other one. This was probably its mate, but perhaps not. There was no way to be sure.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want to do?&#8221; the law student asked, backing away.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t blame him; my knees were water and my stomach felt like I&#8217;d just eaten a bushel of grass. &#8220;Death Valley Days&#8221; flashed through my mind, episodes that inevitably featured a bandanna tourniquet at some crucial point in the narrative, a knife slicing thigh or arm flesh and our hero sucking and spitting out rattlesnake venom to save a bad man&#8217;s life. Forget about anti-venom.</p>
<p>This was my home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kill it,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But how?&#8221; the law student asked, now with more interest in the project.</p>
<p>&#8220;With a hoe or something?&#8221; I hadn&#8217;t actually witnessed the other snake&#8217;s execution, so I was guessing here. Didn’t Farmer McGregor always swing a hoe after the rabbits?</p>
<p>“I’ve never killed anything before,” my reluctant hero said, and then qualified his statement. “Deliberately, I mean.”</p>
<p>“Me, neither,” I echoed. I guess I had already discounted the mice. I was the butcher of mice among women, yet I didn’t stop to count them. I was already gone, I suppose.</p>
<p>If it had been anything else, I would have stepped in at this point and volunteered, cheerfully relegating the law student to moral support. As a child I was read to incessantly from two books, <em>The Little Engine That Could</em> and <em>The Little Red Hen</em>. From these wise sources I’ve gleaned my personal philosophy of &#8220;I think I can do it myself.&#8221; And most of the time, it works well enough. I can use a wrench, a drill and two kinds of screw drivers, truss a turkey, make a decent cherry pie from scratch, replace the inner workings of a toilet, shop for a car without male support, and I once drove a stick shift on little notice as my high school date puked Boone’s Farm Burgundy out the window, but I was not doing this.</p>
<p>Where was my nature writer-Indiana Jones or the Hell’s Angel-turned-zoologist I later met, who had a dragon tattooed in his palm? The zoologist studied snake vocalizations by dissecting their throats. True. He was allergic to anti-venom and King Cobras were his research subjects, but I’m positive he’d have had no qualms about killing this snake. For that matter, where was my Lady of the Lands, who had so skillfully, if unmercifully, used a cool poker to clobber a rat that had refused to die in one of my attic traps?</p>
<p>Gentle reader, she was in France. I would have to make of this law student the one I required.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you can handle it,&#8221; I said, as if dropping a file onto his desk at 5 p.m., offering him a preview of corporate law practice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go get something,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t expect him to return. I doubt I would have. Someone had whispered to me earlier that summer that she thought the law student was gay, as though I cared. Now, I desperately wanted him to go against whatever remained of that tired typecasting. To his credit, he came back down to the granary toting a hoe, an ax and an orange snow shovel. They turned out to be good choices.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you’d better do it fast,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>He did it slowly, and the snake bunched up like a bulging biceps every time he tried to saw it with the dull ax blade. Eventually he managed to divide the copperhead into two stubborn halves while I held down its head with the hoe.</p>
<p>He carried it out the door in the shovel, one half after the other, apologizing for the iridescent mess of scales and pungent blood saturating the indoor-outdoor carpeting.</p>
<p>I just thanked him profusely, and after he&#8217;d gone, repeatedly scrubbed at the metallic blood. I swept up scores of glittering scales that adhered to my hands. It seemed I could not erase the stain with detergent and water, or even Boraxo powdered hand soap. Only time would wear the shimmer from my skin, and it never entirely left the blue carpet.</p>
<p>I KNOW MY snake story, like the World Serpent&#8217;s endless circling, has no end, that my encounters will continue until I receive the message, but what’s with these snakes? To live in harmony seems unlikely after so much blood and fear, avoidance and confrontation. If snakes are following me, I have to wonder why.</p>
<p>Today, I take a break from writing and walk outside to see how Ron’s doing with the rockwork on the pond below the waterfall. I want it all finished before the open house. Although he’s a large man, a professional greens-man for the movies and as practiced as a Druid with rock moving, I’m a little worried he’s handling too much alone. Virginia bluestone is much heavier than it looks; it’s very dense stone. I remember that each of the eighty Stonehenge bluestones weighs up to four tons and probably had to travel 240 miles from Preseli Hills in Wales. It’s enough to make you believe in aliens.</p>
<p>I’m trying to forget about snakes, about words and mysteries, when Ron says, “I’m sorry, but I killed a little snake in the pond. I didn’t mean to, but I flicked it when I saw it. Reflex.” Ron tells me it was a Queen Snake. Not poisonous at all. He pulls back a fold of rubber pond liner, and I see it, bright green and still writhing. Ron tucks back the liner. “I’ll get it later,” he says.</p>
<p>SNAKE MEDICINE IS potent, linking us back through every culture to the first shamans, snake charmers and holy women, alternately despised and worshipped. Perhaps I need to take a dream-time break and retreat, as the ancient Greeks did to their dream temples decorated with undulating snakes, guardians of sleep and healing. Maybe I need to consult an oracle.</p>
<p>My spoken language is tightly tied to the snake by my first encounter in the foyer of my childhood, when to speak its name through the shame of my imperfect speech meant the difference between complete and faulty communication, perhaps life and death. I didn’t yet trust that speaking the truth requires passion, not perfection. There are still a lot of things left to learn and certain mysteries to ponder: like why speaking the truth can so often lead to ridicule or silencing, even when the words are all pronounced correctly.</p>
<p>IN THE COUNTRY house I bought after living in the granary, I found another baby copperhead in my foyer late one spring. I almost stepped on it, and surprisingly, my ailing, elderly cat just avoided it, if she sensed or saw it at all. Even my dog let it alone, neither cat nor dog alerting me to the intruder. Again, it was a woodpile that attracted the invader: split logs stacked conveniently next to the door. Sometimes I learn things only after constant repetition. Would I ever, finally learn? I have let snakes go, aided in their deaths, and now I have killed them myself, but in every case they return, loop back, with another variation, another chance for me to gain some ground, some wisdom. Maybe this story has no resolution. I know it has no simple moral. Maybe my hair’s made of hissing snakes, and I’m the only one who can’t see it. Don’t look.</p>
<p>I swept that copperhead out the door, and gave it a good long toss off the shovel over the fence. This time, at least, I cast out the snake with a shovel, not my hand. Incremental progress, but progress nonetheless. The next few hours I spent in long sleeves, poking through the woodpile and gingerly removing each log until the steel frame cord holder was empty. I dragged the frame far from the house before restacking the logs. Then I ordered a new sliding door. There was a gap in the old one. I could have filled it with caulk, but I was into renovations in a big way back then, trying to achieve something that was all mine by rebuilding my little house one piece at a time. I had started with new hardwood floors before moving in and gone from there, replacing the faulty stove pipe that had a disintegrated liner, then the woodstove itself, graduating from a smoky appliance to one with a catalytic converter to save the environment. I replaced the kitchen appliances with ENERGY STAR brands, added a heat pump and a back-up furnace. Forty-year architectural shingles covered the roof, and the overhead light fixtures were all upgraded with ceiling fan kits. I added a carport and finally a screened porch, new stairs and decking, a waterfall and pond. Soon I would be gone.</p>
<p>The man who had installed the new sliding door told me that it was far superior to the old lopsided door that had never opened smoothly in the first place. “Botched installation,” he said, pointing out the rough and bent ridges of the original sliders. I had periodically re-greased them, but it never really helped.</p>
<p>The improved door was all metal, and too heavy and snug to be lifted off its track by burglars, he said. The way he said it kind of gave me the creeps. Something about my country house on fifty acres of trees always brought forth the approval of men, and their obvious envy made me nervous. Some of the men had wanted to move in with me after a few dates, and more than a few I’d hired to fix things over the last fourteen years had tried to sabotage something, maybe in hopes of returning.</p>
<p>&#8220;What about snakes?&#8221; I asked him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Snakes?&#8221; He reared up from the lock he was tamping and peered at me as if he’d seen Medusa.</p>
<p>His tense shoulders said it all, all that I imagined he thought about me: that if I was scared of snakes, maybe I and my copious bookcases belonged in a townhouse, not way out here in the sticks with wild turkeys and deer, owls, raccoons, three kinds of woodpeckers and the occasional fox, rare bobwhite and black bear. He didn’t know I’d seen a mountain lion perched on an outcrop like a watchful old spirit guide one bitter winter night. And in the rocks and woodpiles: snakes, an assortment of mostly invisible beauties. Timber rattlers; copperheads; the hog-nose rooting for toads; smooth black snakes keeping the perimeters clear; water moccasins down at the creek, swimming with their mouths unhinged, skimming the surface, each snake far more than a word to me. But how could this stranger know?</p>
<p>SOMETIMES ON SUMMER mornings mist wrapped my mountain, or, in winter, its rough, jagged shape caught the light stark against a cloudless sky. Spring trees dressed its angles with clumps of impossible green. Soon the color would molt again, transform, shedding red and orange down its slopes to tumble across the valley toward my porch and into my eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; I said to the door installer. &#8220;It was just a lame joke.”</p>
<p>&#8220;You had me going there with your snakes. I’d rather kill them than look at them, myself.&#8221;<br />
So, he was scared of snakes. That’s all. His face relaxed, and he bent back to his task, to test the new lock against the strike plate for the perfect fit.</p>
<p>It would be years before I was ready to sell that house, trade that solitude, that close range view of a mountainside and all of the creatures that came along with it. Neither of us knew what was coming next. The door was so heavy, he reassured me, that I wouldn’t need a sawed-off broomstick wedged in it for extra protection any more. No one could lift it off its sturdy new tracks, and nothing dangerous or beautiful could ripple through a gap.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Hawk and the Swallow</strong></p>
<p>Understand this: I had thought long and hard about birds. I had once, in fact, been a Fisheries and Wildlife major. I’d worked at a wildlife research center, fed waterfowl, cut up mice for raptors, taken blood from the veined wings of ducks, and, I’m sorry to say, “sacrificed” them for research purposes. The point is, I wasn’t a shrinking violet, and I’d paid a certain kind of attention, but I was a sucker for the Big and Dramatic &#8212; namely predatory birds like the osprey, the red-tailed hawk, the bald eagle. <em>Raptors Magnificus</em> floated my boat, especially in the Wide Open Spaces of the American West. My father, however, though he was a manly ex-fighter pilot and admirer of John Wayne, preferred a bird I frequently overlooked: the purple martin.</p>
<p>A nondescript swallow, I thought. A bird smaller than my hand, the male is the only swallow with a completely dark plumage, glossy blue-black above and below. The female has a similar back, but her chest and belly are a dingier gray-brown. In certain light, the bird’s glossy dark back looks purple &#8212; thus the name. In the air, they sometimes seemed to swarm, but each individual’s flight was difficult for me to follow. They were so small and fast that I couldn’t keep my binoculars trained on them for long. I much preferred the big hawks whose movements I could often make out with no field glasses at all.</p>
<p>Yet my father was fascinated by them.</p>
<p>He’d majored in zoology at the University of Kansas, finishing up what was left of his Navy-funded education around 1960, when I was a toddler. Later he’d taught me how to pay attention to the natural world. Sycamore trees had the big broad distinctive leaves and the peeley bark. Loblolly pines were the tall slim-trunked trees with the needles I had to rake constantly from the grass in our yard. The big tree I climbed in the side yard was a maple. He showed me how to use field guides and identify the songbirds that congregated at the feeders in our backyards. Bright red cardinals (my mother’s favorite) with their peaked caps were easy. Fussy jays often left behind bright blue feathers. Robins bobbed and hunted worms in the driveway after a rainstorm. Sparrows and towhees were common, but when the hawk-sized pileated woodpecker showed up, both my parents shouted for all to come and see. Perhaps because of this family value on nature, and the trailering we did as a family of five &#8212; once all the way across the country from California to Virginia &#8212; I’d developed a passion for the outdoors and spent hours in the Tidewater of Virginia daydreaming about how to get out West for a Rocky Mountain High. Indeed, John Denver’s album was among my first when I was coming of age in the 1970s. Birdneck Point, Bird Sanctuary, as our neighborhood announced itself, was lovely, but I wanted more drama in my life.</p>
<p>Thus, the road took me West, where I could sit on cliff edges and watch ravens soar and play on the wind. Red-tailed hawks flew low over the sagebrush, then arced upward into the sky, where they circled with their mates. Bald eagles and osprey hung out in the trees by the river or over the mountains along the Puget Sound. Osprey in particular built huge impressive stick nests on telephone poles in the open spaces near rivers and lakes. If I had to be reincarnated, I wanted to come back as an osprey. The joy, for me, was to be able to see over wide expanses of sky populated by one or two big soaring birds tracing the movement of the wind.</p>
<p>Who wanted to watch the nondescript swallows?</p>
<p>Yet, when I went back to Virginia, where my parents now lived on a 90-acre“gentleman’s farm” in the Shenandoah Valley, and allowed myself to enter “retirement time” with my parents &#8212; that less-hurried, less-harried lifestyle I both dreaded and desired &#8212; I was intrigued by the colony of purple martins living in the two apartment houses my father had erected for them.  Standing next to their houses, I craned my head back and watched them. Indeed, they were aerially acrobatic as they pursued a swarm of insects. Flying around each other expertly, they’d appear to be on collision course and then tilt their wings for a miss. They’d flap their wings and then sail, flap and sail, beautifully proportioned, streamlined, not unlike miniature planes with their outstretched triangular wings.</p>
<p>Arthur C. Bent’s 1942 monograph for the Smithsonian Institution offers Witmer Stone’s 1937 description of the martin’s flight:</p>
<p>Now one of them turns in his course and passes close to my head, swift as an arrow and uncanny in his blackness, which has no relieving spot of white, not even on the belly. . . . Again he will mount upward with rapid strokes of his narrow pointed wings only to return again to the lower level on a long sloping sail. Sometimes at the very summit of the ascent he will come about into the wind and remain stationary, on rapidly beating wings, before sliding away on the long downward sail. When flying high over the town, late in the summer, the Martins&#8217; mastery of the air is particularly noticeable.</p>
<p><em>Mastery of the air</em>. A marvelous phrase, descriptive not only of the martins but also of the males in my family. My father had flown one of the first jets &#8212; the F9F Panther jet &#8212; for the Navy during the Korean War, my brother flew the F-14 years later. Both of them landed and took off from carrier decks, making postage-stamp landings as the ship’s surface moved up and down on the heaving waves. I didn’t want to imagine it, much less execute it. For me, the only flights were flights on which I was a passenger, or &#8212; more frequently &#8212; flights of fancy.</p>
<p>In fact, my role in the family was determined early on: my father said I was the best dreamer.  As a girl, I do remember wishing I could fly. Someone told me if I ate a carton of Morton’s salt, I could do it. Not the big round carton, but a miniature size, as the vodka bottle on an airplane is to the larger version. I loved salt, so it wasn’t hard. After I downed the full container, I climbed a few feet up on a ladder and jumped. Gravity, of course, proved stronger than the flight of fancy.</p>
<p>My father, as a boy, made cardboard wings and ran down the alleyways in Altoona, Pennsylvania, trying to catch the wind. He built model planes from balsa wood and glue and found himself glued, also, to World War II movies. In fact, he volunteered to join the Navy toward the end of the war, at age seventeen, in Philadelphia, but it wasn’t until the Cold War, after a couple of years at the University of Pennsylvania, that he trained in earnest as a Navy pilot, going on to fly in combat in the Korean War.</p>
<p><strong>Luck</strong><br />
Beyond the blue rectangular pool surrounded by red brick, drinking our pre-dinner drinks, my parents and I could see the big barn painted a warm beige &#8212; my mother’s choice. The roof had flown off that barn once during a storm, nearly hitting my ex-fighter-pilot father inside his truck at the pasture gate. It surely would have killed him, but instead it plowed into a tractor shed &#8212; another moment of the sheer unadulterated luck that has followed him (so far) through life. The very day he was sworn into the Navy in 1945, he emerged from the building to find that World War II was over: it was VJ Day. Some years later, he was called from the cockpits of two different airplanes because, as a pilot with an instrument rating, he was needed to fly a different craft. After his replacement pilot took off, each original airplane had a mechanical failure, killing the unfortunate substitutes in separate crashes. The Navy, said my father, had orders to keep flying the aging planes, although they needed replacing. At that point, my father decided to quit flying and asked for reassignment to the Supply Corps.</p>
<p>He tells the story in summary &#8212; a rendering that, like the government documents he had to write and sign &#8212; leaves out the drama and horror of what he must have felt when he heard of his compatriots’ deaths. He knew what a dead pilot looked like. He’d been in charge of “clean up” after airplane crashes when he was stationed at Kingsville, Texas after the war. While at that post, he met my mother, a high school English teacher, in Corpus Christi.</p>
<p>All these years later, my mother listens to his story from her patio chair. Dressed in a red scoop-necked T-shirt and white capris, she holds onto her iced Manhattan, looking like a woman at a cocktail party with her shiny silver bangs and red lipstick. Her eyes still get wide when she says, “He had the keys to the King Ranch. No one had the keys to the King Ranch.” She gives her head a shake, her hair catching the evening light. The King Ranch in South Texas &#8212; an acreage the size of Rhode Island still home to some 60,000 cattle and 300 Quarter Horses &#8212; only offered its 150 years of history to the public during visiting hours. To be given the keys to such a place was impressive indeed.</p>
<p>My father shrugs. At 82, he’s thinner than ever, though he still does 50 crunches and push-ups a day, lifts weights, plays tennis and golf, gardens, repairs fences and tractors and keeps the place shipshape. He’s not a big man &#8212; maybe 5’10” and 150 pounds &#8212; but he’s always been determined, persistent, his blue eyes shining. Those blue eyes have always been ablaze with his various passions, whether they be the glory days of his flying, the richness of his garden, the excellence of my mother or the purple martins. “I <em>had</em> to have the keys to get in if there was a crash,&#8221; he recounts.</p>
<p>“I thought that was a terrible thing to do to an aviator,” says my mother.</p>
<p>“It didn’t bother me,” my father responds. “I loved flying.”</p>
<p>Watching the swallows swoop and skim to drink from the swimming pool before they chased insects in loops and wingovers, nearly colliding but never touching, as they joyfully found their suppers, I thought perhaps that was how my father dealt with sorrow &#8212; dip, taste if you must, then fly away. Don’t give yourself over to the depths of what touches you. Instead, take to the sky, to the joy of flight. It helps, of course, if you’re lucky.</p>
<p>IN FACT, SWALLOWS are said to bring luck. Their arrival portends springtime. They appear on flowering branches in Chinese paintings and are the harbinger of new love in Egyptian poetry. The Egyptian <em>Book of the Dead</em> instructs the deceased how to transform into a swallow, and the ancient Greeks and Romans believed the souls of dead children live on in the bodies of swallows. For pilgrims on their way to Mecca, the swallow is a symbol of fidelity: before people knew the birds migrated to Brazil, Muslims thought they went to Mecca.</p>
<p>Although some cultures warn that a swallow flying through the house portends bad luck, seamen welcome them on board as a sign of approaching land. Migrating between South and North America, of course, swallows range be far out to sea. Seamen who’ve sailed more than 5,000 miles wear a swallow tattoo; two swallow tattoos equal 10,000 miles, and a swallow with a knife through its heart is a memorial for a friend lost at sea. Thus, the largest swallow, the purple martin, is an appropriate favorite for my retired-Navy father.</p>
<p>FOR ME, ON the other hand, the tattooed swallow once signaled danger. As a teenager in Virginia Beach, sitting in my bikini on a towel, I frequently had to figure out how to ward off invasion by swallow-armed sailors who didn’t realize (or didn’t care) that I was underage.</p>
<p>I have other associations to overcome. Considering the martins from the farmhouse porch as they perched on an electrical wire against the evening sky, I saw something familiar in their heart-shaped silhouettes: weren’t they the cartoon birds that helped damsels in distress like Cinderella and Snow White? In my Golden Book circa 1965, Snow White rests her elbows on the windowsill to look out, and a songbird perches on her finger. This is the image of all that is good and pure from the <em>Good Housekeeping</em> era: the pale, raven-haired, wasp-waisted heroine keeping house and enjoying the quiet while her miniature men earn a living. In this Garden of Eden, pre-poisoned-apple moment, Snow White’s joyful submission to the drudgery of housework puts her in harmony with the swallows and songbirds, warbling their helpful melodies. She’s the happy bauble awaiting the return of her asexual men. It’s an image of entrapment that the feminist in me rejects. Unlike my father, I have never associated swallows with freedom.</p>
<p><strong>Housing</strong><br />
My father latched onto the swallows just as he was making his own transition from the air to the ground. He was going to college at University of Kansas in 1960-61 when a biology teacher offered purple martin houses to interested students and urged them to observe the inhabitants. My father, wishing to identify particular birds, loaded paintbrushes and mounted them above each apartment entrance to mark the birds’ feathers. He and my mother named the birds. When my Texan grandmother came to visit, she became so fascinated by the project that she got up at 4 a.m. to make notes about the birds’ behavior. Although I was just a toddler and have no memory of it, my parents’ stories of their time in Lawrence, Kansas is integrally connected in my mind with their passion for the purple martins, and I can’t help but associate the open skies and green hills of Kansas with my parents’ youthful enthusiasm for these swallows.</p>
<p>My father’s neighbors have erected purple martin houses to no avail on their woodsier lots, but the birds prefer my parents’ place, with its superior airspace. They like the electrical wires, which provide easy perches near their “apartments.” In fact, my father chose to install overhead rather than underground wires because he was thinking of the birds. The Big Sky, as my parents call it, is a feature they sought for my mother, too, when they bought their 90-acre gentleman’s farm and named it Riverbend. Though, as the daughter of an Air Force man and wife of a Navy pilot, my mother is a bit of a migrant herself, she grew up mostly in Arizona and Texas and feels most at home where she can see the horizon.</p>
<p>IN THE EASTERN U.S., purple martins used to nest in tree or cliffside cavities, but they quickly came to prefer artificial dwellings, and now they nest exclusively in human-made high-rise houses raised up on poles or wires. My father has two such structures mounted at 11 and 14 feet, each with about nine “apartments.” Martins in the Western U.S. are more traditional: they still use their ancestral dwellings, supplemented by hollowed gourds people provide.</p>
<p>Griggsville, Illinois, advertises the purple martin as “America’s Most Wanted Bird.” Its town center features a 70-foot, 562-apartment high-rise for purple martins and a martin house on nearly every street corner. Not surprisingly, its main industry is the manufacture of martin houses by a company called Nature House, Inc., started by nature lover and former antennae manufacturer J.L. Wade. During the pesticide worries of the 1960s, martins were thought to be good controllers of mosquitoes, but a study done by the Purple Martin Society concluded that, although martins consume a wide variety of flying insects &#8212; dragonflies, damselflies, flies, midges, grasshoppers, Japanese beetles &#8212; they don’t eat many mosquitoes.</p>
<p>An &#8220;Animal Planet&#8221; video clip shows an Ohio couple who remind me of my parents &#8212; attractive and apparently affluent, the gray-haired pair dressed in matching khaki shorts and tidy round-collared knit shirts (hers pink and his blue) and white tennis shoes. A knee-high dog with a long fluffy tail stands with them as they watch their purple martin houses with binoculars from their back porch.</p>
<p>The Ohio man grows gourds for the martins in his garden and hollows them out with tools in his shop. He strings a slew of gourds on wires between what appear to be telephone poles. With a pulley system, he can raise and lower the wires to check nests and clean out parasites. These are, apparently, condos with cleaning service, available only to the most upscale birds.</p>
<p>At the end of breeding season, all martins fly to Brazil for the winter. Condos in Ohio for the summer, Brazil for the winter. Monogamous pairing. Equal partnering in the nest-building, egg-warming and hatchling-feeding activities. Nice life.</p>
<p><strong>War</strong><br />
Sketches by a man with the unlikely name of Delmar Holdgrafer, cartoonist for the Purple Martin Society, suggest that landlords’ devotion to their tenants is a cultural phenomenon. One in particular reminds me of my ex-fighter pilot father. Peanuts’ Snoopy and a purple martin ride atop their respective houses manning machine guns. As they swoop toward an unsuspecting man whose hat has already been knocked off by a purple martin, Snoopy advises, “Get as close as you can before you climb up out of your dive.”</p>
<p>In the Korean War, my father was advised to hit “Targets of Opportunity”: bridges, trains, boats &#8212; anything that looked like it might carry people or objects related to the conquest of territory. “Anything that moved,” says my father. He remembers flying low over a fishing boat and seeing three men, afraid for their lives, jump overboard. “I could’ve killed those guys, but I didn’t,” he says. “They were just fishermen.”</p>
<p>A few years ago, I sat watching a video of pilots taking off from an aircraft carrier to go into combat in the Korean War. With me in his living room were my father and two of his friends who flew with him during the war. The men had, with their wives, driven their RVs to my parents’ farm, and the weekend had been full of laughter and good energy, but as the pilots on the video got into their cockpits &#8212; dressed in flight suits like the one my handsome young father wears in the black-and-white photograph next to his F9F Panther jet on the dresser in my bedroom &#8212; the room was filled with a heavy silence. It was as if these gray-haired men who now piloted RVs felt the same dread they had when they entered those planes on the deck of the <em>Bonne Home Richard</em> (the Bonny Dick, as it was called, tongue-in-cheek).</p>
<p>How many compatriots had they lost? What did they think as they looked at these men in the video, so like themselves, in their twenties, the crème de la crème in terms of coordination, intelligence and courage? Did they now also realize the extent of the destruction they had wrought, trying to stay alive, do their duty and serve their country by strafing airplanes piloted by “gooks,” who were, in truth, just excellent young men like themselves? Had any of them, unlike my father, flown low over boats full of innocent fishermen and blown them away? If so, had they been able to forgive themselves that great wrong done in the service of American idealism?</p>
<p>A LITERARY CRITIC compares the sound of Odysseus&#8217; twanging bow-string to a swallow’s call. Odysseus made his bow sing upon return from his 10-year wandering after the Trojan War and found his house full of suitors for his faithful wife, Penelope, a woman who put off the men who wanted to take Odysseus’ place by telling them she would not marry until she finished weaving her father-in-law’s shroud. She wove by day and took her weaving apart by night, still hoping for her husband to return. The poet makes an appropriate comparison between the swallow and Odysseus: both are returnees &#8212; like the swallows, Odysseus finally comes back at his nesting grounds, ready to take aim in order to reclaim his territory.</p>
<p>PURPLE MARTINS ARE defenders of territory, too. My mother gets a charge out of the female’s insistence that the other “girls” stay out of her nest. Her favorite thing about the birds is their chatter. “You know they’re talking to each other,” she says. “It’s all consuming.” She tries to imitate the twittering, making a vibrating sound with her tongue and lips. She admires their monogamy, also: she and my father are going on their 55th year of marriage.</p>
<p>Predators and competition, of course, provide unwelcome drama in the lives of the martins. My father hasn’t forgotten saving the martins from a blacksnake after my grandmother saw something odd hanging from their birdhouse pole.</p>
<p>“She said, ‘It looks like a sock or piece of rope,’” my father recalls. “But it was a snake. The martins were going crazy.” He lowered the birdhouse so he could remove the snake. “I tried to give it to your mother, but she didn’t want it, so I let it go down by the river.”</p>
<p>After that, he put up a copper wire parallel to the post in the ground and connected it to the 4,000-volt electric fence. “I saw the snake go up again, but he got down in a hurry.”</p>
<p>The &#8220;Animal Planet&#8221; Ohio man uses a sentry system to warn the martins about hawks. Tree swallows, who nest nearby in boxes he provides, issue a high-pitched warning call that tips off the purple martins when hawks are in the area. My father also keeps a loaded gun in his bedroom and regularly patrols the borders of his property. No one – man or beast or fowl &#8212; gets to fish or hunt on his land without his permission.</p>
<p><strong>Perennial Summer</strong><br />
Aristotle noted, &#8220;One swallow does not a summer make . . . ,” but summer is when swallows are most numerous, busily raising chicks in their apartment houses on my father’s Virginia farm. Males and females take turns caring for their young. They passionately defend their nests, fussing, with open beaks, in purple martin language and making expert aeronautical maneuvers overhead in their quest for insects.</p>
<p>Purple martins don’t show up much in central Washington state, where I live now. They like water, and the insects that gather near water, so they do appear west of the Cascades, where &#8212; unlike the eastern birds in their tenements &#8212; they prefer to nest singly in boxes over water. Yet, because of my parents’ passion, when I walk my dogs down Idaho Street toward the local irrigation canal, I notice the swarm of swallows &#8212; not purple martins but cliff swallows &#8212; described collectively as a “richness” of swallows.</p>
<p>Now, even when a hawk flies low over a distant cow pasture, drawing my attention to its swoop of feathers over high grass under a wide-open central Washington summer sky, I am more tuned in to the swallows than to this big predatory bird. A swallow flies right at me, a few feet overhead, tips its wings and makes a 90-degree turn, then flutters, turns, and goes the opposite direction. There’s another, and another, and several fly at once in a narrow airspace that must be full of bugs. They come at each other in what appears an impending collision, then tip their wings and miss by inches. Such a common bird. Tiny, dark, persistent in its pursuit of insects, flying in great “richnesses” from one continent to another. In this moment of communion with these birds, I am connected to their cousins, the purple martins, on my parents’ farm, and to my parents, especially my father the ex-fighter pilot, and seeing their flight I feel all the joys and sorrows of our trajectories.</p>
