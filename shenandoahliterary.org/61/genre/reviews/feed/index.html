								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Consequence-Cynthia-Hogue/dp/1597094765"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-824" title="Or Consequence by Cynthia Hogue" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/04/41bQcnBwnTL-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300" srcset="https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/04/41bQcnBwnTL-199x300.jpg 199w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/04/41bQcnBwnTL.jpg 333w" sizes="(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px" /></a>Fifteen people, mostly women, were gathered in a hotel conference room in Victoria, British Columbia &#8212; one of those grand old buildings where the wireless doesn’t work and photographs of Queen Elizabeth adorn the lobby. The space was cramped and airless, so someone&#8217;s leather satchel propped open the heavy door. Four scholars had just delivered papers on the effects of literary patronage in the modernist era, and during the lively question period the group discussed contemporary versions of the phenomenon: how universities have become North American poetry&#8217;s most significant supporters, for example, and the effects of corporate patronage from grant-giving foundations. The limited bounty is distributed unevenly, with many strings attached, as largesse always has been, but it remains very difficult for a poet to keep working and reaching appreciative audiences without such aid. Cynthia Hogue, a specialist in poetry by American women, acknowledged these conditions when she referred to the adage that the best work eventually rises to the top regardless of how resources flow. “We know that’s not true,” she said. Half of the people present sighed. Although there is some correlation between canonicity and the power of the verse, the more one reads, the more exceptions one finds. It also becomes obvious that reception shapes poetry as it is being produced. A few poets are brilliantly ruthless competitors who claim starring roles in the stories now being told about contemporary writing. Others pretend to ignore the jockeying completely; most occupy some ambivalent middle ground. The consequence for a passionate poetry reader is that one has to keep sitting in a series of small rooms, wedging the door open, hoping for a signal and leveling arguments about why the poetry one loves deserves better accommodations.</p>
<p>Cynthia Hogue has co-edited influential anthologies and published distinguished works of scholarship; these writings advance her own passionate arguments on behalf of the poetry she loves. She has also published six poetry collections, won major awards and earned an endowed chair at Arizona State University. In the competition for patronage, she has fared better than most. Still, her own verse is not as widely known as it ought to be. <em>Or Consequence,</em> Hogue’s 2010 collection from Red Hen Press, occupies a space between the various schools and movements that undergird contemporary poetic reputations and shape the field’s controlling narratives. <em>Or Consequence</em> develops many of the obsessions percolating through Hogue’s previous books, but it also takes an analytic turn. It is Hogue’s most ambitious collection in its multilayered pitch for human and aesthetic connection. Such bridges are sustained, according to Hogue, by the partial, precarious, and yet profoundly important stories we tell about ourselves and others.</p>
<p>HOGUE BEGAN PUBLISHING poetry in the eighties, oscillating between mystical lyricism and a fierce poetry of witness. Her first book, <em>When Parallels Cross</em> (Whiteknights Press, 1983), a limited edition fine press publication in England, is now difficult to find, although Hogue reworks and expands the material nearly two decades later for <em>Flux</em> (New Issues Press, 2002). <em>Woman in Red</em> (Ahsahta Press, 1989) continues her exploration of myths and folktales, particularly narratives about predation and the dangers girls and women face, but in a looser, more direct style. The poems in <em>The Never Wife</em> (Mammoth Press, 1999), her next collection, are more powerful and more controlled in their handling of similar material. Assault and violent death are recurrent subjects; a sequence about New Orleans in the early nineties is particularly memorable, as is the elegy “Domestic Memorial” and the darkly funny “Epithalamium.” These early books also echo with references to Hogue’s touchstone poets, particularly Emily Dickinson, whose phrases and fascinations continue to resonate in Hogue’s recent work.</p>
<p>The mystical and surreal strain in Hogue’s poetry emerges vibrantly in the wonderful collection <em>Flux</em>. This book, containing Hogue’s most sound-driven and perhaps her most elliptical poetry, layers the landscapes of Iceland and the American Southwest so that they seem strangely akin in their desolation &#8212; dreamlike places of death, birth and other transformations. For one character, “sound becomes a trail,” epitomizing the intertwined motifs of listening and traveling as Hogue follows language to its mysterious sources. She explores the idea and the origins of voice more deliberately and intellectually in <em>The Incognito Body</em> (Red Hen, 2006), another especially beautiful book.  <em>The Incognito Body</em> begins with the oracle at Delphi, ends with psalms and centers on the profoundly dislocating experience of major illness. The book’s fragmentary title sequence engages the intense chronic pain of rheumatoid arthritis in both a theoretical and a visceral way. Hogue juxtaposes passages in meter and rhyme with blocks of scientific prose, capitalizes bits of words to suggest surprising correspondences &#8212; messages buried within messages &#8212; and uses shifting margins to represent a radically divided self. The scholar Elaine Scarry, whom Hogue quotes in an epigraph, has influentially argued that pain destroys language, but while Hogue dramatizes this ruin by repeatedly breaking the lyric spell she is so good at casting, she also questions Scarry’s premises. Pain, Hogue’s poetry implies, magnifies a division that is always a part of human experience. We are bodies, but we also exist through language and dream, translating our senses’ sybil-line pronouncements in shifting, contradictory ways.</p>
<p>The boundaries of the self, the experience of consciousness, and the tricky business of representing selfhood become the chief material of <em>Or Consequence</em>. This is a humane book about having survived pain and found joy, by a person deeply interested in continuities and ruptures between past and present; its poems explore borderlands and liminal places with an emphasis on connection rather than division. One of its most surprising aspects is how it encompasses both philosophy and autobiography, intellectual exploration and examination of feeling, especially love. Or Consequence is full of medium-length poems that accrue force through the complexity of juxtaposed ideas more than through the resonance of interwoven sounds. The collection is thus less lyrical than her earlier books, stretching the mode to embrace an unusually wide scope: Hogue’s poetry considers &#8212; with appropriate measures of skepticism, humor and kindness &#8212; what it means to be a twenty-first-century citizen of the United States.</p>
<p>To start with the middle: the second of the book’s three sections, “New Orleans Suite,” calls back to Hogue’s earlier writing about that city and provides a counterpart to her recent collaboration with photographer Rebecca Ross in <em>When the Water Came: Evacuees of Hurricane Katrina</em> (UNO Press, 2010). “Arseniad” tells the extraordinary tale of a woman, referred to in court documents as “Arsene (alias Cora),” who traveled to France as a slave with her owners in 1836 and automatically became, by French law, a free person. Eight years later, back in New Orleans, Arsene’s former owner tried to sell her as chattel. She sued for her liberty, won the case, and disappeared from historical record. It is enormously problematic for a white poet to represent the experience of a former slave who can no longer speak for herself. Arsene exists now only in secondhand accounts, preserved in an archive. Hogue conveys respect by carefully distinguishing fact from conjecture and directly acknowledging her distance from Arsene: “My words cannot find her / or become her.” Hogue’s deference could squash the vitality of the poem, but it doesn’t; instead, she preserves a sense that Arsene was a real person, irreducible to a symbol and celebrates her triumphant escape from representation in poetry or definition by racist law. Hogue also recreates the shiver an archival researcher feels when history becomes intensely present, if only momentarily. “Arseniad” invites readers to share Hogue’s sense of uncanny, improbable connection to Arsene.</p>
<p>Other pieces in “New Orleans Suite,” set after the hurricanes and their terrible aftermath, deepen the meaning of Arsene’s escape and complicate “Arseniad”’s evocation of the archive. Two ekphrastic poems allude to “Floodwall,” artist Jana Napoli’s installation built from hundreds of salvaged empty bureau, desk and cabinet drawers. Both Napoli and Hogue focus on what has been lost. In “Seeking as in: Sign (Silence),” Hogue can’t even find Napoli’s installation and wanders around New York on a February night asking after Liberty Street. In her journey she first avoids and then returns to speak to a homeless veteran before finally discovering the wreckage of another twenty-first-century disaster: the absence that is Ground Zero. Hogue represents the contemporary United States as a marred, unjust place, but her response is to keep looking for connection and trying to make meaning. “The Green Card Is Not Green,” another multi-part poem near the end of the book, is a terrific example. Hogue mocks the absurdly empty language of bureaucracy and details the impediments to real exchange the U.S. government creates:</p>
<p>I enter a strange country<br />
and myself become strange. Étrangère.<br />
At that moment, my Resident Alien husband becomes Citizen.<br />
We are, between us,<br />
two beings of determinate but shifting identities,<br />
always in transit, self-shifting,<br />
one of us word-less,<br />
one of us defined by prohibitions. . . .<br />
You are invited to submit<br />
an application for an extension<br />
of the red tape in which to encase<br />
your green card.</p>
<p>The latter experiences are grounded in marriage, a union between two separate beings &#8212; in this case French and American. Their romance, one bridge among many, is central to the collection.</p>
<p>These politically charged poems give Or Consequence heft, but the book also contains many pages of lyric meditation, particularly in the intermittent “Étude”s. The witty linguistic play of the latter poems teases out the speaker’s self-consciousness about language as a medium &#8212; imperfect, and yet an instrument of human connection. The most beautiful is “Étude (on Memory),” recounting a visit to the Loire Valley that reflects on its invasion in 1940:</p>
<p>Ramparts form a sheer wall<br />
of mossed granite, desiccate tufts<br />
on nubbed stone: the green will<br />
that was here gone to ground<br />
but around we walk on the crest<br />
in a driving wind. The grit in it<br />
force of it opens our coats,<br />
deepens the crag of cheek when you grin,<br />
reddens the freckles where your hair recedes.<br />
I hear my name called so clearly I glance back.<br />
It’s your voice but you aren’t there<br />
(a resonance or vibration the brain perceives),<br />
maybe the memory of having heard. . . .</p>
<p>The poem concerns a violent rupture of borders and describes a hard landscape, now full of graves and plaques. The wind even tears at this couple’s clothing, plucking away their bodily warmth. Nonetheless, several elements work to counteract the assault and repair the damage. Hogue weaves the lines together sonically through internal rhyme (ground/around), pararhyme (wall/will) and the reshuffled consonants of “crest” and “coats.” A voice haunts her, suggesting communication just beyond the threshold of perception. Most moving, though, are the links between the speaker and her vividly present companion, who mirrors the rugged terrain through his “crag of cheek.” The poem ends as his hand catches hers, “so/ cold I turn.” There is no denying the harshness of the environment and its effects on the couple, but Hogue emphasizes their bond nevertheless.</p>
<p>The title <em>Or Consequence</em> doesn’t compel my interest as thoroughly as the poems within. It does highlight causation, though, and how Hogue handles the costs and pleasures of narrative. In the final poem, “The Bridge,” she paraphrases Vaclav Havel, endorsing</p>
<p>. . .the refusal<br />
to live without meaning,<br />
without, finally, love,<br />
even in conditions as<br />
hopeless as ours. . . .</p>
<p>When Hogue dismantles words, sentences, truisms and patriotic rhetoric, she is critiquing the most pernicious uses of language around us, but that critique is only a first move, and not the most important one. She is also propping open doors, assembling material for monuments, and housing a truly constructive spirit of respect and connection. Politicians often seek to “control the narrative” more cannily and doggedly than they redress injustice, so it is understandable that many contemporary poets profoundly distrust story, right down to the level of syntax. Without it, though, there can be no arguments on behalf of love or art. A poem’s intimate room needs to stand ajar, signals beamed in and conversation spilling into the halls. Hogue’s poetics of generosity is so thoughtfully, deftly framed that she actually manages it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Rendering-New-Selected-Poems/dp/0547249624"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-821" title="AmericanRendering" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/04/AmericanRendering-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300" srcset="https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/04/AmericanRendering-199x300.jpg 199w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/04/AmericanRendering.jpg 332w" sizes="(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px" /></a>What do we make these days of the term &#8220;Southern Gothic&#8221;? Has it only become a way to promote an author, as in the way the dust jacket of Andrew Hudgins&#8217;s new and selected poems, <em>American Rendering</em>, flaunts that Hudgins has &#8220;developed a distinctively descriptive form of the Southern Gothic imagination&#8221;? If so, we’ve come far in the 60 years since Tennessee Williams lamented that the term was “used as a major line of attack” by “critics, publishers, distributors, not to mention the reading public.” Or has “Southern gothic” come to refer to a notable form emerging from a distinctive regional literature?</p>
<p>Certainly, we have the familiar tropes of the Gothic in Hudgins&#8217; new poems: ghosts (&#8220;a creature formed of light / steps through the wall&#8221;), redemptive violence (&#8220;He bucked hard once, went limp, / and I spat his blood onto his un-tensed un-sentences&#8221;), manmade structures burning to the ground (“’He lay so near the burning house / his grease stewed out of him&#8221;), characters of questionable sanity (&#8220;Lorraine sang, Mouth or knife&#8221;) and speakers who elicit both sympathy and disgust (&#8220;I pulled carpet remnants over me, and that night / I married&#8221;). These poems also include the Southern themes that have been a hallmark of Hudgins&#8217;s poetry: race relations, childhood memories, rural landscapes, regional dialogue, small portraits of everyday life in the South and Biblical allusions and cadences. To be fair, these are also the themes that in the past have provoked critics to charge that Hudgins’s poems are too sentimental or crude.</p>
<p>But if we do have moments of sentimentality in these new poems—“the impossible possible once more and beauty, in perspective, / beautiful” or “For that minute, that moment, that / passage of time, I was / not childless, or a man”—they are few and far between and don’t overshadow moments of powerful authority, as when the speaker in the title poem describes how “a scorched theriaca / haloed the flames, the grease by which / we render America.” Indeed, Hudgins will approach sentimental subjects &#8212; a funeral, a wedding, a mother’s death, a friend’s suffering &#8212; only to downplay, or deny, their sentimentality by exposing, through uses of Gothic elements, their true horror and isolation.</p>
<p>But is simply combining “Gothic” and “Southern” elements the recipe for the “Southern Gothic”? If so, could we take a writer like Phil Levine, who also writes of barren landscapes, redemptive violence and characters who evoke both sympathy and disgust (only usually set against landscapes of the industrial Rust Belt) and call him an “Upper Midwestern Gothic” writer? Would the label stick?</p>
<p>These are rhetorical questions, of course, because the answer is more intuitive and requires the necessary element of the sublime. Lewis Simpson wrote that “the present-day southern gothic defines itself in examples as a vision of life that blends realism and grotesquery in a manner that we readily grasp as typical of the southern literary imagination,” and under such criteria, the answer is yes, Andrew Hudgins is indeed a writer of the Southern Gothic imagination, and a very fine one at that (by <a href="http://www.dresshead.com/dresshead-staff-profile-joann-whiteside" style="text-decoration: none;color: #333">whiteside</a> at <a href="http://www.dresshead.com" style="text-decoration: none;color: #333">http://www.dresshead.com</a>). Hudgins is also one of the few poets practicing this genre. And because poetry is (typically, and especially in the lyric mode) more concerned with investigations of consciousness than the narrator’s revealing of information, the poem can serve as a better forum for the kind of imaginative leaps that blend realism and grotesquery.</p>
<p>Hudgins remains one of the best contemporary poets at conflating the lyric and the dramatic, which is to say, he is skilled at making imaginative leaps. There are moments of remarkable, subliminal transformation in these new poems, as in &#8220;After Teaching,&#8221; when the speaker sees &#8220;inside the larger swelling of Benita&#8217;s swell, / an ancient old couple turn a corner in an ancient city.&#8221; Or in &#8220;The Bluebird, Singing, Leaps into the Sky,&#8221; when a bluebird, killed by a young boy on a hunt with his father and grandfather</p>
<blockquote><p>leaps into the sky<br />
and from the sumac, bewildered,<br />
running with outstretched bloodstained arms,<br />
eyes shy and nearly wild,<br />
there staggers toward them helplessly<br />
the blue unborning child.</p></blockquote>
<p>We might be satisfied with the good content here, but there are also fine formal poems in this sequence, including a villanelle (the haunting elegy “The Names of the Lost”) and a sequence of five ballads (or near-ballads with off-rhymes). But the near-perfect pacing of these poems is achieved more often than not through the play between a polysyllabic consonance and a beautiful, liquid assonance, as in &#8220;Mother&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>I followed my shadow to an appealingly dilapidated pond. Ghostly koi coasted under ripples undulating to the tempo of hidden pumps. Fish mouths mouthed my shadow</p></blockquote>
<p>These lines have a haunting sound, reminiscent of the language of the Southern Gothic, and coming from, of all people, a golf caddie. Indeed, Hudgins&#8217;s speakers are often the cast-aside, the homeless, the drunks &#8212; what Molly Boyd calls the Southern Gothic’s “inbred lower class living in extreme isolation in closed communities, which are plagued by economic impoverishment, educational ignorance, religious fundamentalism, racial intolerance, genetic deformities, perverted sexuality, and unrequited violence.&#8221; They are people, in other words, with whom a poet of democratic and Whitmanic principles can empathize.</p>
<p>In Hudgins’s earlier collection <em>Babylon in a Jar</em>, whose 38 poems are represented by only 16 in this selection, the speaker in the title poem drives by and longs to be like the drunks, asleep on side of the road (&#8220;I&#8217;d never done that, slept the night, / drunk, beside my car, so I envied and hated the drunks slumped in the crushed oyster shell&#8221;). And in &#8220;Mother,&#8221; the opening poem in <em>American Rendering</em>, Hudgins seems to write in the voice of one of those drifters:</p>
<blockquote><p>After midnight, I dragged carpet padding<br />
from a trash bin and spread it on the asphalt<br />
between the wall and dumpster. Screened from sleet,<br />
I pulled carpet remnants over me.<br />
<em><br />
Similarly, in “A Handful of Keys”:</em><br />
When I woke, a tailpipe thrummed inches from my face,<br />
and it inquired, Sir, are you hurt? Solicitous automobile,<br />
I thought till I saw my own owlish face regarding me from the black<br />
sunglasses of a state trooper who asked<br />
if I’d been drinking.</p></blockquote>
<p>Are these the same figures as those who appear in &#8220;The Choice the Driver Makes,&#8221; one of the best poems from Hudgins&#8217;s first book, <em>Saints and Strangers</em>? In that poem a 34-year-old Hudgins wrote from the voice of a roadside stranger who is &#8220;invisible / until the harsh lights choose[s] me out of night.&#8221; Flannery O’Connor once advised writers to “draw large and startling characters,” and although Hudgins’s peripheral characters may not always be large, it is their startling qualities that lead the reader to new, contemporary considerations of the Southern Gothic.</p>
<p>After all, the best of the post-Faulkner Southern writers, including O&#8217;Connor and Barry Hannah, tend to render the South, at times, absurdly. Hudgins has also adopted this strategy, though occasionally the absurdity can lend itself to an unwelcome obscurity, as in “Under the Horse,” or distracting implausibility, as in “Came Back.” But the new poems in <em>American Rendering</em> do not necessarily, as one critic has said of Hudgins, enjoy “the moral precisions of family life.&#8221; At their best, they balance and resolve the tension between desire and violence, between sex and death, between the imaginative and the real. And thus the structure of this book makes sense &#8212; we read through the new poems  in the collection first, then make our way up through Hudgins’s career, beginning with the first book, discovering a poet who returns to the same themes, obsessively perhaps, but with more daring and brilliance and less sentimental attachment each time. It is enough to affirm that Southern Gothic has become a distinctive art form and lay to rest Tennessee Williams’s lament; yes, the Southern Gothic is alive and well in the hands of Andrew Hudgins.</p>

Dillard&#8217;s seventh collection of verse, <em>What Is Owed the Dead</em>, includes five poems that previously appeared in the pages of this magazine and manages to offer a unique breadth and depth of literary scope, primarily through its focus on a wide array of dead writers, celebrated and neglected, and its clever use of literary embeddings: passages drawn from the work of the deceased writers it addresses as well as that of those it does not.</p>
<p>Fifty-two poems make up this fifty-three- page collection, each of them sixteen lines long, but that is where uniform matters of form end for the most part. Diction, rhythm, and other conventions sometimes mirror those of the given writer at hand, but are frequently interrupted – sometimes jarringly – by a quotation from a writer (not necessarily the one to whom a poem is addressed) or an excerpt from Dillard&#8217;s writing journals, which span back to the 1950s. It is the former of these intrusions or &#8220;embeddings,&#8221; which lends the collection much, though certainly not all, of its resonance and power.</p>
<p>One of Dillard’s acknowledged literary masters, Nabokov, often performed the technique of embedding as a kind of game which also deepened meaning (the title of his book <em>Pale Fire</em>, for instance, draws upon passages from Shakespeare’s<em> Timon of Athens </em>and <em>Hamlet</em>). At their most dramatic and outrageous, embeddings may grow to become entire rewritings of celebrated literary texts, as seen in the work of Kathy Acker (a writer Dillard admires and author of radical rewritings of Cervantes, Dickens, Proust, and many others). In this way, a certain literary history or revisionist history is conveyed even as the writing simultaneously goes about generating other effects.</p>
<p>The embedding employed in What is Owed the Dead is rarely fluid or subtle. Rather, it readily announces its presence and identity by placing passages from writers in quotation marks and assigning them footnotes, which many readers likely will simply ignore in favor of skipping on to the next poem. Some of the best poems in the collection – &#8220;Raven&#8221; and &#8220;Fame,&#8221; for example – limit their embeddings either to a couple of passages by one or two different writers, or several by the same writer. In &#8220;Raven,&#8221; for instance, Poe and Nabokov are the only quoted writers, which makes the poem spare and austere, as opposed to many of the multiple-writer, quotation-laden poems that follow it:</p>
<blockquote><p>All those lies, caw caw cacophony,<br />
Smear the air like mustered crows,<br />
Is that what it all amounts to, crowbait,<br />
Glassy eyes, those “windows to the soul” . . . .</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Fame,&#8221; on the other hand, employs numerous quotes from six poems and two letters by Emily Dickinson. Yet any potential confusion in employing so many passages is largely dispelled by the fact that they all come from the same writer:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bolted door, not even “approbation of my dog,<br />
”Then “he kindly stopped” death, lonely “little<br />
Cottage,” fame,1,775 poems, glory, “called back.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The samplings in these lines arrive from four different sources, yet remain coherent and interwoven largely by virtue of the fact that Dickinson is their common creator.</p>
<p>There does not appear to exist any particular pattern to the dead writers Dillard has chosen to address: the book begins with Poe, Pound and Laurence Sterne and concludes with San Juan de la Cruz, Richard Wright and George Barker. It is Barker, whom Dillard identifies in the book&#8217;s credits as &#8220;the guiding spirit of this entire enterprise,&#8221; who provides the only piece in the book not written mostly by Dillard: the epilogue from his 1950 book, <em>The Dead Seagull</em>, which maintains, &#8220;[W]e, the living, are . . . indebted to our predecessors for some small mercies.&#8221; Bookending this epilogue is a short epigraph from Geoffrey Hill&#8217;s <em>The Triumph of Love</em> on the title page of Dillard&#8217;s book: &#8220;a daily acknowledgement/of what is owed the dead.&#8221; These framing passages from Barker and Hill offer one key (there are others) to reading the poems which lie between. They may be recognized as memorials stemming from indebtedness but which also have the capacity to aid us, as demonstrated by Dillard’s journal entries, in our present states of confusion, depression, and ambiguity.</p>
<p>This conceptual approach should not lead one to the conclusion that Dillard&#8217;s book is without humor. To the contrary, the easy familiarity with which he addresses some of the collection&#8217;s more canonical poets both humanizes them and offers a degree of levity at which their sycophantic followers very well may take offense. &#8220;You wanted it, Emily,&#8221; begins the poem to Dickinson, &#8220;glory, fame.&#8221; He goes on to address Pound as &#8220;Ez,&#8221; T.S. Eliot as &#8220;Tom,&#8221; Yeats as &#8220;Willie,&#8221; and so on. Yet these are instances of playfulness rather than disrespect, and help to rescue a book investigating such dark subject matter from lapsing into macabre plodding. Indeed, as one reads on it becomes clear the volume is as much a celebration of the active creative life of the present as it is a memorial to past lives and works.</p>
<p>An anecdote may serve as a fitting conclusion. A literary mentor once recounted to me that one evening while introducing George Garrett – the writer to whom Dillard’s collection is dedicated – Dillard remarked that Garrett surely was one of the best writers living, and “better than a lot of the dead ones too.” Among other things, this collection shows Dillard the poet as capable of holding his own among many of the departed versifiers to whom he and many others are indebted. We are both in good company and in good hands in the pages of <em>What is Owed the Dead</em>.</p>

<p>Christian Wiman’s exploration of grief and faith in <em>Every Riven Thing</em>, his third poetry collection, will not satisfy readers expecting either easy access or a sense of closure.  The literary and thematic connections with Wiman’s first two collections, <em>The Long Home</em> (Story Line Press, 1998, and Copper Canyon Press, 2007) and <em>Hard Night</em> (Copper Canyon Press, 2005), are apparent enough, but Wiman’s demand in his latest volume for the reader’s sustained attention is a departure from the more modest requirements of the poet’s earlier work.  The effort required by these poems is not always rewarded, but careful and patient readers will find much of the work ultimately satisfying.</p>
<p>No one will ever confuse Wiman with Billy Collins.  There are no dogs conducting orchestras here, no swirls into epiphany.  The poet’s focus is so concentrated and serious that the slightest deviations announce themselves.  At times, one senses a convert’s tendency to take everything – himself included – too seriously.  Even the book’s design suggests solemnity:  the faint cover image of a face emerging beneath the gothic font of the title; the white, gothic numerals on the otherwise solid black pages marking the volume’s three sections.  The effect is slightly disturbing; the impression is one of something foreboding, dangerous, even medieval.</p>
<p>Wiman’s prose offers one framework for considering <em>Every Riven Thing</em>.  As dangerous as it is to read biography into poems, in this instance the connection is unmistakable and the urge irresistible.  In his 2006 essay “Love Bade Me Welcome,” Wiman discloses that he has been diagnosed with an incurable cancer of the blood.  He also recalls a story told by Simone Weil, his spiritual mentor, in which two prisoners in adjoining cells learn over time to communicate by tapping and scratching on the dividing wall.  The wall both separates, and provides the only connection between, the prisoners.  In <em>Every Riven Thing</em>, the poet explores disease, grief and faith in three sections that move from the speaker’s anguished acceptance of his circumstance of disease, through an interlude of despair, to a focused theological framing of his condition.</p>
<p>Wiman’s facility with form is on display in the collection’s first section.  From the five rhymed couplets of “To Grasp at the Mercury Minnows Are” to the sixty-two lines in “Sitting Down to Breakfast Alone,” the section thrives on formal variety.  Even for a poet as formally dexterous as Wiman, though, the reach demanded by rhyme sometimes exceeds the poet’s grasp.  In “Sitting Down to Breakfast Alone,” the speaker describes a waitress and a scene in a small-town diner</p>
<p>where even the oldest in the old men’s booth<br />
swore as if it were scripture truth<br />
they’d never had a breakfast better,<br />
rapping a glass sharply to get her<br />
attention when it went sorrowing<br />
so far into some simple thing . . . .</p>
<p>More troubling, however – and indicative of these poems – is the poet’s unwillingness to provide emotional access points to the reader.  The poems are neither obscure nor overly difficult.  Notwithstanding the logical coherence, however, readers will leave many of the poems with little sense of connection to the speaker.  Here is “To Grasp at the Mercury Minnows Are” in its entirety:</p>
<p>To grasp at the mercury minnows are<br />
or were<br />
in childhood’s kingdom<br />
lord of boredom<br />
is to see<br />
through an intimate, ultimate clarity<br />
that galaxy shatter<br />
and like a mind of matter<br />
resolve itself star by slow star.<br />
To grasp at the mercury minnows are . . .</p>
<p>Concepts – “ultimate clarity,” “lord of boredom,” “childhood’s kingdom,” “mind of matter” – overpower the poem.</p>
<p>“Five Houses Down” is the most aesthetically satisfying poem in the first section, precisely because it grounds the reader in a place with identifiable characters and believable details without sacrificing the music of the lines and displays a rare touch of humor:</p>
<p>I loved his ten demented chickens<br />
and the hell-eyed dog, the mailbox<br />
shaped like a huge green gun.<br />
I loved the eyesore opulence<br />
of his five partial cars, the wonder-cluttered porch<br />
with its oilspill plumage, tools<br />
cauled in oil, the dark<br />
clockwork of disassembled engines<br />
christened Sweet Baby and benedicted Old Bitch . . . .</p>
<p>Yet, “Five Houses Down” does not belong, thematically or tonally, in the book.</p>
<p>Wiman establishes the tone of the volume’s first section in “After the Diagnosis,” “The Mole” and “Darkcharms.”  Their titles, alone, evoke sickness and dis-ease.  In the title poem, Wiman emphasizes the broken nature of human existence.  He repeats the first line, “God goes, belonging to every riven thing he’s made,” at the beginning of each stanza and again in a closing line.  Using form to advance content, the poet moves the caesura in each of the repeated lines, thereby disrupting their rhythm in different ways, until the final repetition in a complete declarative sentence that suggests both God’s disruptive role and God’s absence.</p>
<p>The most representative poem in the first section, however, is “This Mind of Dying,” a formal jewel capturing the tone of the book’s first two sections and anticipating the third by taking the form of a prayer of supplication directed to the speaker’s God, whom the speaker identifies with grief.  Unfortunately, the poem also reflects the collection’s tendency to conceptualize, rather than concretize:</p>
<p>My God my grief forgive my grief tamed in language<br />
to a fear that I can bear.<br />
Make of my anguish<br />
more than I can make.  Lord, hear my prayer.</p>
<p>The poem is a prayer of lament; it could have been written by the psalmist.</p>
<p>The second section of the volume is the least satisfying.  The first three poems – “Voice of One Head,” “Country in Search of a Symbol” and “The Wind Is One Force” – are unmistakably political and introduce a note of cultural criticism that makes only one more brief appearance near the end of section two in the seven named sections of “Not Altogether Gone,” a poem whose tone may be discerned from two of the section titles:  “Fuck Dominoes” and “Like a Dog Existence Is.”  The only rationale for including “Do You Remember the Rude Nudists” in the collection at all may be its introduction of the speaker’s lover, but the book does not need it.</p>
<p>More on point are the section’s final two poems, “A Good Landscape for Grief” and “Jouissance.”  The latter poem reinforces explicitly what the speaker has hinted in the preceding poems—the speaker struggles with inhabiting any sense of joy.  “A Good Landscape for Grief,” the penultimate poem in the second section, provides the clearest transition into the final section of the book.  It also contains some of the flaws that detract from the collection’s power.  In this poem, Wiman describes a “good landscape for grief” as an arid one.  In a striking, perhaps original, contrast, he compares the dry environment of grief with the saturated nature of depression:</p>
<p>Depression is a wet word, with ripe vines,<br />
claustrophobic moss, endless dripping<br />
instants which here have no more<br />
purchase on the earth<br />
than a tear from an armadillo’s eye.</p>
<p>The final image—that tear—is a strange one, but it chimes with the “here” in the third quoted line to locate the speaker unmistakably in the landscape of grief.  The poem’s close examination of the parched landscape of grief and the dripping enclosure of depression is masterful; however, Wiman diminishes the power of the contrast by confusing the speaker’s voice.  In line thirteen, Wiman employs the impersonal third-person singular when he writes of “one’s own maudlin drama.”  In line five and elsewhere, the speaker uses the second-person direct address or, alternatively, the reflexive “you.”  In the long comparison comprising lines sixteen through thirty-eight, Wiman dares the reader to figure it out:</p>
<p>We are gathered here to mark one man<br />
passing.  He is your father<br />
and your son, my mother and my self.<br />
Let us sing this city of instants<br />
come back to be a part of us.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the confusion in voice, however, the poem places the speaker firmly in the terrain of grief, and that is the essential setting for the third, and most rewarding, section of the book.</p>
<p>The last fourteen poems in the volume are theological.  Prayer is the dominant mode; but, these poems are not prayers of devotion to a divinity with whom the speaker is in close relationship.  These are prayers of the psalmist insisting to be heard, who desires understanding of suffering’s genesis, and who acknowledges the ambiguity and ultimate mystery of the divine’s simultaneous presence and absence.</p>
<p>Although the prayerful tone of these final poems is filtered through a screen of lament, in both form and image these poems respond to the earlier poems of grief—poems of a certain kind of wilderness.  Considered as a group, the poems in this section are tighter metrically, and their stanzaic structures far more regular, than the poems in the first two sections.  They look and sound more solid.</p>
<p>The language of faith occurs early and often in the third section.  Wiman’s repetition of images to unify the collection, a device used to lesser effect in “Jouissance” and “It Takes Particular Clicks,” is particularly notable in the religious imagery found in “And I Said to My Soul, Be Loud.”  Following the wonderful description of his life as a “war in a jar,” the speaker exclaims</p>
<p>For I am come a whirlwind of wasted things<br />
and I will ride this tantrum back to God<br />
until my fixed self, my fluorescent self<br />
my grief-nibbling, unbewildered, wall-to-wall self<br />
withers in me like a salted slug</p>
<p>The connection between wind and the divine is biblical.  In II Kings, the prophet Elijah is taken into heaven in a whirlwind, and the breath of God – the <em>ruah Yahweh</em> – is a powerful Old Testament symbol of God’s presence and power.  Wiman employs this symbol in no fewer than four poems but varies its application, from a vehicle to God to a tool of divine agency, even a malignant one.</p>
<p>Religious belief emerges unmistakably in this final section.  Prayer is the dominant theme (“Hammer Is the Prayer,” “Small Prayer in a Hard Wind,” “Lord Is Not a Word” and “Lord of Having”).  In “When the Time’s Toxins,”</p>
<p>somehow a seed<br />
of belief</p>
<p>sprouts the instant<br />
I acknowledge it . . . .</p>
<p>This belief, however, is not an immature embrace of easy answers.  In “I Sing Insomnia,” the speaker struggles with purpose, grappling with his existential situation and finding his footing, though not a resting place, in religious faith and love.  The collection closes with “Gone for the Day, She Is the Day,” questioning the role of the divine and suggesting human love as an appropriate posture from which to face suffering and mortality:</p>
<p>Sometimes one has the sense<br />
that to say the name<br />
God is a great betrayal,</p>
<p>but whether one is betraying<br />
God, language, or one’s self<br />
is harder to say.</p>
<p>It is easier to admire <em>Every Riven Thing </em>than it is to like it.  In too many of these poems, Wiman indulges his own philosophical curiosity at the expense of his readers’ ability to participate emotionally; yet, the resulting emotional distance does not feel malicious.  Rather, one leaves these poems with a vague sense of relief that someone else has voiced the anxiety and doubt that one has been too timid, or too afraid, to express.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Borrower-Novel-Rebecca-Makkai/dp/0670022810"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-828" title="The Borrower Makkai" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/9902278-198x300.jpg" alt="" width="198" height="300" srcset="https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/9902278-198x300.jpg 198w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/9902278.jpg 314w" sizes="(max-width: 198px) 100vw, 198px" /></a>The concept of revolution is formed around and nuanced by abstract conceptions of change, of emotion, and of hope. Providing a succinct definition for such an intangible idea is a near impossible task. What makes a revolution? And, maybe more importantly, who makes a revolution? In her first novel, <em>The Borrower</em>, Rebecca Makkai tackles these questions as well as the more subtle themes of identity formation, the self-concept, and the possibilities of future generations. <em>The Borrower </em>is indeed the story of “a would-be revolutionary stuck at desk,” in other words, “a dormant volcano.” Exploring family, memory, and what it means to dream, Makkai uses straightforward yet somewhat psychological prose to create the story of a journey that is motivated by the impossible pursuit of knowing who you are and how you came to be that way. This very idea of the impossibility of knowing, of being able to grasp one’s self-concept, is reflected by the many surprises found throughout the novel, a feature of the story which makes it difficult to discuss without undermining the author’s strategy.</p>
<p>Reading and revolution are parallel strands in the novel. The novel’s protagonist, Lucy, is a librarian who comes from “a long line of revolutionaries.” Almost trying to escape the limitations of her Russian upbringing, and the secrecy thereof, Lucy takes a rebellious path that leads her to one of the least controversial places: the children’s section of a library. Facing a crisis of identity and the struggle to find out who she is as a result of where she came from, Lucy finds herself in a position many mid-to-late twenty-year-olds find themselves in. Graduating from college and striking out from home has not led Lucy to either an ideal life or a mature self-awareness, and the novel explores the ways in which people achieve a well-rounded perspective of who they are and who they want to be. Soon, Lucy looks to a person much younger than her to understand how to fashion an identity out of one’s dreams.</p>
<p>Lucy’s dynamic relationship with an intellectually curious, and possibly homosexual, ten-year-old boy ultimately leads to an unexpected kidnapping and a revelatory road trip. Bound up in this journey is the pervasive idea of freedom, and the possibility of earning freedom through a revolution of one’s own personal experience. Lucy constantly struggles to resolve her desire for “endless possibility” with her “librarian’s sensibility,” and her adventure with Ian only seems to upend her understanding of herself. However, Lucy is not the hero of this story, in fact, she “might be the villain.” At the core of the novel is Ian, a boy who is so full of potential and offers the possibility of what the life of a dreamer, and a revolutionary, could truly be like.</p>
<p>Ian’s family background is rather troubling. Struggling to find his expressive voice in his fundamentalist Christian home, this active mind finds freedom in the many books that he reads. For Ian, the library becomes a place not for escape, but rather, a sanctuary where he can broaden his scope of the world and develop his perspective of possibility. As Lucy fights to understand her past and sort out her present, Ian provides a sense of potential, and where revolution could lead. Furthermore, the hopeful future Ian represents is one that can be found in the everyday lives and experiences of normal people. Makkai unites the reader with Ian by demonstrating that, although his life has its own flaws and tragedies, these are not the tragedies of the heroes so often found in literature. Ian’s spirit of revolution and dreams of freedom are the dreams anyone who has ever experienced containment or limitation can recognize.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, Russian mobsters, a relentless ex-boyfriend, and a serious lack of money do not make Lucy and Ian’s quest any easier. Potential consequences of their journey always lurk in the back of Lucy’s head, from her fear of legal consequences to the ideological consequences of returning Ian to his overbearing parents and the troublesome Pastor Bob, Ian’s spiritual adviser and teacher of “anti-gay” classes. Although the novel pushes us into the microcosm of Ian and Lucy’s world, which seems safe and almost wholesome despite the illegality of the situation, it is impossible to forget the realities of the outside world, and the absurdity thereof. Throughout their quest Lucy has to develop a complex set of lies, and constantly has to answer questions about who she is and where she is going, and this inability to truly escape from the limitations of everyday life demonstrates an accountability to others that can be both nourishing and destructive.</p>
<p>Makkai employs mature techniques, imbuing each character with a well-developed complexity that forces the reader to constantly question and examine what it means to be a hero, a villain, a child, or a librarian. The depth given to each character allows the reader to wonder about the very nature of what makes a person moral, corrupt, or happy.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the narrative shape of the novel is almost cyclical, and the conclusion finds the reader returning to many of the themes and challenges presented at the start of this novel. Lucy’s struggles in the beginning of the novel remain persistent to the end. Revolution has to be read alongside this repetitive notion of time where “you can’t keep going, you can’t go back, and you can’t stay here.” Indeed, the novel itself does not remain self-contained. By the conclusion of the story the reader is left as unsure and wary of the future as Lucy. She thinks to herself, “What happy ending could I have been nursing, this whole time? It lurked there like a dream, half remembered. There was a picture from somewhere of a place I would take him, maybe a place from a book: a white-walled, sunny house where people took care of children, where they would explain everything and let him stay there forever or until he was strong enough to face his parents. Or we would all launch out together in our happy little boat and forge a new country on new land rising from the ocean foam: an ideal America finally again.” Urging a new evaluation of how to consider endings, happy or otherwise, Makkai hints that perhaps what is considered satisfactory in the present condition is just not enough.</p>
<p>Trying to understand what makes Lucy an admirable character is perhaps where Makkai’s strengths shine through. The push and pull between like and dislike, sympathizing and condemning, forced upon the reader reveals the complexity of Lucy and perhaps the complexity of all people living in the modern condition. Lucy’s story demonstrates the plethora of choices people make every day, and her mistakes show how incredibly important every choice can be. In many ways, <em>The Borrower </em>is a timeless story of human connection and impact, and how the choices we make can deeply affect others around us. It is Makkai’s astutely chosen words and her ability to weave themes that have always concerned the human condition that make <em>The Borrower</em> an excellent read for those who like to ask questions and those who appreciate the pursuit of finding answers.</p>
