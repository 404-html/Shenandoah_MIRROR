								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The older Girl Scouts kick out the screens of their bunkhouse at night and wander the open fields at the back part of the ranch.  They often walk down the dirt road my cabin is on to get to the horse pasture.  I can see them in the dark.  They move like timid deer &#8212; taking quick dashes ten yards at a time and stopping to assess the night around them.  They betray themselves by laughing when one bumps into the other.  I keep my porch light off so I can see the stars.  The girls never pay attention to my cabin tucked along the tree line or me on the deck as they line up along the fence, stepping on the first plank to lean over the top and coo to the horses.  They wave carrots and apples they&#8217;ve hoarded from the mess hall.  I like watching this &#8212; the slow saunter of the horses approaching and nuzzling the girls, their movements breaking the stillness of the night, fireflies touching the space around them like thin blue flames.</p>
<p>By morning, the undertow of the mountain will have pulled the girls back to their bunks, and the horses will be slick with dew, and honey-colored in the pasture.  The bear grass will bloom like fists of light pounding up the hillside, and by afternoon, rainstorms will darken the sky and strike the ground with lighting before blowing over and leaving this calm I have only felt in the mountains.</p>
<p>My boss Joe rents the horses from an outfit called Sombrero that lets them free-range in the mountains during the fall and winter.  The horses are all starved and half wild by spring when they come to the Girl Scout Ranch.  Joe had us wait by the horse trailers when they arrived to send back the ones we thought were too sick.  If we could fit a dime between its protruding ribs we wouldn&#8217;t let it off the trailer, and the ones we kept had to spend two weeks being retrained by the wrangler girls.    So when a wrangler calls this morning from the stable and says an old horse has died, Joe says, &#8220;You fellas misjudged one,&#8221; and we have to go out in the rain to get the dead horse before the campers see it.</p>
<p>Joe drives us to the pasture, which runs along an incline with a large cup of earth surrounded by lodgepole pines with rainwater pooling over the roots.  My coworker Kurt says that later in the summer the rain washes away the topsoil down to the clay, &#8220;and the clay gets slicker than snot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurt and I take the tractor into the pasture.  It&#8217;s slow going &#8212; the wheels can hardly catch in the mud.  Just into the trees lies a dark brown Quarter Horse.  Its head is sloped downwards enough to see a row of yellow headstone-shaped teeth.  Its unfurled tongue lies on the ground like a dull pink ladle.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d be better off just letting the mud swallow the damn thing,&#8221; Kurt yells over the engine noise.</p>
<p>The other horses are in the open part of the pasture. But the one they call  &#8220;All-But&#8221; is watching us through the trees.  All-But has everything but one eye.  The eye he has is a piercing cloudy blue.  That blue eye is on us as Kurt ties a sheepshank knot to bind the dead horse&#8217;s back legs together.  He hooks a chain to the knotted rope and loops the chain on the back of the tractor where I stand as Kurt drives.  He eases the tractor forward slowly so he won&#8217;t tear off the legs.  When the chain is taut, he leans on the gas, and the old horse pivots from the pot of earth it died in.  Once we get it out of the trees it starts sliding easily over the wet mud.  As it runs over jagged rocks I notice chunks of the hide and meaty patches of the horse&#8217;s side left behind.  Joe holds the gate open for us so none of the other horses can get out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drag it as far into the woods as you can, and toss some brush cover over it,&#8221; Joe says.  He has on a mesh baseball cap and the beads of rain are running down the back of his neck.  The cold does not change his posture or his directness.  He seems like he&#8217;s done everything a hundred times.  Kurt drives past the horse barn toward the woods, away from the little girls&#8217; cabins.  On the gravel and root path going east along the mountain, the horse&#8217;s body gets caught on a broken root that gouges under its ribcage and snares it like a fishhook.  We change the knot and tie another one to its front feet to pull it loose.  Dragging it by the front leaves the head swinging backward at an awful angle, and I watch the neck snap as we drive, making a quick &#8220;pop&#8221; that breaks through the steady tractor noise.</p>
<p>Where the gravel road opens up into a small field, a group of girls hiking single file between two counselors emerge from the woods bordering the camp property.  They all stare with big open mouths at what we&#8217;re dragging until the counselors make them turn their backs to us like they do on the road when we pass, so our truck doesn&#8217;t throw dust in their face.  As the tractor passes them I see how the rain slides off their hoods in little rivulets, and I hope none of them turn around to look at the horse again.</p>
<p>We untie it in the woods at the end of the camp property.  The hide has been scraped raw, and the last ten yards of mud we move it through is blood-smeared.  This high up there is too much bedrock to bury it, so we use jigsaws to cut away at the surrounding trees&#8217; lowest branches and pile them over the horse until we can no longer see its mangled form.  Part of me feels like we should light the pile on fire.  I ride on the back of the tractor as we return the way we came.  The last of the rain washes the copper-red blood marks and clumps of horse fur away from the trail.  The sun is breaking through the clouds.  Sunlight gushes up the hillside as if trying to memorize the contours of every jagged stone.  Already turkey vultures are flying in wide spirals above the slope we left the horse on, the black finger of their beaks tracing the mountainside.  The birds cut through the sky like they are scrolling something on the mountain&#8217;s thermal updrafts &#8212; a language of nature&#8217;s neatness, its cycles, of wind speaking of life on the mountain.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cal said come to the Neshoba County Fair, so Virginia is here, bathed in the garish light of the midway. The night air is thick with the rancid meat smell of too much warm breath, too many unwashed bodies packed close all around. Some brush against her as they pass, their skin hot and slick, and she crosses her arms over her chest, presses her fingers against the knobs of her shoulders. If only there were something she could throw over herself &#8212; a shawl, a shroud. Something heavy to weigh her down because she is too light, as if she has shed whole pounds in the last few hours. As if a part of her has gone missing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“What next?” she says to Cal, who has joined her in the midway, a beer &#8212; not his first &#8212; in his hand.</p>
<p>“Come and play a game,” Cal says. He heads off down the midway, and she has no choice but to follow. It is late July; it is Mississippi and Neshoba so fired up with liquor and love that the heat is tangible, alive, some monstrous thing with outspread wings pulsing down on them. Maybe she shouldn’t have come. Her first real outing in months and she should’ve started with a movie, a simple dinner out, a neighborhood park. Something lighter, something less gorged with noise and light and motion. She’s not used to all this walking, all this open air against the bare skin of her arms, her legs. What she’s used to is her cramped, two-room apartment back in Jackson where, for weeks now, she has sat for hours on end in the same position: cross-legged on the couch, a laptop on her thighs and her quick, lynx-like fingers pouncing on the keyboard, ripping over the keys &#8212; a hundred words per minute! &#8212; for this man sucking down a cheap beer beside her.</p>
<p>It’s because of him that she’s here, that she rode the hour and a half up to Neshoba in his lumbering white convertible. “A 1961 Pontiac,” he told her. “Get your feet off the dash.” Her feet weren’t on the dash. They were resting properly on the floorboard, but Cal pays no mind to details. Like when he showed up this afternoon on her doorstep in a clean, collared shirt and said, “Wash up. We got somewhere to be.” He hadn’t noticed then that she was already washed, that she’d smoothed back all her wild, curly hair, that she was dressed in a yellow cotton sundress (her mother’s, and she’d had to dig through four boxes just to find it). Nor did he notice that her bag was packed and sitting at her feet where she waited by the window, twisting the curtains in her hands. But then, Cal has no reason to notice these things. He is not her lover, not really her friend. Just a man who pays her to take notes, a man she has known only a few months, a drunk, a liar, and when he suggested this outing, when he asked her if she’d like to take a break from her note-taking, have some fun, she should have known better.</p>
<p>She does know better, in fact. But what choice does she have? She lost her job. She was forced to find a new one. She found Cal &#8212; or rather, he found her. It’s all her mother’s fault, really, like everything else. How easy it is to blame the absent, the vanished.</p>
<p>THEY MOVE THROUGH the crowd, the swirling light and noise, the shrill laughter and hoarse voices calling to them, to anyone: “Where you going, little mama? First toss is free!” Or, “I’d win you a pony, if you was mine. Come on back here, sugar.” It’s worse, for women, harder to say no. She would stop, if not for Cal. If not for Cal leading her on, she would be forced to obey these voices. She wouldn’t be able to help it.</p>
<p>They pick their way through sawdust sticky with spilled soda and vomit. They dodge clumps of manure and scraps of food &#8212; syrup-soaked biscuits and fried dough and smatterings of powdered sugar. The flies are everywhere; they come buzzing up around Virginia’s head, and she waves them away, forgets to watch where she walks and steps in an overturned cup of dip spit, which she doesn’t notice until they stop beside a small red tent with a sign: Cassandra, Ancient Palm-Reader.</p>
<p>“Is this next?” Virginia says.</p>
<p>“No.” Cal points to a sign one tent over. See the Walking Corpse of Neshoba County! the sign says, in thick black letters. And because Cal wants to, they will.</p>
<p>Four dollars a piece but, “She’s worth every penny,” says the man out front.</p>
<p>Inside, the tent is dim, lit red from the bulbs that line the big glass case in front of them. Inside the glass is a woman sitting on a stool, her legs crossed like a lady. An overhead light blinks on, throwing a blue beam over the woman’s legs, which appear normal enough to Virginia &#8212; nice, actually, smooth and toned. But, “that ain’t right,” Cal says, pointing at the woman’s feet, and Virginia sees that she is toe-less, the blue-lit flesh of her feet running off into nothing, into black. Another light blinks on, aimed at the woman’s hands, resting calmly in her lap, and it’s the same as the feet &#8212; the fingers missing, the hands ending at the knuckles, like balled fists almost &#8212; but when she flips them over, palm up, there’s nothing but smooth skin. Cartoon hands, round and seamless and incomplete.</p>
<p>“I got news for you,” Cal says to the man. “That ain’t a corpse.”</p>
<p>“No, sir,” the man says. “She’s even better. Watch this,” and at his cue, lights in all different colors illuminate the woman’s arms, her shoulders. “Look there,” the man says. “See that spot there beneath her elbow?” Virginia does see &#8212; a large, round area at the top of the woman’s forearm that, even as they watch, appears to be slowly vanishing, color and density fading out, fading into black.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with her?” Cal says.</p>
<p>“We’re not real sure,” the man says. “But whatever it is, it’s spreading.”</p>
<p>“Remember this, Ginny,” Cal says to Virginia. “So you can write it down later.”</p>
<p>But she’d prefer to forget.</p>
<p>IT WOULD BE easier for her to enjoy herself if she could shut off all those words running through her head, as if on loop. Not the sound of the words, not the voices, but the image of them on a page or a screen: small black letters, double-spaced with standard margins, standard blankness, one inch at the top and bottom, one inch on either side. Neat and tidy and always the same, always there. There must have been a time when they weren’t there, when she could see images, scenes, whole pictures, rather than just the letters themselves.</p>
<p>And they’re never her own words, always someone else’s. Most recently, they are Cal’s, his stories for her to type up, put together, make whole. Memoirs, he calls them, though he can’t be much more than thirty, no older than she is and too young for a real past. And most of what he tells her, she suspects, are lies. “I busted into a zoo,” he said once. “Stole the panther right from its cage.” Or, “One time, I blacked out for three whole weeks,” he told her. “When I came to, I was at Graceland.” He laughed then, and shook the hair from his eyes. “Imagine that, Ginny. I’d been making like I worked there, showing around the tourists.” And another time, very late at night when he was six or seven drinks in, “I stole a man down in Lucedale,” he said. “He was crazy as a loon, and I sold him to science. You wouldn’t believe all the things I done.”</p>
<p>She doesn’t believe, but doesn’t say so. She sits there, on the couch in her apartment where they do this work, a cup of coffee on the floor at her feet and a keyboard propped on her knees. She sits there, and she looks at him, at his unwashed hair that he tucks behind his ears, at his yellow-brown eyes, at the pale stubble above his lip and the dime-sized mole, dark and bristly, on his left cheek. She looks because it’s called for, because “It’s American,” her mother taught her, when she was a child. Her mother’s parents had come from Lebanon, but her mother was born “right smack in the middle of Alabama,” and never let anyone forget it. “In America,” she would say, “you look people in the eye, or they’ll think you’re scared of them. You look at people when they talk to you.” And Cal is always talking.</p>
<p>But, “Stop eyeing me and write that down,” he will say, breaking off mid-sentence. “What am I paying you for?”</p>
<p>Whatever it is, he isn’t paying much. A lot less, in fact, than she made typing for the doctors at St. Dymphna’s, where she’d been fired. And at St. Dymphna’s, she’d had health insurance, retirement, a bi-monthly paycheck rather than a fistful of damp, crumpled cash. But, for all that, she finds she doesn’t miss it. She doesn’t miss coiffing her hair every morning, sitting with her legs crossed like a lady at her desk. Nor does she miss the doctors and their jargon, words like diagnosis and malingering and psychosis that, by the time she left, were becoming more than letters on a page, were taking on real heft and bulk. The worst of these words, the most unwieldy, was the patient &#8212; always, in everything, the patient, the patient, over and over until she found herself jotting it down on napkins during her lunch breaks, or drumming it out against the table like it was a keyboard.</p>
<p>It made her tired, dragging those words along everywhere she went. So tired, finally, that she was sure her own mother had walked up to her desk and asked to have herself committed. Her mother, who’d disappeared six years ago, who’d taken the car and the big leather trunk that had held her grandmother’s trousseau and had left everything else behind &#8212; her jewelry and her boxes of letters and cards (some of them from her sisters, a note from Virginia in her crooked, childish handwriting: Happy Fourth of July!!!), her pretty, high-heeled shoes lined in rows at the bottom of the closet, and all the rest that Virginia had packed up and stored at her own apartment when the house went into foreclosure.</p>
<p>And here she was – her mother &#8212; this woman at Virginia’s desk with black hair and oily, olive skin and that look on her face &#8212; so familiar &#8212; the expression she used whenever one of her daughters questioned her, the firm, defensive mouth, black eyes askance. Gripping the edge of the desk with one hand and rummaging (always, she was rummaging) through her bag with the other, she whipped a license from her wallet &#8212; fake, it must have been &#8212; tapped the photo and, “You don’t understand,” the woman said, in her mother’s deep voice. “I don’t exist. I’m not real.”</p>
<p>“It was her,” Virginia told her sisters, over the phone.</p>
<p>“You’re tired,” they said.</p>
<p>“She pretended not to know me. But it was her.”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t her.”</p>
<p>Three months later, Virginia is still not sure.</p>
<p>AHEAD, CHILDREN ARE gambling. A boy stands atop a box at the roulette wheel, several bills fanned out on the table in front of him. Other boys crowd the table, their gap-toothed grins showing pink gums and tongues stained bright blue or red or green. There’s a girl squeezed in among them, her elbows propped on the table and her chin in her hands, a lot of orange-red hair falling over her face. She’s maybe eleven, twelve, with sleepy, half-closed eyes, and she curls her lip when Cal throws a wad of cash onto the table beside her. The boy-dealer hesitates only seconds before he sweeps the money into the cash box and pushes the chips at Cal.</p>
<p>“You play against children?” Virginia says. But she isn’t there to ask questions. And despite what Cal told her, she isn’t there to have fun &#8212; something she realized as soon as they arrived, when he slipped a notepad and a pen into her bag because “You never know what might happen.” She knew then why he brought her: so she could take note of what he does, in case he forgets.</p>
<p>“I want you to pay real close attention,” Cal says. “Burn this in your memory.”</p>
<p>So she bites her bottom lip and squints at the roulette table to reassure him, because she can’t lose this job, too; she can’t lose Cal. He’s not safe, she knows that. She knew it when she first met him, before he told her all his embellished past. She could tell by the look of him, by his thrown-on air, so disheveled and temporary, transient. Like he’s perpetually passing through, like every night is his first, or his last, and tomorrow he’ll be on his way somewhere better than Jackson, or Neshoba, better than all of the shadow that is Mississippi. At any moment, he could slip away. But when, late at night, he stretches his legs out over her couch, shakes his glass so that the ice tinkles and looks sideways at her with his yellow-brown eyes, she finds it comforting to write him into his stories, pin him down, diminish him to letters, symbols, words that she can organize and stow away. That, later, she knows just where to find.</p>
<p>The boy spins the wheel and the number is fourteen. Cal’s number. “No candy or whores for you,” he says, as he takes their money. One of the children has bet with a box of taffy, and Cal takes that, too. “Buck up,” he says to the woebegone faces, the stifled tears. “This ain’t a playground.” Then, “You got this, Ginny?” he says. “You paying attention?”</p>
<p>The orange-haired girl pushes back from the table. “I’m a fortune-teller,” she says.  “Mama says that’s different, but I think it’s sort of the same as a whore.” She glances up at them, at Cal, then Virginia and says, “I know what you’re up to.”  She wobbles for a moment, one hand over her mouth like she’s about to vomit, then she turns and disappears in the crowd.</p>
<p>“Who did she mean?” Virginia says. “You or me?”</p>
<p>“She’s drunk, is all.” Cal folds the money into his wallet &#8212; homemade with duct tape that he’d filched off his buddy, he told her &#8212; and tucks the wallet and the box of taffy into the bag slung over his shoulder. The bag is hers, and when he’d offered to carry it, she’d thought he was being gentlemanly. But now, she suspects he knew all along he’d fill the bag with money and candy and other loot he doesn’t trust her with, not the least of which are the keys to his precious Pontiac, jingling at the bottom.</p>
<p>She stares up at his long, narrow face, his sun-roughened skin and wonders if she would recognize him in a crowd. He looks so much like all the other cleaned-up men in jeans and button-down shirts, their sleeves rolled up over their tanned forearms and their hair combed back. How easy it would be for Cal to slip among them, to vanish for good.</p>
<p>“Don’t call me Ginny,” she says, though she knows he won’t listen; he won’t obey. It is always she who obeys him. It is always her bowing to his will, because what else does she have to do?  “Plenty,” her mother would tell her, if she were here. “A woman,” she would say, “should always have too much to do.” And yet, Virginia can remember the times when her mother did nothing, when she sat at the kitchen table with her hands twisted together in her lap to hide the raw, bleeding places where she’d picked the skin from her fingertips and her knuckles. Virginia can remember, and even worse is that, lately, Virginia has caught herself in the same posture. Hunched over the trunk she uses as a coffee table, her hands clenched together and her fingers &#8212; her long, slender fingers that she can never keep still &#8212; squirming like blind newborns, like the bald baby squirrels she finds fallen from the trees in her yard. And when she catches herself, she knows how she looks. Just like her mother, without the blood.</p>
<p>THEY TURN DOWN Happy Hollow, a cabin street nearly as crowded as the midway, with the cabins built close together and people spilling from porches into a narrow lane strewn with empty bottles and brightly colored children’s toys and pinwheels stuck here and there, spinning in the breeze of the outdoor fans. They’re all the same, these cabins, painted gaudy colors, bright blue, purple, yellow, red. All of them tall and skinny, their porches done up with string lights and American flags. Her mother would approve of the flags &#8212; so patriotic.<br />
Virginia is careful to keep to the middle of the lane, just out of reach of the cabin over-flow: the women draped over porch chairs and showing too much flesh in their tank tops and rolled-up shorts. Sticky-looking flesh, like if Virginia were to touch it, it would cling to her finger. And the men, slumped at their feet or on the porch steps, most of them shirtless, many picking guitars, some of them singing. The din of out-of-tune chords and harsh, slurred voices blends with the screams from the midway, the calling of the vendors, the music pumped through overhead speakers. They’re on fair grounds, but it’s like they’ve turned a corner and ended up in some tawdry village from a second-rate fairy tale.</p>
<p>These people &#8212; the villagers, she thinks of them &#8212; look up as she and Cal pass. Some call to her. “Where you staying, baby?” says a man with a shadowed face and deeply socketed eyes. “Come on back and sit a while.” It’s like a game, sticking to the middle of the lane, a game from childhood that she can almost recall &#8212; Valley of Death? &#8212; and if she steps just an inch more to the left or the right, one of them will grab her, draw her in and she will lose. Cal is playing, too, because he walks a straight line down the middle, just in front of her.</p>
<p>“Where are we going?” Virginia says.</p>
<p>He turns to face her. “To find a place to stay,” he says, his voice low. “Now, act like you belong.” Then he steps sideways out of the lane and into the arms of a fat, grinning woman.</p>
<p>CAL IS A big man, over six feet with a broad chest and an oversized head like a mastiff’s. But this woman, all her sun-burnt fat pillowing out from her tube top &#8212; this woman engulfs him. She wraps him up in a hug and whole parts of him, his face and his long, muscled back, disappear beneath all that flesh. So much flesh that it can’t all be her own, and Virginia, planted safe in the middle of the lane, runs her fingers over her stomach and below the hem of her dress to her bare thighs, as if making sure she’s all there. It’s the walking corpse she thinks of. How unfair it is that this fat woman should have so much extra, while back there behind the glass a poor, sick woman has less and less.</p>
<p>The missing fingers bother Virginia the most. Extremities, doctors call those. They’d love to get their hands on the walking corpse, all those doctors at St. Dymphna’s. They’d love to prove that it’s all in her head and her fingers and toes are there, if she’d only listen to them and take her medication. So smug, every one of them, so judgmental, because that’s what a diagnosis is, Virginia has learned, a judgment. A classic schizoid, they would scribble at the bottom of the charts. Text-book bi-polar. Borderline PS with typical paranoid tendencies. It was always the same, the same four or five diagnoses over and over until Virginia wondered if this was it, all there was to people, and, if so, which type was she?  She greeted these patients. She signed them in, knew their names. They were real, with all three dimensions, front, back and side, but to Virginia, their charts tucked neatly into files and their histories typed in tidy rows across clean white paper, each of them had the pressed, glossy quality of figures in a magazine. Like she could flip them with a finger, and they’d be gone.</p>
<p>“Come on, Ginny,” Cal says. The fat woman has him propped against the porch railing, and she’s running her fingers through his hair. On the porch behind them, among the lounging bodies and the out-flung limbs, are a group of small girls sitting cross-legged in a circle. One of them looks up, looks right at Virginia with heavy, bloodshot eyes &#8212; the girl from the roulette table. Virginia ducks her head, glances quickly away (it’s not polite to stare, her mother also taught her, and “Stop asking questions,” she said, when Virginia wanted to know how staring was any different from looking someone in the eye when they spoke to you). But she can feel the girl’s eyes on her, even when she has turned away. She can feel that girl, her gaze blank and calm as a corpse.</p>
<p>“What the fuck are you doing?” Cal says. “You’re blocking the lane.”</p>
<p>“That’s okay, baby.” A man steps around from behind her, a metal trash can in his arms. He sets it down at the foot of the porch steps, pulls off the lid. The inside, lined in plastic, is full of a dark, purplish liquid. “Have a drink,” the man says, dipping a paper cup into the can.</p>
<p>She shouldn’t. She rarely drinks. But she’s here, and there’s no going back, not without Cal, who’s beckoning to her from the porch. She can’t go up there, can’t act like she belongs without a little help, something to calm her. So she takes the cup, throws her head back and swallows the liquid all at once. It’s sweet, like Kool-Aid, with the sharp, medicinal aftertaste of some kind of alcohol. But not bad, and she takes a second cup, sips.  Something tickles her thigh. She lifts the hem of her skirt, and a black insect flies out. It lands on the sawdust a few feet away &#8212; a cricket, it looks like, or a large fly. How long had it been there? She rubs her thigh with her fingers and wonders if there are more up there that she can’t feel, crawling up and down her skin.</p>
<p>CAL COMES BARRELING down the porch steps and grabs her by the hand. It is the first time he has touched her, and his hand is cool and soft &#8212; softer than a man’s should be, a man like him. He pulls her up the steps and plunges them both among the mass of bodies and coolers and bottles and empty plates that cover every inch of the porch. The odor  is strong enough to taste &#8212; a stewed, over-cooked smell, like road-kill baking in sun. She’d like to cover her mouth with her hand to keep it back, to keep from breathing it down inside her. But Cal holds her from behind, his arms wrapped tight around hers as he pushes her along in front of him.</p>
<p>“You’re crushing me.”</p>
<p>“You’re embarrassing me.” He drops his head down over her shoulder, and his stubble tickles her cheek. “Now shape up and be good.” He squeezes her so tight that his pulse, the steady beat of his blood, thumps against her back.</p>
<p>“Let go,” she says, but she’d rather he didn’t. He’s solid and big, and he tethers her here, keeps her firmly on the ground. Without him, she would bounce around this place like a balloon. She would float at random, a fluff of hair, detached from its body, borne about by the wind. She tries to picture this image, tries to see herself as light as she feels &#8212; so light, like she’s fading away, being rubbed out, bleached like a stain.</p>
<p>“Why’s your mouth all purple?” Cal says, and the image is gone.</p>
<p>He pulls her along to the fat woman who stands at the threshold of the cabin door. “Is that your sweetheart?” the woman says.</p>
<p>“When she’s good. This is Rita,” Cal says, nodding at the fat woman.</p>
<p>The woman grins at Virginia. “Aren’t you pretty? Did you know, honey,” she says, “that he says he’s my brother and I didn’t recognize him?” Up close, her face is unnaturally smooth and without pores, as if covered in a layer of enamel. Nothing at all like Cal’s rough, uneven complexion. “I haven’t seen him in ten years,” she says. “I’m his sister, for Christ’s sake.”</p>
<p>Virginia hasn’t seen her own sisters for six years now, since they’d shown up to go through their mother’s things after she’d disappeared, when it was clear she wasn’t coming back. And she’s not sure what to say to this woman, so she says, “You don’t look like Cal,” and Cal’s hand clamps down on her shoulder.</p>
<p>“Listen, honey,” the woman says, “it ain’t my fault. I’ve been trying to find him. And he won’t tell me what he’s been up to. All he says is that I’ll find out soon enough.” She taps Cal’s chest with her finger. “What in heaven’s name does that mean?”</p>
<p>Virginia could tell her. She could offer up her files, her pages and pages of notes. All typed up, printed out and neatly stacked in the bottom of her panty drawer. Stowed away, out of sight, but still she sees them &#8212; the small, black letters running left to right, left to right, forming words meant to convey images: Cal posing as a magician in a jazz bar on Decatur Street, and Cal running naked through a swamp down in Pass Christian with the mud caked on his calves thick as leather chaps. But vividly as he describes these scenes, all Virginia ever sees are the shapes of the letters, the curving S’s and round O’s, the sharp points of a W or a capital A. Running through her head, spreading down a smooth, white page so much faster than she can type, left to right, down, down, so fast it makes her dizzy, and she steadies herself against Cal.</p>
<p>“Is she drunk?” Rita says.</p>
<p>“Ain’t everybody?”</p>
<p>“Well, she’s so skinny,” Rita says. “Probably doesn’t take much.”</p>
<p>“I’m not drunk,” Virginia says, but maybe she is, because the noise, the laughter, the screams and Rita’s fat, rich voice come in bursts, in pops and stutters, like a radio scanning stations. And the string lights on the railing appear to be melting, white light dripping down like wax. She turns away, closes her eyes and when she opens them, she catches the gaze from the opposite corner, two huge, light eyes aimed at her, piercing her, like they see, they know and they aren’t telling.</p>
<p>INSIDE, UPSTAIRS WHERE she lies on a thin blanket, Cal says, “You got to remember to write this down.” He sits beside her, his back propped against the wall. “Write down,” he says, “how the typist went into a swoon, like a lady in one of those movies, and how I carried her inside, like a hero.”</p>
<p>“That’s not what happened.”</p>
<p>“Write down,” he says, “how I saved her and how she was so grateful, she cried like a little girl.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t.”</p>
<p>“Well,” he says, “it’d be more interesting if you did.”</p>
<p>It’s dark in this room, hard to make him out. There are others in here, bodies they’d stumbled over on their way in, some asleep and snoring, others pawing at one another.  The rustle of sheets, the whispering and the heavy, drunken breathing seems all around, behind, beside, above her. Or is that her making that faint rippling sound, like the purring of a cat?</p>
<p>She sits up, her head spinning. The front of her dress is wet, stained purple from the drink she spilled. Her mother’s dress and twenty years old at least, but when Virginia cleaned out her mother’s closet, she found it hanging there in perfect condition, as if waiting for her mother to slip it back on.</p>
<p>“Get comfortable,” Cal says. “We’re staying the night.”</p>
<p>“Together?” She can’t imagine sleeping beside him. She can’t imagine him asleep at all. She wonders if he snores.</p>
<p>“Don’t get worked up,” he says. “I’ll keep my pants on.”</p>
<p>For a while, he’s quiet, which is odd, and she thinks he has fallen asleep. But then there’s the pop of a can opening, the soft fizz of foam, and when she turns to look, she can make out his long, dark shape where he sits against the wall.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” she asks him.</p>
<p>“Planning.”</p>
<p>Virginia sits up, faces him and, in a half-whisper, the words thrumming in her throat, finds herself telling him about her mother. She must be drunk, giddy, because she’s never told him anything before. He’s never asked.</p>
<p>“Did you look for her?” he says.</p>
<p>“I don’t think she wanted to be looked for.”</p>
<p>“I mean that second time. After she came back. Did you go after her? That’s what I’d do, if someone took off on me.”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t,” Virginia says. “They said it wasn’t her. They didn’t know who it was. What could I do?” She could stare, as it turned out, because that’s what she did. She gaped up at the woman for so long that, finally, the woman had stomped off past her, through the door to the patients’ wing. And even then, even when she had gone, Virginia sat at her desk, her hands clasped together to still her wriggling fingers and her mind, as if at a loss for any other way to make sense of what she’d just seen, spitting out letters: the cupped u of understand, the curled tail of the apostrophe in I’m, the crossed-hatched x and the tiny dot over the i in exist. That’s what she saw; that’s what she was still seeing when her mother reappeared with a doctor beside her, when they walked out the door of the building and disappeared.</p>
<p>“If it’d been me,” Cal says, “I would’ve followed her right out that door. I would’ve followed her till she owned up to who she was.”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t follow her,” Virginia says. “She didn’t want me to.” But she should have done something, acted in some way. She should have stood up at her desk and shouted “Mom, Mom, Mom,” or tried it in Arabic, “Ummu, Ummu, Ummu,” because her mother hated Arabic, and that would’ve been sure to piss her off, to get her attention. Because that was the worst of it, how she’d looked right at Virginia, right into her eyes, and didn’t seem to know her at all.</p>
<p>“Who gives a fuck what she wanted?” Cal says. “Sometimes, Ginny, you got to do what you want. Fuck everybody else.” He stretches out on the floor.</p>
<p>After a while, “Was that really your sister?” Virginia says. “That big woman down there?”</p>
<p>But he must be asleep already, because he doesn’t answer.</p>
<p>WHEN VIRGINIA WAKES up, the room is still dark, and Cal is gone. She throws her arm out over the blanket, gropes along the bare floor. It’s warm, as if he’d lain there only seconds ago. Her bag is gone, too, her bag with his money, his keys. But he can’t have deserted her. Why would he? It makes no sense; she’s got all his files, all his notes, his whole goddamned past. Surely, he’ll be right back. But her fingers pick at the blanket, twist and tug and want to claw right through.</p>
<p>She rises to her knees. From all around, from every corner, comes the sound of sleep, breath sucking in and out, steady and monotonous as the hum of an air conditioner. She tries to be still, to let the sound wash over her, lull her into submission, because what she wants to do is run from the room and out onto the porch and to wherever it is that Cal has gone. But that would be silly, because he’s probably only gone to the bathroom, or maybe to the kitchen &#8212; does this place have a kitchen? &#8212; to root for a snack. Or maybe he’s hunting up more loot, finding things he’d like to steal. She wouldn’t care. She wouldn’t care if he stripped the whole place down to nothing, as long as he came back.</p>
<p>But he does not come back. She sits there, picking at the blanket until she’s pulled the thread out from the hem. Then she stretches her stiff legs, smoothes her hair back with her fingers and goes to look for him.</p>
<p>The staircase is dark, so she clings to the railing &#8212; a rough, wooden rod that pricks her palm &#8212; until she reaches the bottom floor. There’s a light coming from a corner, a tiny gleam. She moves toward it, but halfway there, she stops. Just above the light, lit up from its blue-white glow, hovers the face of the red-haired girl.</p>
<p>“What do you want?” the girl says. It’s a book light that she’s got, stuck into the spine of a paperback.</p>
<p>“Have you seen that man?” Virginia says. “The tall man I was with before?”</p>
<p>The girl snaps the light off, and the room goes black. Virginia is aware, suddenly, of how dry her mouth is. “Could you turn that back on?” she says.</p>
<p>“I seen him,” the girl says, into the dark. “I know where he’s gone.”</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>When the girl answers, her voice is much closer. So close that her breath, cool and odorless, touches Virginia’s face. “He’s gone to fuck my mother.”</p>
<p>Something sharp pokes Virginia in the side, and she realizes that she has stumbled sideways against a table corner. “Turn the light back on,” she says.</p>
<p>The girl’s hand, hot and wiry, closes on her arm. “I’ll prove it,” she says. “I’ll show you.”</p>
<p>The child is crazy, probably, some backwoods offspring of the Delta. Or drunk, maybe even stoned. Virginia should shake her off, go back upstairs, wait for Cal to come back. If he’d wanted her to follow him, he would’ve told her. But, as if sucked into a current, she finds herself following this girl out onto the porch, down the porch steps and into the lane.</p>
<p>Outside, it is lighter, all the string lights and neon cutting through the dark. It must be far past midnight, and the crowd has thinned along Happy Hollow. Those still awake slump in lawn chairs, cups in their hands. Some have dragged blankets and sleeping bags out onto the porches. Ahead, a bare-chested man in torn jeans sprawls across the lane. There’s blood on his face, and a broken bottle clutched in his hand. “He’s okay,” the girl says, and they step over him.</p>
<p>They reach another cabin street &#8212; Sunset Lane, according to the sign &#8212; and turn right.</p>
<p>“Listen,” Virginia says. “Do you know Cal?”</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>“The man. The man you’re taking me to.”</p>
<p>“No.” The girl pushes the mess of hair back from her face. “But when I seen him, I knew right off what he was up to,” she says. “I knew what he wanted. And she promised! She promised she wouldn’t whore herself out no more.”</p>
<p>“How did you know?”</p>
<p>The girl stops in front of a bright blue cabin. She turns her face up to Virginia. “I know lots of things,” she says. This close, her eyes are a strange, pale gray, enormous and wavering, as if magnified through water. She points at the blue cabin. “They’re in there,” she says. “Go on.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you coming?” She can’t go in there without the girl to guide her.</p>
<p>“You think I want to see that?” the girl says. “I seen enough of that. I don’t want to see no more.”</p>
<p>But Virginia does. It boils up from the pit of her stomach, this sudden, overwhelming desire to witness Cal in the act. From what he’s told her, he’s been with a woman from every family in Jackson, but Virginia can never picture it. She can never picture any of his stories, or anything else for that matter, and this time there will be more than words for her type, more than the shapes and symbols. This time, she’ll see it for herself, whether he likes it or not.</p>
<p>IT’S DIM INSIDE the cabin, and so quiet a that at first she thinks the girl has tricked her, that there’s no one here. But then, from upstairs, comes a dull thud, like a fist pounding the wall, and then another thud, thud, thud. Virginia moves toward the noise, but half-way up the stairs the sound of Cal’s voice, high and cracked, makes her pause: “Goddamn liar!” he shouts. “Fuck you! Fuck you!” She has never heard him like this, and she waits for him to say something else. But he doesn’t, so she moves on.</p>
<p>When she reaches the landing, she doesn’t have to go far, because there’s an open door to the left, and with a lot of light spilling out into the narrow hall. Inside the room, bathed in all that bright light, is Cal. He’s half naked, Virginia’s bag slung over his bare shoulder, his boots and shirt clutched to his chest. His hair, stiff with the pomade he’d used to slick it back, juts in crazy spikes all over his head, and his face is contorted with emotion &#8212; his lip curled, jaw clenched, all the tendons in his neck standing out. He’s glaring at a woman &#8212; the girl’s mother, it must be, the same red hair – who’s stretched naked on a tiny cot, her white legs dangling over the edge and onto the floor. There’s something familiar about those legs, and Virginia feels as if she has seen them before, has examined their length and shape.</p>
<p>“Five hundred dollars!” Cal says. “For what? To fuck a regular woman, when I could buy that for fifty.” He is out of breath, his words coming out with loud puffs of air. “I want a refund. I want every penny of it back.”</p>
<p>“Why?” the woman says. She sits up, pulling the sheet to her chest.</p>
<p>“You fucking lied to me. That’s why.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t lie.”</p>
<p>Cal stomps barefoot over to the cot. He grabs the woman’s ankle and lifts her foot. “What’s this?” he says. “Your goddamn toes, that’s what.” He drops her foot and reaches for her hand. “And those are your fucking fingers. One, two, three, four, five of them. I paid to fuck something special. A vanishing woman is what I paid for.”</p>
<p>Virginia knows now where she has seen those legs. But the last time, they hadn’t ended in curled pink toes.</p>
<p>“Go ahead,” the woman says. “Squeeze as hard as you can. Break my hand, if you want. I can’t feel it.”</p>
<p>Cal throws her hand aside and stoops to pull his boots on.</p>
<p>“Smash my toes with your heel,” the woman says. “Go on. Burn me with a cigarette. Hell, stick a knife through my palm. It doesn’t matter.”</p>
<p>“You’re fucking crazy,” Cal says, and then, without warning, he comes barreling out the door. Virginia has just enough time to duck back into the dark hall as he rushes past. She waits for the clomp of his boots to fade off down the stairs, waits for the porch door to slam, and then, slowly, she stretches her neck out to peek inside the bedroom.</p>
<p>The woman, the walking corpse, stands in full view of the doorway, the sheet wrapped around her. “What do you want?” she says, and Virginia freezes there, caught in her crouch.</p>
<p>“I see you,” the woman says. She gathers up the bottom of the sheet and walks to the doorway. “Get up,” she says, standing over Virginia. “Get up. You look ridiculous.”</p>
<p>For a moment, Virginia only blinks up at her. Then, she stands and smoothes her dress down as best she can.</p>
<p>“You were with him before, in the tent,” the woman says. “What are you &#8212; his girlfriend?” They stand close together in the doorway. The woman has the same pale gray eyes as her daughter, the same magnified effect. But her mouth, plump and pink, is less sneering, less hard.</p>
<p>“No,” Virginia says. “I’m his typist.”</p>
<p>“Whatever.” She flips her hair over her shoulder, more dignified, in her sheet, than Virginia fully dressed. “He’s just like the rest of them.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>The woman holds up her hand, palm out, fingers spread. “Because he can see it,” she says. “He thinks it’s there.” She steps through the doorway into the hall. “Move back,” she says, and then grips the door frame with one hand, and with the other, pulls the door shut on her fingers. It bounces back from the impact, and when she holds her fingers up for Virginia to see, a purple groove runs across the knuckles, and three of the nails have torn off.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with you?” Virginia says.</p>
<p>“Nothing,” says the woman. “It’s just, I’m starting to not exist.” Then she backs through the doorway into the room. “Now get the hell out,” she says and slams the door in Virginia’s face.</p>
<p>BACK ON SUNSET Lane, beneath the light of the Japanese lanterns strung overhead, Virginia pauses to brush herself off. The walking corpse was right: she looks ridiculous. A thirty-year-old woman, her knees dirty with floor grit, sawdust clinging to her sandals, stuck between her toes. Hair probably a mess, too, beginning to frizz. And worst of all, her mother’s dress is stained purple across the bodice. She spreads the skirt with her hands, tries to remember her mother in it. A young version of her mother, her dark hair pinned up, the yellow skirt of the dress swishing from side to side and her heels clacking as she walked &#8212; where? Toward Virginia, who was waiting for her. It’s not a real memory, not something she can pin down in time and place, but just an image &#8212; something she has conjured out of nothing, out of air and shadow and light.</p>
<p>Down the lane, she spots Cal. He’s just ahead, turning the corner onto Happy Hollow, and if she walks a little faster, she will catch him. She’ll catch him, and they’ll walk the rest of the way together. At some point, he’ll tell her his story, that he fucked a walking corpse. He’ll tell her he licked the air where her toes should’ve been, that he ran his hands over the holes in her arm, kissed the knobs of her fingerless knuckles. He’ll tell her he slept with a vanishing woman. A woman fading away, bit by bit, piece by piece. And unlike him, she will believe it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the night Will felt the floating sensation, he attended a performance of the Ugandan Boys Choir. The boys were trash scavengers, rescued by a Good Samaritan and taught to harmonize, who performed every night across California to raise donations and recruit volunteers for the Kampala orphanage. Will attended by himself, since Regina was at the baby shower for a college friend’s third child. This was the friend who’d called Regina, offhandedly and without malice, a ringless fiancée, by which she meant a woman certain to marry but lacking the diamond. Regina had grieved over the term for weeks.</p>
<p>The Ugandan Boys sang in the church for two hours. Terraced upon metallic risers, they elongated their jaws. On one song, the boys left the stage to pass donation baskets, and the volume and balance fluidly shifted as the voices swung close and away. The music seized Will. It offered odd time signatures, syncopated rhythms, contrapuntal notes. Despite his usual formality inside sacred walls, he found himself tapping his foot and nodding in tempo. Instead of his normal instinct to pin down feelings with philosophical thoughts, he wanted to run through fields and not grow weary. He wanted to swim and not grow tired. He wanted this soundtrack to animate his life.</p>
<p>Will closed his eyes. The melodies became flags, waving in tempo. The notes danced and died and regenerated. Then his chair seemed to exhale him, and the floor released his feet. The pressure on his buttocks eased. He hovered, feeling weightless as a bubble. His skin felt permeable, with no membrane between air and flesh. The sensation continued until the precise moment when—as if synchronized—the last note terminated. Then his body settled, tethered again. Applause erupted around him. He gripped the chair, breath drumming in his ears. He felt like he’d been attacked. He turned to the woman behind him and asked her if she saw it. “Yes, they’re great,” the woman said, nodding towards the choir, still clapping. Everyone stood in an ovation. No one paid him any attention. As the audience flooded the front to talk to the boys, he fled through the double doors, feeling pursued.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>He told Regina the following day, when they were on the couch with her dead aunt’s quilt. Though he preferred to rest in her room, Regina judged privacy a stumbling block to purity. He read. She knitted. Her long hair kept interfering with her needles. It’d grown past her waist, requiring the choke points of several bands. He often found Rapunzel-length strands in his car.</p>
<p>“Six months?” she said. “Uganda?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say I was going,” he said. “They just offered the opportunity.” He would miss her too much to go. Last summer, when he’d flown to a weeklong car convention in Denver, he called her twice a day. And there was no question of her accompanying him—their families would raise an outcry if they traveled together unmarried. They hadn’t even kissed. Influenced by the popular books in home-school circles, she’d made a promise—she didn’t swear, she refused to swear—not to kiss anyone but her husband. He respected her belief because he knew it would hurt her deeply to break that promise.</p>
<p>She’d stopped clicking her needles, a sound so metronomic he found himself adjusting his breath to match its pace. “Getting married is an adventure, too,” she said.</p>
<p>“And I want that,” he said. After all, he’d filled his quotient of adventure on two mission trips in his college years, to Indonesia and Samoa. She was living her adventure now, swarmed by toddlers at the day care. Once he’d surprised her at work with flowers, and discovered her bracing bottle-sucking girls off both hips, while using a knee to push a boy on the swing who screamed, “Higher! Higher!” She was beaming.</p>
<p>“You do this,” she said. “Remember dog breeding in Kentucky? Remember that Iranian underground-church plan?”</p>
<p>“You’re right,” he said. “It was silly to even bring it up.”</p>
<p>“It was,” she said.</p>
<p>When he first met Regina, at a brother- and sister-wing bowling night, she’d rolled a strike and curtsied. He’d stored that clip in his head, replaying it often. It was such a graceful act—the pinch of dress between index and thumb, the right foot bent behind, the chin dipped. She seemed a quaint maid transplanted from a bygone time. A month passed before he’d started courting her. She preferred that term to dating.</p>
<p>She used her thumb to rotate her purity ring. “Do you love me more than anything?”</p>
<p>“No,” he said.</p>
<p>Her head jerked. “Well, not more than God, of course,” she added hastily.</p>
<p>“Right,” he said. But he knew what she needed and gave it to her: he said that he loved her, that there was no one else, that she was beautiful.</p>
<p>She kneeled and lowered her head to the coffee table, so all he could see was the part in her blonde hair that exposed a vulnerable line of her scalp. He said her first name: once loudly, once quietly. He said her full name—Regina Sarah Olsen—but not even that unlocked her. Finally, she lifted her head. “If you really wanted to go, you could go,” she said. The words rang hollow.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t really considering it.”</p>
<p>“Well,” she said. “I just wouldn’t want to hold you back.” It sounded straight from a cue card. Still, the possibility resonated in his chest, as if all his organs were tuned to the pitch of her permission.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>She offered gifts. Usually she didn’t gift him except on birthdays and Christmas, but now she sprung them at random. At her apartment one night, he found her in an apron dusted with flour, both hands behind her back. She whipped out a gift-wrapped object, and he unwrapped it to find a book about the Icelandic chess match between Bobby Fisher and Boris Spassky during the Cold War. He hugged thanks. Afterwards, she fed him hot scones, tipping her fingers up at the end to help him eat each bite. He made Neanderthal chomping sounds and she squealed when he pretended to bite her fingers. When he said he didn’t want more, she insisted. She made engine noises and flew flight patterns until he relented.</p>
<p>One night, after working until nine, he found a pastel envelope fluttering under the gums of his windshield wipers. A card bearing her florid handwriting, the large cursive loops on the ‘l’s and ‘f’s, which, according to a manual on handwriting psychology he’d read, indicated a generous ego. In the card she flung a largesse of compliments, not the cheap trinkets that any stranger could trot out, but the genuine coin. It was one of her best traits, this way she had of loving him. He read it twice.</p>
<p>He drove to the bookstore with the intention of buying her a book. During a recent facelift, the store had shuffled their sections and he couldn’t find the cookbooks. Instead, he found himself on a long aisle with neon-colored spines. Just as he reached the end, a book cart wheeled up, blockading him. He backtracked, noticing the spines belonged to travel guides. He didn’t want to linger, but glanced over the titles. At eye level, out of alphabetical order, were three yellow Ugandan guidebooks. Why three? He would have guessed the store only carried the regional book. He leafed through, feeling guilty. Reading the introductory notes, he realized he knew nothing of Uganda—their language, their currency, their politics. All his knowledge came from the tired Western views of the continent, as if Africa were a homogenous blotch on the globe. He bought the guidebook, just to look at the pictures. Nothing more. Afterwards, he realized he’d forgotten to buy the cookbook, and when he met Regina and friends for board game night, he only said that he’d been browsing.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>Will and Regina attended a wedding in a spacious backyard. Regina and the bride had homeschooled together for years, and Regina relayed to him multiple times the story of the bride and groom meeting, betrothing and marrying within eight months. Paper lanterns swung from strings, apple cider filled the flutes, an aging Christian singer crooned from the stereo. Regina was not unhappy. Although there was no formal dancing, she swung the tuxedoed arms of her five-year-old brother. Will sat at the pink-creped table and watched the dignity of the bride and pent-up anticipation of the groom, the children chasing one another with party favors clutched in chubby hands. He knew these people. These were his people. They would keep attending church, keep elevating God, keep their marriage vows, keep raising their children in the ways they should go. Tragedies would be chalked up to the divine plan, and suffering embraced as a purifying force. Nothing truly unpredictable would happen: Butler would gain weight, Alison’s grandparents would tour the country in their motor home, the twins would win tennis tournaments. He could see five years, ten years, and knew that nothing would rupture their course. This, this. He wanted only this. With this he could be happy.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>“I have something to confess,” Will told her one sunny day, while they were at bat against a Valencia church. This wasn’t the place, he could feel how wrong it was. Sports warped the delicate bonds between males and females. A foul ball soared, outfielders bobbing heads to spot it and avoid their teammates. She didn’t wait for the pop fly resolution, just turned to him. She looked good in the loose jeans, dusted red from the last inning. Usually he only saw her in dresses. “I emailed the orphanage,” he said. The phrase resounded in the space between them. He felt like he’d hit her.</p>
<p>“That’s nice,” she said, turning away. Then she gripped the dugout railing and yelled at the new batter: “C’mon Lacey! Sock it!” He leaned back and waited for her to process and turn, angrily, but she didn’t. Normally, she let him make the hefty decisions, like whether to drive together to her Uncle’s house in San Francisco. She would act as though she didn’t care, although sometimes she did. Now, even though she couldn’t tell a shortstop from a catcher, she kept her focus on the game. The bark of the bat, the soar of the ball into the low sky, the outfielders scrambling to bottom it. She cheered and pumped a fist.</p>
<p>But in a way, he was relieved that she hadn’t pressed him. If she had, he would have admitted he didn’t want to email the orphanage. That he didn’t want to go at all. It was an email in a moment of thoughtlessness, about which he felt shameful, as if he’d gone to the wrong website and seen something he shouldn’t.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>In the shed at his parent’s house, his father soldered a scepter onto a queen. On the shelf, bishops apexed in a bulb and knights brandished swords from winged horses. The blade of the TIG torch seared his vision. His father swung off his hood and asked, “Ready to get whooped?”</p>
<p>They sat on either side of the upended wooden spool. This set was cast in geometric shapes: blocks for pawns, stacked balls for queens, triangles for bishops. His father got two glasses of lemonade, even though Will knew they’d forget to drink it, and secreted a black and white pawn in each fist. Will picked the right fist. White. Just before he moved, his father asked, “Now what’s this about Uganda?”</p>
<p>Up to that moment, Will had been deluded enough to believe that Regina hadn’t truly heard or didn’t care. But she must have deliberately dropped a comment, probably to his mother, which cascaded to his father. His parents wanted a quiver of grandchildren. The delay of several years seemed fruitless. And Regina knew they thought this way.</p>
<p>Will told him about the choir, trying to explain it offhandedly.</p>
<p>“Why would you want to go?” his father said.</p>
<p>“I don’t even know,” Will said. “I probably don’t want to.”</p>
<p>“I know why,” his father said. “You have a good heart and want to help people.”</p>
<p>It sounded like a solid reason, and Will let his father think it was the correct one. His father lived that way, helping people through the part-time work at the church and janitorial work for school, working despite the migraines. It was always about others. His father replied to the opening with the Budapest Gambit and slapped the clock vigorously. He’d played on the circuit with his junior college team but now spent most of his chess time building custom sets. Obscene requests were denied, but he’d built sets of New York/Los Angeles architecture and Roman emperors holding coins bearing their image.</p>
<p>“So did they get back to you?” his father asked.</p>
<p>“The orphanage? Yes. They gave details.” The details were draconian. Four volunteers slept in one small room. Food was austere. It was less of an enticement and more of a warning.</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t go,” his father said. “You’ve got too much to lose.”</p>
<p>His father traded a bishop for two of Will’s pawns and pushed his queenside. Will tried to blockade with a knight. Flies landed on the pieces and Will shooed them away. When Will was five, his mother found him sleeping in a laundry basket with a chessboard and pieces, and his father joked that he’d started playing in the womb. The day after his grandfather died, Will played a marathon session, and after he and Regina fought, he often retreated to an online site for blitz games.</p>
<p>His father advanced a pawn. “She can’t wait forever,” he said.</p>
<p>“I know,” Will said.</p>
<p>His father once built a religious chess set. Christ, Gabriel, disciples versus Satan, demons, possessed. When he told people about it, he asked them to guess which side was white. Then he’d laugh loudly. For some years he showcased the set on his website, but sold it because he didn’t like the possibility of black winning. Will liked the set concept—it implied that even the powers and principalities played by reason. And his father agreed, proposing that parishioners should play chess before church services, to usher them into God’s mode of thinking.</p>
<p>His father studied the board, elbows on the table. Will didn’t think he saw it. The next move Will would sacrifice a bishop. Once he sacrificed the bishop, the rest of the game would be inevitable. His father moved and Will replied. The move made his father inhale. There would be a smothered mate on h8 in seven moves. Every variation was accounted for, every sequence anticipated. The pure inevitability was beautiful. But when his father swung his hands out in frustration, he knocked over a glass of lemonade. It shattered on the concrete and Will felt a shiver against his pinky toe. Blood dewed from a cut. By the time they cleaned up the glass and sanitized the wound, his mother arrived home with groceries, and after they unpacked them, Will had to meet Regina. The game was lost. His father joked that he should injure opponents more often. “Like in chessboxing,” he said. He ducked his head and pretended to jab twice.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>Will was five years old, on his back. Bees hummed around his head. Oak branches sliced up the sky. Someone had yelled something he hadn’t understood. Black clouds formed and dissipated across his vision, and inside these clouds, blurred shapes of men and animals moved, as if seen through a dark glass. When the clouds stopped, the sky kaleidoscoped through the rainbow’s spectrum. He tasted colors. Burnt, smoky copper. Floral breezy gold. Then it all settled and the world righted itself. He started crying. Scruffy approached and licked his face. There was the bang of the screen door; there was the rapid flap of his mother’s sandals. She knelt and cupped his head and plied him with questions, and he could only remember playing with his truck, followed by the loud voice and the clouds and the colors. “What loud voice?” she asked. He said his head hurt. He wasn’t bleeding. He bore no marks.</p>
<p>One doctor diagnosed it as a strange type of stroke, and prescribed medication. Another doctor argued his body bore the signs of an electrical shock, a magnitude on par with lightening. His mother insisted there were no outlets or extension cords in the backyard and no clouds in the sky. Another doctor said nothing had happened, that his brain needed to discharge energy and he’d experienced powerful yet illusory sensations. They gave up going to doctors. Their degree of certainty directly correlated to their degree of inaccuracy. A few admitted their inability to pin down a reasonable answer, and told his mother to watch for a recurrence so more data could be gathered. But it hadn’t happened again, not like that, not for years.</p>
<p>In an early draft of his application for the philosophy program at The Lord’s College, Will told that story. It seemed a seminal moment, even though he’d never been able to assign it a precise role. Instinctively, he knew it explained why he wanted to study analytic philosophy, but couldn’t tell how. In a vague way he believed that philosophy could ward off events like that one, but since philosophers had to be able to clearly draw from point A to point B, he eventually cut it, substituting an essay on how he inherited the ideals of chess from his father.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>She kissed him. It was never meant to be that order of subject and object. He kissed her: that was how he’d always envisioned it. That order, he thought, was the only way that she would ever have wanted it. Allow the man to be the leader. After all, when they first started spending time together, she wouldn’t call him, insisting he should call her. But here she’d seized initiative.</p>
<p>They’d guided the junior high youth group to Magic Mountain and ridden the newest coaster. During the corkscrew at the end, his vision dimmed, as though someone twisted a knob for the lights. All the light funneled into the center then faded to black, and even the passengers’ screams decrescendoed. In that tunnel without exit he felt the terrifying sensation of losing control, and then the corkscrew straightened out to pull up to the platform and light and sound ebbed back.</p>
<p>They sat on a bench semi-blocked by bushes and she asked whether he was okay. He lied and said yes, forcing a smile. The smile triggered her.</p>
<p>He didn’t know how they’d dated for three years and never kissed. No, he knew. Her hirsute father who required an interview before granting permission to date his daughter. The group dates for the first six months, followed by chaperoned ones. Her mother telling the story of how the only person she’d ever kissed was Regina’s father. Regina’s reluctance to hold hands until a year had passed, and of course her promise to keep her lips virginal. Add to that his fear of himself, of losing control. Of believing passion in their marriage would be lost if he prematurely opened the gate of pleasure.</p>
<p>They spent a half hour on the bench, primly exploring each other’s lips. He’d expected to feel untamed. He’d always feared the urges of his loins. But the sensation gave him an odd detachment, a pleasurable distance from which he analyzed the situation. There were two people on a bench. They were kissing. It was a scene he’d watched thousands of times and even this time he remained more a viewer than a participant. She giggled. She fingered her long braid curled in her lap. He ignored the passersby, then glanced at them with embarrassment. A man carrying a cluster of balloons stopped across the way. As he detached a purple balloon for a girl, a red one wriggled loose and soared, weaving in its ascent.</p>
<p>Her line at the end disappointed him. He would have preferred a romantic mood, unleavened by laughter, but instead, as they moved to find the junior highers, she teased him: “Wouldn’t you miss that?” Motives curdled the moment. Instead of the supernova of a long-awaited pleasure, it seemed calculated. He suspected why she said it: earlier in the day, a mob of black children passed by, corralled by two black ladies who alternated between gaiety and reprimands, and he turned to look at the children, feeling nostalgic about an experience he had not yet had. She saw him look and he saw her interpret.</p>
<p>He meant to only peck her when he dropped her off at her apartment, but couldn’t resist lingering. On the drive home, he admitted that despite his aversion to her method, it certainly worked: he would miss that, if he were crazy enough to leave. He would miss it terribly.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>At that backyard wedding they’d attended, Will had heard Regina’s Uncle Roy tell a story about a distant British relative of the Olsen clan. The man had left his wife one day, just walked out the front door and did not come back. Apparently, he moved just a few blocks over and changed his job. He spied on her but never contacted her. There was no mistress. It was a loving marriage. Eventually his wife counted him among the dead. They held a funeral. He spied on the funeral. Once he walked past his wife on the street and his wife did not recognize him. A few months after the funeral, he returned to his own house during the night and settled into bed. In the early morning hours, his wife woke and found a strange man occupying her bed. Nothing about him made her think he might have been her former husband. So she seized a letter opener and stabbed him. When he cried out, she recognized his voice. She called an ambulance and paramedics saved him.</p>
<p>That was where the story ended. The circle broke up to attend to misbehaving children. But Will asked Uncle Roy what happened. Uncle Roy said the couple had gone to therapy, not that it helped. The man was impenetrable. He didn’t fight the therapist, he just had nothing inside him that the therapist found helpful. The man didn’t know why he had left or why he had come back. He seemed as confused about it as everyone else, except that he knew he’d needed to leave. His wife had gone to see the brownstone where her husband had lived, but someone else had already rented it. Apparently, he’d thrown everything in a dumpster. A clean break. He wanted to pick up life where they’d left off. The story happened twenty years ago, and from that time he’d been a devoted husband.</p>
<p>The next day Will told Regina he hated the story. It made him feel sick.</p>
<p>“Oh, that story’s not true,” Regina said. “Uncle Roy embellishes all the time.”</p>
<p>Will countered that her father and aunts had not questioned the story, but Regina insisted it was made-up. Her head wagged no, as if swinging along a deep groove. Suddenly he knew that whatever its truthfulness, she couldn’t accept it. He realized: even if she were the wife of that man, she wouldn’t believe the story.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>That night insomnia haunted him, despite his usual trick of squeezing the pressure point between thumb and index. He rose and sat at the dining table. His roommate’s snores bored through the door. The cabinets and furniture took on new contours, reshaped by generous shadows and stingy light. He started a list. Lists organized the world, offering neat parameters and channels. On one side, Negative: Career, parents, money, physical love, and above all, Regina. His pen lingered over the Positive side without committing to the page. Finally, in a bid to put a word down, he wrote, “Called?” Then he jammed the list in the trash beneath the chicken carcass and returned to his bed where he lay, sleepless, watching moonlight drift across the floor from the fulcrum of the blinds. He worried about experiencing one of his moments, but felt nothing.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>He and Regina walked near his apartment, following a meandering path through the tree-canopied canyon. It was on the outskirts of the city, full of low ranch houses splayed out on multiple-acre plots. The imprints of horse hooves were fossilized in the ground. Even though it was January, an autumnal palette of leaves clung to the trees.</p>
<p>They talked of teaching a Sunday school lesson about Abraham and Isaac and of visiting Santa Barbara with her parents and seven siblings. They talked of the new program that automatically censored foul language from movies. He had the feeling she was avoiding any mention of Uganda, so he hinted at the topic by saying that his boss promised a chance at promotion if he didn’t hightail it to a foreign country.</p>
<p>She shrank into herself, as though storing up energy before a launch. “I think I know why you feel compelled to go,” she said. She threw her shoulders back the way she did before every spiel. Then she launched into his record of service in college: missionary, soup-server, poverty minister, worship leader, camp counselor. A poster child of self-sacrifice. “And what do you do now?” she said. “Now you rent cars. Now you make money. Now you focus only on yourself and me. It’s no wonder that you feel like you need to give a little again.” She seemed satisfied by this explanation, as if hoping the sense of it would overcome his urges.</p>
<p>The logic was inescapable. She’d put words to something he’d once imagined: himself in that Greek myth where the protagonist stares at his reflection until he dies. Except in his case, there wasn’t one reflection but hundreds. Hundreds of mirrors surrounding him, all showing himself to himself, and it was horrifying. But that vision came only in a moments of doubt. He had created ways to give of himself, to her and to his community, even though not at the same rate. Of course he wanted to give more, but that wouldn’t justify a continental leap. “That’s not bad,” he admitted. “But I think it’s beyond that.”</p>
<p>“Beyond it to what?”</p>
<p>Will thought of a man playing a flute through the streets, and those that streamed out to follow him. He thought of images flashed so quickly that the naked eye couldn’t detect them. He thought of the trigger words used by hypnotists to set their subjects in motion. “To listening?” he said.</p>
<p>They walked on. He noted every item in their path, as if later he could revisit the order and quilt a patchwork of meaning. Hull of a snail, a fake mustache, an atlas page. He didn’t know how the conversation turned dark. Her tears arrived without warning. She began complaining that he was keeping her emotionally hostage. “Make a decision,” she said. “Tell me you won’t leave me.”</p>
<p>“Every day I make the decision to stay,” he said.</p>
<p>“That means any day you could go.”</p>
<p>He pictured himself walking out of her apartment and never going back. The idea scared him more than any nightmare. He doubted he had that willpower. He didn’t want that willpower. Her eyes scanned his face, reading the lines of his cheeks, his mouth, the ridge between eyebrows. She must have disliked what she saw.</p>
<p>“I didn’t want to show you this but I will,” she said.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>They drove back to her apartment and she set up the laptop. A video clip with yesterday’s date. The BBC’s accents dignified even the most tragic events. It showed men in tattered jerseys waving rifles from the back of trucks. The ticker tape read “January Massacre.” The voiceover related the political troubles in Kenya, and the map flashed the long border with Uganda. Key phrases surfaced: fleeing refugees, destabilized government, dominoeing violence. The images veered from skinny men in oversized T-shirts shooting weapons to clusters of men pumping fists in the air. The segment ended on a shot of a muddy pond, with lumpy bags stacked on the shore. Then he realized. Those were not bags. Those were not bags.</p>
<p>“You hadn’t heard,” she said.</p>
<p>He imagined bullets strafing over his head or militants holding him ransom. During college, his friend’s mission trip to India had been cancelled because of a nuclear standoff between India and Pakistan, and everyone understood: you couldn’t visit the volatile regions.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” she said. Her eyes looked daubed with blush. “I’d hoped not to show you.”</p>
<p>“No, thanks. I—”</p>
<p>“Right,” she said. “You shouldn’t.”</p>
<p>“Of course not. I can’t.”</p>
<p>She replayed the video without sound. The jump cuts flashed rhythmically. The colors seemed brighter, the action quicker. Men’s mouths formed O’s of silent exaltation. Will turned away at the end, but Regina didn’t. She stared as the screen’s glow brightened over her face, her own mouth slowly expanding into an oval. Then she closed the laptop screen and the room fell dark.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>He drove back to his apartment so slowly two cars honked at him. There did not seem to be a road; he drove mechanically, by memory. The lights of opposing vehicles refracted as if through prisms. When he stared at them without focusing, the gyre of light widened until it diffused and his sight refocused on the narrow beams. There must have been a parking space; there must have been a walk to the door.</p>
<p>Inside his apartment, he stood at his bedroom window. He lived with his roommate on the third floor, overlooking the park at the base of the loamy hills where he’d once picnicked with Regina. A memorial service consecrated the park—the bobbing candles looked like a revolving galaxy. He blocked out the view and leaned his head against the window. It cooled a strip on his forehead. All the distant sounds of a neighbor revving a car and his roommate’s television drained away. Each breath expanded and deflated his entire frame, the air reaching even his thighs, his head, until even his breath vanished, and he felt motionless, suspended in a vat of fluid. His head grew light, as though the blood flushed from his brain and coalesced in his chest. Then he sensed, behind eyelids, the entire room swell, objects blooming so close that he felt shrunk by their magnitude, and the shifting sizes disoriented him. His ears hurt; his equilibrium swam. It tilted him, made him drift. This time, he didn’t fight it. He let the objects press against him, overwhelm him. He sensed his own body enlarging to match their dilated size and was not afraid.</p>
<p>When he finally opened his eyes, he felt it. A breaker had flipped, and all of the uncertainty had settled and flattened. This he realized: all the reasons were stacked against his going, and he would still do it. He was meant to fling himself into a future he could not read. He went down to the computer, placed in the public space of the living room to encourage moral internet habits. From the kitchen came the sounds of his roommate, the shuffle of socks and clack of dishware. Although Will knew precisely what airline, what time, what website, he still ran one last check, to confirm someone hadn’t scaled the price down. He had a distressing vision that the airline had swooned out of business or that rising oil had spiked the ticket price, but nothing had changed.</p>
<p>When he pressed the button to buy the plane ticket, he remembered a cliff in Mexico, at the lip of the frothy sea. After his short-term team had finished building houses, they’d gone to the Caribbean coast and taken turns jumping from this cliff. It wasn’t too high, only about twenty feet, but when he was on top, it looked more like forty. The waves came in, the waves left. A sliding hue of dark blue, light blue, and grainy beige. If he didn’t time the leap right, he’d hit rock. He measured the rhythms and coaxed his heartbeat into preparing his legs. Then the moment of ditching the ground, of sailing out and over. His throat tightening up. Arms flailing. Legs flexed from the force of the jump. The bubbling up of vertigo, the uplift of a freefall armed with only timing and hope. It was a feeling he’d missed.</p>
<p>Back in his bedroom, gripping a printout of the confirmation number, he eyed his backpack and closet, knowing it was too soon to pack but already cataloguing the list of supplies. A chamois instead of a towel. Pure DEET instead of the diluted version because it took less space. Pants that zipped off to make shorts. He tasted tears before he realized he was crying. He wiped them from his smiling lips and left them on his cheeks. Though he hoped she would forgive him, he felt that she would not. In the center of the room, surrounded by the debris that would soon be separated into staying and going, he held out his hands, palms up, clenching and releasing, clenching and releasing. It felt good. He kept repeating the motion, imagining spheres rising from his opening palms to drift along the ceiling, each departing one reducing his weight until he felt he might float. Then he thought he heard, perhaps from the kitchen or from even farther, someone say his name.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[Selected by <em>Wiglaff</em> magazine as one of the best 50 short short stories published in 2011.]</strong></p>
<p>Where do they find these animals? The halt and the lame, the half-blind, the<br /> parboiled, the skeptical showered in the alkaloid mud of a corral hammered slant behind<br /> T. Murphy’s Snowmobile Shop. A fat pair of jacks, Arnold and Rooster, appear to be<br /> twins. One has a roached mane. The other dandles fetlocks as curly as Buffalo Bill<br /> Cody’s bleached mustache. Little Tom Petsch, the farrier, claims they can carry a load.<br /> “Dead broke,” he says. “Climb a hill like a cat.” Little Tom owes back taxes to the<br /> county, has a fetish for German handguns. He doesn’t believe he knows me. I suss<br /> out the truss-hipped jenny that is said to come from Arizona where working the Grand<br /> Canyon separates the wheat from the dog food. She’s as narrow as a mill race, the color<br /> of wet Absaroka Mountain scree. She looks hungry for something. Her pumpjack head<br /> primes the bony lever of her neck. I see how the tendons in her forelegs have been pin-<br /> fired, a piss-poor job of it too. Futile. She’ll never tread the straight path again. The<br /> wind looses its wet lash across the spine of Carter Mountain. The jenny works her lips<br /> around stalks of cold, icy air. Her belly is salted with the eggs of absconded flies. I read<br /> the spackle of her scattered scars as indebted starlight, as ash.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Juan Julio could describe the misfortune with a soft clarity, so that the impression he left upon the listener was that of a tune hummed from a porch step, during the long liquid hours of the first, floating dark.</p>
<p>That it was a brutal and tragic tale did not diminish the gentleness of its comprehension, such was Juan Julio’s skill. Neither did the fact that it was a steaming, hundred degree day, heavy as the rain clouds that ballooned about the sky above the pasture. As his men labored at a distance, sawing and trimming out tree foliage that threatened the power lines, he told the story again, and the old man at his side – a doctor to whose farm the crew had been sent – stood privy to the pressure of Juan Julio’s romance.</p>
<p>“They sent us after the hurricane, down to a place too far from the city for the cameras to come, too far from the sea for people to know of. Old people lived there – the old, poor ones – the kind who cannot be driven from their homes – even by the promise of more to eat and less to do and a cooler place to do it in. The old poor ones who will not surrender what they have always seen, even if it is the worst of things. They live very close to the world they know, these people, and must be let alone there –  even by those who come to offer more. No good can come of that, even if good is meant.”</p>
<p>The drone of the saws lamenting against the green wood drew closer, made it harder for Dr. Priest to hear. So the old man stepped within a few feet of the Mexican, and positioned himself so that his best ear was nearest the tale.</p>
<p>Dr. Priest had lived his whole life in this town, the last half of it on this farm, and had never met a Mexican. But these five were all from there, as was every other man who came to the place now – to haul horses, to fix water mains, to read the meter. They worked from a white service truck, with a cherry-picker to lift one man up to the level of the interlaced elms, hackberries and sumacs that crowded the phone lines. As this man toiled from the bucket with his saw, two others labored on the ground to clear the falling debris and feed it into a wood chipper. Down on the road that faced the doctor’s land, a fifth man drove a tractor with a boom cutter. A platform of blades whirled at the end of an arm reaching from the machine to the bordering trees. Even at a distance, the savage munch and chop of the low-lying limbs made Dr. Priest wince – made his small, rheumy eyes tear.</p>
<p>“So they sent us after the hurricane,” Juan Julio continued, “streaming down the branch-filled roads in our trucks, caught in the trail of the storm’s pull – to this land that was more cage than world, trapped within its own being – as though the whole place had sat upon a cloth, and that cloth upon a table. And then, at some moment, the four corners had been taken up, to let all that lay upon the surface plunge in upon itself – this way and that – over and under and against – until it made no sense anymore. They sent us there with orders to make the world straight – to make even that for which we had no north or south, and of which we knew no history – none with which to make what was into what had been.”</p>
<p>Juan Julio wiped his forehead with the meat of his forearm, so that the flesh glistened in the early afternoon light.</p>
<p>He was as tall as Dr. Priest had been, before age had stooped him. But besides his status and his formal air, there was a marked difference between the foreman and the others. They were little and mustachioed, and they veiled their black eyes beneath dusty, close-fitting caps. But Juan Julio was clean-shaven and hatless, his hair cut short in a military style. He wore crisp khakis and a fresh polo shirt. Only his boots showed the scuff that might be expected.  His eyes were bright and direct, and though he had an accent, his English was smooth, schooled; Dr. Priest could not understand the others.</p>
<p>“What you see now” – Juan Julio pointed to the workers – “we did then, there, in that place. Except the earth was no longer set out in the squares that mark men’s claims.”</p>
<p>The chain saw broke through the circumference of a limb, so that a mighty crack sounded as the blade caught its breath. The two men on the ground struggled to untangle the fallen bough from the lower foliage. Then a gloss of new sunlight broke onto the pasture, free to bathe the weeds and fescue.</p>
<p>“It would have been all right,” Juan Julio said, “had we been the same kind of people.  In a strange place, there must be something you can count on. The men beside you must know the things you do.”</p>
<p>“These you see here,” he said, and pointed to the workers, “these with me – they all come from my village in Nuevo León. They have done this work a long time, and each knows his role.  With a duty such as ours, with a task such as that, to make the world even and plain, there is no room for questions. The problem is what to do, not how to do it – where to start, not how one starts to begin with.”</p>
<p>Juan Julio frowned, considered what he had said. Then he remade his point.</p>
<p>“My grandfather told me. In a battle, the questions are small: from which direction to fight – head-on, or from the flank? – but not questions about how to hold a sword. The men must already know such things; they must be soldiers by that time, not still farmers.”</p>
<p>He stopped, wiped his brow again. Dr. Priest stepped closer.</p>
<p>“But we were not the same men.”</p>
<p>Because those they sent were of all types, all skills, and many were not fit for the task. They were men for different times, for a known world – men who worked with hand tools, who sawed lumber from a mill, who masoned brick fresh from a mold, or managed water that ran within pipes. The work they did only made sense when the place itself did, when houses lined streets, and trees rose from mown grass. They were not men for a place with no line between outside or in – when water lapped at windows and trees lay down like the slain. Even the men from Juan Julio’s crew were unsure of their way, though clearing the land was their native task.</p>
<p>“Even we had to scrape the earth,” said Juan Julio, “to find traces of a drive, a road, a curb – some paved corner that would tell us where to lay the teeth of the saw.”</p>
<p>It was as though they were chipping away at an ice wall, to uncover the bones of a primitive beast, or sweeping the floor of a pit, to reveal the stones of an ancient culture – trying to retrieve a thing or a place that the earth had swallowed up with its slow brown mouth.  In such times, when even the master is unsure of his craft, it is madness to employ the novice – and criminal to arm him with means.</p>
<p>“But that is what happened,” said Juan Julio.</p>
<p>In fact, they all suspected the days themselves lay under a spell, as if the confusion of the landscape had broken in upon the fabric of a recollected life, breached the judgment of those who – at any other moment in the regular course of existence – would know better than to mix such unlike things, or to permit so careless an enterprise. Their wits, dazzled by what they saw, made fools of the lot, so that if a mere child had presented himself at the dawn of a day’s labor, he would not only have gone unchallenged, but would have been fitted straight away with a blade broader than his waist, and manned with a canister of gas, a box of matches.</p>
<p>“We were dizzy with fatigue, and our thirst could not be slaked, though we drank constantly. The work we did was poor, careless – even that of the skilled. The best of us gave place to the least, and even a good job started would likely end in frustration – broken tools, lack of oil, lost directions.”</p>
<p>Juan Julio swallowed.</p>
<p>“But mostly we were frightened, milling about in the footprints of a monster, clearing the ruin of her wrath. And no matter what they told us – who could say that she would not turn back, retrace her steps,  come for those who erased the marks she’d meant to leave? We slept in fits, fought often. Hate came easily.”</p>
<p>More than once Juan Julio had studied a man’s neck, then gauged the size and strength of his own hands.</p>
<p>“I am ashamed of this now,” he said, looking away. “But it is true, and I tell it to atone for what I desired.”</p>
<p>Dr. Priest closed his eyes, nodded. He had been in war. He had known the same thing that the Mexican spoke of and had done worse than just ponder it. Not only had he done worse, what’s more, he had lived to know of other things, worse yet.</p>
<p>“It was a hazy day,” said Juan Julio, his voice rising to the pitch of the saws.</p>
<p>“None of us mentioned the pale fog that hung in the air, but we noticed and worried why it should be. Was it fire, eating its way toward us, silently – a blaze that would all at once send flames from the tangled brush, at a point too late to run?”</p>
<p>But they could not smell smoke. So was it rain? The mist of some early child of a storm, thrust from the giant’s hollow, now growing into a menace of its own – to undo what little good they had realized?</p>
<p>“But the clouds were high that day, and the wind was docile. So how could it be rain?”</p>
<p>Still, there it hung, as though they had stepped within a curse for which they were ignorant of both the deserving and the unfolding. All day they rubbed their eyes, waved their hands before their faces – but none spoke of what he saw.</p>
<p>Perhaps that was why they misunderstood. They had thought that the meaning of the day would be related to the purpose of the haze; that what fogged their sight would prove their undoing; if not of all, then of some; if not of some, then of only one. Perhaps it was this error that had caused what happened, because they were so intent upon the source – fire, water, evil – that their attentions were divided; the mélange of half-skills and muddled wits, the lack of a voice to speak to, or to bring order from, the chaos that surrounded them. Engrossed, absorbed, they had looked for the mist to mean something, and had been caught unawares, facing the wrong way.</p>
<p>Juan Julio turned to the road, pointed to the tractor that inched slowly along the border. The arm at its side held out the flat mouth of blades, like a head at the end of a neck – like the unhinged jaws of a reptile – to the trapped and waiting trunks. Dr. Priest’s gaze followed the man’s finger; the tops of the trees quaked as the violence tore at them from beneath.</p>
<p>“I had been working with the tractor, guiding the boom so that it lay against a snarl of trees and undergrowth. The arm would catch at times, buck and bounce, when placed against a mass too thick for it to eat. Two men trailed behind me, pulling away the cuttings and piling them into heaps. I could not see them, but I knew that they were there.”</p>
<p>The work was slow, the man explained; twenty feet an hour, along a roadside they had discovered only the day before.</p>
<p>“The people to whom the road led had been trapped, cut off from provisions, and it was feared they would stay there, starve and rot, rather than leave their homes unattended. So we worked on, all day. There was no rest. Without a word to each other, we began to take odd turns at the labor – shifts unequal in both length and difficulty.”</p>
<p>From time to time, some man or woman, filthy and wide-eyed, would step out from the wooded maze with a can of some sort – for gas or water – and tell of the need that lay behind them, in the direction in which they were headed.</p>
<p>“I am not sure if that was on that day, but it seems as though I worked so long that the shudder and rattle of the machine leached through my skin and into my bones, so that it shot through and burned them – as though I had held fast to an electric wire, as though the wire held me as I held it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped, smiled. His eyes broke free of their frozen width.</p>
<p>“That is what they say it is like, Doctor. Is it not?”</p>
<p>The old man nodded; so he had heard; like your skin, meat, vessels, your very heart, were being sifted through a wire screen, pulped and pulsed through a grill. Once, as an intern, he alone had been made to sit with a room full of electrocuted men. The metal scaffold upon which they were working had been pushed into a transformer. There was nothing that could be done but watch them convulse, writhing as the mortal shock tossed them about from within, like an animal trying to free itself from a cocoon.</p>
<p>“At some point, I stopped, climbed down; I do not remember whether I meant for someone to relieve me. I do not recall asking for such a thing. But I remember stepping aside as someone brushed past, climbed into the cab, started the motor, then the cutter.”</p>
<p>He continued to point towards the road; Dr. Priest watched on – as the tractor crawled, as the cutter gnawed.</p>
<p>“Why did I do that?” he asked the old man. “Step away? I cannot answer. I remember walking off, my back to the business behind, as if my home lay on the other side of the trees, and my wife had called me to supper. I remember that I stopped, surprised to see my feet, and wondered how I had come to be there. I put my hand to my head.”</p>
<p>He did so again, brushing his brow as if the doctor had asked to him to repeat the gesture, so as to unfold the symptoms of some malady.</p>
<p>“They tell me I had worked for eight hours, straight. They tell me I had taken no water. Those things I cannot remember, though I recall the size of my tongue. What is true, it is impossible to say now. Because though I did not see it, as I stood there, the new man in the cab lurched the machine forward, so that it bucked on its axle, one wheel catching – spinning in the mud.”</p>
<p>The Mexican turned sideways, threw out his hip to mimic the thing’s massive pitch.</p>
<p>“The boom snapped the pins that held it fast, so that it swung free, turned back on the two men behind. One leapt clear; but not the other.”</p>
<p>Juan Julio said that the thing had destroyed the man in a scale of ways, as though it could not decide on the right manner in which to kill him. His arm, shorn from the shoulder cap, was slung into the cleared space, where it laid there, stretched out properly, formally – while the flesh of his back and side were chewed, as though by a pack of savage dogs. Then there were two great slashes, one from the man’s ear to his chest, stopping at a point half way; the other from his collar to his hip, almost clean through, so that he lay on the ground in a curve, like a spring coiled at an angle upon the grass.</p>
<p>“It was a neat death,” the Mexican explained, the cuts so great that the blood came in gouts rather than showers. He died with his remaining arm curled beneath him, his face held in his hand, and that hand upon the earth.</p>
<p>“As if he were ashamed of the way he had ended. As if his wounds were his sins, and he must hide his eyes from judgment.”</p>
<p>When Juan Julio was finished, he stepped back from the old man. The tale itself might have laid upon the ground, marked with stones – a small cairn of sorrow.</p>
<p>Dr. Priest observed the silence, or such of it as there was.</p>
<p>The men were still laboring in the trees. But even after a few moments had passed, and the workers were further down the way, he could not bring himself to ask the Mexican more. Juan Julio had finished, and to call him back to the story would be an offense. Dr. Priest had always respected the delicacy of endings.</p>
<p>Still, as the sun lumbered through the sky, and as the old man made his way back through the shadowless pasture to the house – the crew having finished for the day – he wondered about the one who had died.</p>
<p>What had they done with his body, way out there in the heat, so far down in the bayou? Even here, hours north of the Coast, they had lost power for a week and had been stranded for days on end. Isolated, what had they done with the remains?</p>
<p>He opened the door to the house, stood in the kitchen and let the frigid air dry his sweat into a carapace. But he did not feel like ending the day just yet. With a glass of iced tea, he went back outside and sat on the gallery swing.</p>
<p>It was the time of summer when the light barely surrendered the sky; hours from now, he knew, there would still be hours yet before dark. Night was a scarce thing now, but he scarcely missed it.</p>
<p>In the past, he would never have believed that possible. Once, it was all he had longed for: a cloaked, unbroken chain of rest, with no calls to rouse and summons. It had been such a rare thing. Now, his wife had to badger him from his chair in the late evenings, force him to sleep in the bed. He rose well before dawn; he kept the house lit.</p>
<p>From his vantage in the swing, he could view one of his favorite sights – his small herd of Angus making its way back from a pond in the far pasture. Once raised for profit, now they were a hobby – in truth, even less; now they were part of a vignette, something to adorn the property, to make it quaint, precious. The noise for the past few days had disturbed their routine, driving them across the field to escape it. But with the men gone, the cattle seemed to have settled down again. The line moved lazily back to the upper grasses, to resume their constant, singular task.</p>
<p>He set the swing into a gentle rock, pushing off with his toe.</p>
<p>At some point in the coming days, Dr. Priest would find a time to ask Juan Julio his questions. What was the man like? For example; the one who had died. Did Juan Julio know him? Was he even a man? For the Mexican called all of his workers “men,” when two of them were clearly no more than boys. And most importantly, what had become of the driver? Was he punished? Sued? Did he go mad with grief and guilt?</p>
<p>The sun was reaching the point in the afternoon when it fell level with the roof line, and hence shot a cannon of light beneath the gallery eaves. For the time being, it only blazed across his feet and shins. But soon the glare would drive him from his place.</p>
<p>He lifted the glass and ran it along his forehead, then down the sides of his cheeks. He had begun to sweat again, despite the ceiling fans that hung down from the gallery roof.</p>
<p>There would be a moment he could ask such things, about the man, about Juan Julio; there was still much work to do. The pasture was long, and the other side of the property was ribboned with another set of lines that had to be cut back as well.</p>
<p>Juan Julio and his crew would return.</p>
<p>They had taken a liking to each other from the first, he and the Mexican; at least Dr. Priest had fancied as much. He would admit this was partly due to the fact that he enjoyed any new thing that presented itself in a day. It had been such a long time since he’d had a reason for his rising.</p>
<p>But on the first morning, they had come unexpectedly. His wife had sent him to see who was at the door. Juan Julio stood outside the foyer, formally, as though he’d come for a visit. He’d explained that the county had hired and sent them; that it was time to care for the lines. Five years had passed, by the municipal schedule, since the trees had been cut back. They had to be shorn.</p>
<p>Dr. Priest, then and there, had said that his wife did not care for such things. She valued her trees, no matter how far across the farm that they travelled, no matter whose power was threatened by their height. He’d related how others had butchered the foliage before, turning branches into stubs and knobs, leaving the whole avenue ragged and unsightly. The Mexican listened, respected such a thing, even agreed with it. Then he invited Dr. Priest to watch them, to object if their work was severe.</p>
<p>Dr. Priest had been amazed at such an offer, somehow even honored by it.</p>
<p>The schedule of the men’s task saved him from the confusion his days had become since his practice was closed; a confusion that was worse now, not better, as all had said it would be. Worse with every year, in fact, and it had been many since he quit. It seemed that a door was always closing these days – things of any purpose being wrapped up and handed along. He could not content himself with avocations – sports, books, horses, even his cattle – and pretend that they were a life. This annoyed him greatly. He would not admit it, but he longed for things to break – pipes to freeze in the winter, roof tin to blow from the barn – so that he could call for repairmen to come and then follow the workers as they plied their crafts. So when Juan Julio arrived with his crew, unbidden, it was a great and welcome surprise.</p>
<p>Every morning, the old man showered, had his coffee, dressed for the heat of the coming day. To discourage mosquitoes, he pulled his athletic socks to his knees, where they met the hem of his baggy shorts, so that he looked like a small, knickered boy. He wore T-shirts given to him by grandchildren, ones that needed shrinking to fit – team logos emblazoned on the front – a baseball cap and dark glasses. Then he went out to meet them, down to the end of the road, with keys to open the gate. There was a mist in the air – thick as bees – as though the sun had walked the earth before his rising, left traces of itself in the light, like pollen floating in dew.</p>
<p>What he had said that afternoon, Juan Julio – of the storm, of the man split in two – was only the latest tale he’d related. Over the days that had passed, the Mexican spoke of other catastrophes: a dustbowl at the border, with desperate men hanging beneath the truck on the axles so as to cross; a gang of bandits, skulking like trolls beneath a bridge, to take a cut of their earnings when they passed. But more often, Juan Julio spoke of his endeavors, his skill at commerce. The poles about the fence rows were draped with three lines, and as the men cleared them with patience and care, Dr. Priest heard of the younger man’s endeavors.</p>
<p>“I bought my first truck with five year’s earnings,” Juan Julio had said. “My second, I bought with the earnings of three. I brought up more men from my village, along with my brother, who watches the second crew, just as I do these.”</p>
<p>It turned out that he nearly had money for a third, what with the extra funds the government had paid him for working after the storm. He spoke of all these things with a charming pride.</p>
<p>Whenever they broke for lunch, the men sat at the fence line, wrapped in the shade they were soon to destroy, and opened their iceboxes. Dr. Priest would leave them, return to the house for a time. There, as he picked at the meal his wife had cooked too much of, he would explain the progress being made. But whenever he heard the still heat broken by the saw’s wail, he would reseat his cap upon his plastered hair and set out for the pasture again. Sometimes he brought them lemonade or iced tea; sometimes he brought them the rest of a cake his wife had made.</p>
<p>“If my men get drunk,” Juan Julio had told him, “they stay home. They make their choice. They don’t eat if they don’t work. If they chose to drink instead of eat – all right – they do as they wish. But they don’t work, beg though they may. They are responsible for themselves. They owe me nothing, but then I pay them nothing.”</p>
<p>The men were careful around Juan Julio, and he watched them like a schoolmaster. He said he collected them for mass on Sundays, and took them to the hospital if they absolutely had to go. But he himself kept a case full of medicines and antiseptics for their minor illnesses. This he had Dr. Priest review, to see if his store was adequate for the purpose.</p>
<p>It seemed that Juan Julio would speak to his men only when it was time to move the truck, or when it was time to take a break. Dr. Priest had even asked the Mexican why they needed such a scarcity of instruction.</p>
<p>It was because he had trained them so well. And he knew so well how to train them because this was how he had started.</p>
<p>“For years I cut, I cleared, I drove the machine. But with a difference,” he had said, between him and the others. “I saw more than my hands.”</p>
<p>The cattle were all back in the field now, bloated with water, heads declined for the grass. He heard his wife stirring in the house, a business that never ended; he was envious, and sometimes aggravated, that her life had never transformed, never changed. He got in her way, now that he had no way of his own, but her path was the same as it had ever been.</p>
<p>He leaned out from his seat to see the browned foliage of a dead evergreen at the corner of the house. That afternoon, before the men had left, he had asked Juan Julio to cut it down. It had been a Christmas tree thirty years ago. And there was a picture of it in a drawer or book somewhere, decorated with lights and balls, and a message along the white border: “tree at corner of house.” A live spruce of some sort, it was a better choice for Christmas than it was for the yard, as it had grown twice as tall as the roof, and its jealous breadth crowded the way around. But a drought the summer before had killed it; heaps of brown needles littered the ground, and desiccated branches were prey to the wind. Dr. Priest offered Juan Julio fifty dollars on the side if he would remove it.</p>
<p>He leaned back in the swing, drank the last of his tea.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, the Mexican would take the tree down, for two twenties and a ten—a week’s wages, when Dr. Priest was in his training. But a man like Juan Julio could make a great deal from so little. A man like that knew how to get along.</p>
<p>He rattled the ice against the glass.</p>
<p>It used to be that way for Priest himself. He cleared; he cut; he cleaned.</p>
<p>But now, when stillness is all that is asked of him, he recollects nothing but motion, as though in all the years before he had been hooked to a line, one that had rushed him through a torrent of borderless, numberless days. Back then, he had been all hands, all eyes, all feet. Now, he moved through their recollections like a man through a museum. They limn out from shadow, and his fingers itch at their sight.</p>
<p>There was the child he had seen on a table, as though sleeping, except that the flesh of his trunk was peeled back, his organs, shy and small, still as a stopped clock. And a rodeo rider, calm as pond water, sitting on a gurney, though a bull had hooked a horn into his mouth, then out through the orbit of his eye. There was his son, a young boy, curled and sleeping in the wheel wells as Priest drove through the night to make calls – in the days when you went to houses; in the days when they came to yours. With his wife sleeping next to him, he had handed syringes through the window to a man needing tetanus shots; he had stepped on a nail in a junkyard, and had knocked on the window to rouse him. There were people full of water, so bloated he’d been forced to use a bucket to bail it all clear; there were children fed through a feed mill augur; a girl, ravaged by a hog; a man’s face, split open by an oak plank shot backwards from a saw mill wood planer – his frantic eyes staring out on either side of a cracked skull, demolished nose, cleft palate – Priest had run a wire through his cheeks to stabilize his face. Stab wounds on Saturday nights, lungs near to collapse, tubes pushed through to inflate them. The poor had born gifts – turnips, collards, pole beans; they had known his father, they had known his grandfather; he took the sacks and gave them to the orderlies, then marked the bills paid. And phone calls he would make – after tests had been run – good news to bring – that it was nothing; that it was all right; that there was time after all, years and years of a life left.</p>
<p>He stared at his tea glass, trying to remember why he had become confused.</p>
<p>Soon it will be time for supper, a thought that made him sigh. He will tell his wife he is not hungry, then they will argue over this fact, as they do every night. In the end, he will have a bowl of cereal before he goes to bed. His appetite is that of a child.</p>
<p>When he is done with his meal, he will walk down to close the gate, then return to sit here, to watch for the lightening bugs. She will read by the television, talk on the phone, plans visits from their children, grandchildren. Holidays seem increasingly desperate now – too many people eager to be too nice, to stare too long. They watch him closely, gauge how much he eats, try too hard to amuse him, and wonder at his rest – is it enough, is it too much? He knows what they think; he has thought such things himself, from bedsides.</p>
<p>The line of the sun was nearly level with his face. He took a detached interest in its progress, as its heat climbed up his legs, his hips, his chest, like anesthesia as the table is tipped.</p>
<p>“You won’t remember this,” he would say to the man who lay there. “I’ll call your name when it’s over.”</p>
<p>He shuts his eyes.</p>
<p>The story of the hurricane had troubled Juan Julio. Priest sees that now. The man had wanted to tell it, and had probably told it often, if others would listen. And it was not so much that he wanted to be comforted as to understand why he had been confused, why he had climbed down and let some other take his place.</p>
<p>For at that moment, the Mexican had lost his peace, like a coin dropped from his pocket, and now he wanted to make it good. He wanted for there to be chances, possibilities, likelihoods—that would crowd it out or give it purpose&#8211;prospects and options; he wanted assurance that there would be field upon field to work through; and even if he had not done this, he could yet do that—even if not all was accomplished today, then there was still the day to come. Most of all—if indeed he had failed, there would yet be successes.</p>
<p>For now he is caught in the storm, Juan Julio, and for now he cannot see his way clear. It worries him—which is why his clothes are so clean, his hair brushed so well. Yes, he was always earnest, but he is more so now; he is meticulous to a fault, now. The Mexican will let nothing spill, will leave not a scrap of trash. His men must follow every rule, and his rigor with time is that of a saint. He is prepared, alert. In his mind, he is forever telling himself where he is, what he is doing, what he is yet to do – so that he will not be caught out again; so that he will not be found dreaming.</p>
<p>But he had time to atone; he should know that. The more and longer he lived, the more he could tell the tale, again and again, until his labors drove it from his mind. That was what Dr. Priest wanted to say; that peace he could bring the man, and would when he returned: that he had time. There were years yet, barring some other fate – years in which he could work. Years for someone to expect him, and for his sheer toil to make over, reclaim, build back. He could set this bone for a bone that could not be set, cut out this mass for the one too large to cut, apply this pressure (heel of hand on back of hand, and heel of hand on wound) for that which could not be dammed. Raise the near dead, for the dead that could not be raised.</p>
<p>For he has seen its face, what every man fears. He was the one they clutched after realizing, at last, that love alone could not save them – not their wives or husbands or children, but him – only him – when blood and history and friendship held no power against a rampant disease, a failing heart, time. And he would rise at such a thing, his muscles taut and tight; he would rise at what they believed of him – and talk to them like an angel with a sword in his mouth.</p>
<p>Now, the days are full of skies that will not rain, that beg a purpose they are not given. And he will not be let to answer, not be let to offer or speak, test or try. Like a horse in a barn that sees a field through his door, he stamps at his place. Though he has legs still, and a heart, and lungs and blood, he will not be let to run over it, not even to stumble and fall.</p>
<p>Now he rises at night, ready, prepared, if only they will let him; he looks for a task, for a thing to make right, for succor to bring. If they would let him. He hunts the corners of the house, the places of recess, as if they hold a discovery, a mute cry, fraught eyes.</p>
<p>He could be ready; he would need little. He had restored a man’s wind with a pen knife; he had tied off a vein with some twine.</p>
<p>They must be let through, he had decided. The lines must be let through – to carry answers, voices, questions put. Though they damaged and distorted the living – broke between the green, pulsing world with their naked purpose – their way must be cleared, given place. They ran between things, and they must be prepared, to stand and wait for their time. They must be ready, as he was, always – even now – to say to those who called, who held up the bright, red water of their need: be still – bring me the light; hold it here; this is the way.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There she is. A paper doll of me. The dress, the lilt, the self-hatred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd thins and swells in want of a scene. Conversations begin, pretend, then halt. My gin and tonic sweats into my hand and I lick at the moisture. Brows furrow with tension. I listen to leaves fall in a forest far from here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handsomely, he steers her around the room. The way he puts his arm around her, tries to fold her into approval, I measure his devotion. I know the weight of that hand, the shape of the fingers. The deep crevices. The cold it carries. It traveled my pale shoulder, my hand, the small of my back. It traveled me first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My arm twitches a little, homesick for that touch. I’ve never known a crowded room to be so empty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way she leans into his hand, the click of her boots against the floor, I measure the depth of his love. Her boots are a worn shade of black, shining buckles glint like razorblades, sutures of laces along the side. A deep chocolate, mine are higher heeled and sharper toed. Zippered with knowledge. She steps deliberately, with an ease I wish weren’t there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hasn’t gotten to her. Yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the words he whispers to her in the dead of night. When no one else is there to hear, I do. I know the heat of his breath, how the words warm with innovation. I know too, they’ll leave her alone and misshapen. The way he folds and creases us, bends and shapes us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are napkins into swans, paper into flowers, two into one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talk, she and I, in the corner, under a blanket of watchful, nervous eyes. We gush, anxious to dance around any acknowledgement of him. Her mouth is larger, thoughts smaller.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is perfecting this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has she seen the jelly jar beneath his bed? I don’t ask. Has he shown her how he bottles his love? I can not tell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight loves so far. Eight souvenirs. From eight paper people. Sameness swimming in a pink pickling solution. Not unlike the jar of olives in the kitchen. Not unlike those at roadside stations fat with briny eggs. Knotted pig knuckles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, she’s seen the knives. Used them to cut fruit for breakfast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the way he will lay her down, wear her down, hold her down as he finally declares his love for her. She’ll close her eyes, lean her head back, each limb a moccasin against a writhing other, until she doesn’t know her body from his. She won’t feel the slice. Not at first. He loves her. Confusion will come at the sight of sheets soaking red. But he loves her so. When the pain arrives, she’ll bear it, she’ll marry it, she’ll try to become worthy of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A part missing becomes such a small thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She’ll make nine. Just one away from a perfect ten.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing else between us, she says she likes my boots. I smile, knowing time will be marked from the day of severance. She’ll believe the relationship is a thing to cleave.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I reach out. Touch the soft of her arm. Affirm how lucky she is before I hobble on. My boot hardly pinches—not anymore—the place my toe used to be.</p>

<p>The long summer twilight filters through the leaves of the birch trees in the front yard, throws lacy patterns on the yellow walls of the bedroom. In a jar next to my bed, the fireflies my brother and I caught earlier in the evening crawl up and down the glass, their light gradually fading. The dormer window, an eye onto the open world, frames swallows winging past. Through the wall, I hear my mother crying, my father’s low tones. But this is better than last time, when they fought in my room and I pretended to be sleeping. And it will be better than next time, my eighth birthday, when I will fall asleep to the sound of their arguing and wake to find that it’s snowed during the night and my mother is gone. Giant icicles hang from the eaves, break free and plunge into the drifts. Until I leave for college—and even sometimes now, at twilight, or just before I wake—she is heels clicking down the sidewalk, a dark-haired woman turning away to light a cigarette.</p>
<p>You and I met in Bangkok, there to report on the refugees flooding in from Myanmar. It was a year later, when we went to Havana to write about people who’d tried to escape, that we found out I was expecting. I’d filed the story and you’d finished taking the photos; we were talking over lukewarm Cristal beers in the dingy, deserted hotel dining room. “In spite of how things might seem, history doesn’t have to repeat itself,” you told me.  We went walking along the Malecon promenade next to the sea. A storm was rising: clouds scudded across the sky in the time-lapse photography that was one of your specialties, the illusion of quick forward movement. Waves crashed over the sea wall onto the road. <em>Move back</em>, a policeman shouted, <em>es muy peligroso</em>. But we stayed where we were, you with your arm tight around me, telling me everything would be all right, the salt water cascading over us, starfish and seaweed tangling in my hair, the hair of a woman washed up from a shipwreck.</p>
<p>I live alone now in Japan, a place that suits me, an island country of walls made from stone, frosted glass, paper screens, glances, what is left unsaid. I couldn’t write any more about the nomads of the earth, so instead I travel around Japan reporting on mountain fire festivals, regional seafood specialties, the best traditional inns. Winter is my favorite season: the mournful song of the <em>yaki-imo</em> sweet potato vendor winds through the streets; snow slips with soft thuds from the stone lantern in the garden; rows of red-aproned <em>jizo</em> statues at the neighborhood temple are visible through the bare trees. The bodhisattva Jizo protects dead children as they travel through the underworld, the temple priest told me. It was as if he knew I’d decided to have the abortion after we returned from Havana, or like he knew something about my past, the way summer can turn to winter. Every day at twilight an old woman, her hair still black, shuffles up the stone walkway with an offering for the <em>jizos</em>: a pinwheel, candy. The priest has never seen her, but I know she is there. In the long hours of night, when I can’t sleep, I visit the <em>jizos</em> and make my own offerings: a lullaby, or sometimes just words. <em>Salt, snow, firefly</em>. Then I walk the city, lose myself in the indigo canyons of evening.</p>
<p>The last time I saw you, we were at the apartment you kept in Paris, the walk-up in the Marais where you stayed between shoots. Blue storm light spilled in through the tall windows; children ran laughing and shouting in the park, their calls twisting away in the wind, voices from my childhood. You talked about communication, about love and trust. I turned away, lit a cigarette. Stared into the lowering blue. Why hadn’t I kept quiet? You’d always said we could weather anything and I’d wanted to believe you, but the ties we have to other people were, after all, too tenuous. The understanding hopelessly incomplete. A random memory swam around, surfaced. “In Havana, I learned that in Spanish there are different words for ‘inner’ and ‘outer’ wall,” I said, turning to face you. “<em>Pared</em> means inner, and <em>muro</em> is outer.” You gazed at me with . . . compassion? Pity? Hatred? After a long silence, you said, “There’s a wall around your heart.” I saw the wall then: stone, encircling, with ramparts. Sightseers walking along the top, marveling at the great pulsing heart at the center. Shaking their heads in wonder, murmuring to one another: <em>Who ever really knows what we are capable of accomplishing?</em> But you see, that wall is a good thing. Some people don’t realize that we need walls to survive. Without them, we’re animals set free, huddling together in the middle of the open plain; we’re words begging for the form of a sonnet, a prayer. It’s something I’ve always known, a lesson I’m lucky to have learned early in life.</p>
