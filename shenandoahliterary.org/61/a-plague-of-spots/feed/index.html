					<description><![CDATA[To be frank, I have a lack of exposure to non-fiction featured in literary magazines like reviews and essays. I am quickly realizing novels and short stories dominate my view of literature, and I need to broaden my horizons. However, John Gamel’s essay, “A Plague of Spots” requires minimal expertize to recognize the purpose of the essay and his personal antidote. From the beginning, (“I have endured the Scotch-Irish curse of spots”) Gamel clearly establishes the themes and subject of the essay. Also, provided the author’s medical background, the reader expects more scientific jargon to be weaved into the personal account. The essay sheds light on the personal side and internal motivations of medical doctors. Gamel commences with a childhood memory and appeals to all readers. He writes:
My anxieties lay dormant for three years, until I examined a young law student who had dark nodules scattered beneath his skin, nodules that had spread from a melanoma on his scrotum. The poor victim was my age, almost to the day, and in the rush of an instant, this dreadful coincidence set my old obsession aflame.

The paragraph exemplifies the overall style and subject of the story. The primary illness in the story is Gamel’s anxiety and shame of his freckles, spots; thus, like melanoma or another skin disease “anxieties lay dormant.” He concludes the paragraph with a similar juxtaposition of medical terminology and psychological fear (“set my old obsession aflame”). Through this melding of accessibility and significance, Gambel formulates an accessible, but profound piece.]]></description>
