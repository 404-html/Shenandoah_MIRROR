					<description><![CDATA[Like Ms. Byer, I&#039;d never miss a Heaney book either!  Though my reasons are perhaps more complex: http://diannblakely.com/newupdate/uxorious.html.

While the titles above are all of interest, there&#039;s one to which I&#039;d especially like to point: *Copperhead*, by Rachel Richardson, my former student at the Sewanee Young Writers&#039; Conference.  In fact, I&#039;m glad to see this page still allows comments, for I&#039;ve three links and some information I&#039;d like to post: Rachel grew up in Berkeley but has--as will be obvious to anyone who reads her début collection, which I recommend wholeheartedly, a rarity for me--deep familial ties to both Louisiana and the Deep South&#039;s biracial culture.  I read *Copperhead* in manuscript and was impressed, in particular, by the &quot;Signage&quot; prose poems; Rachel has learned her lessons from Rich and C.D. Wright so well that by now, what their poems teach, she has thoroughly assimilated and made her own.  I&#039;m happy to offer three links and will hope for more readers of *Copperhead*, for that&#039;s my sole intent; Rachel, with Emma Bolden, remains among the three most talented students I&#039;ve ever been privileged to have in my classroom: http://swampland.com/articles/view/title:notes_on_the_state_of_poetry_part_three and http://blog.bestamericanpoetry.com/the_best_american_poetry/2011/06/the-new-black-by-diann-blakely.html and http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/243619567?auto_login_attempted=true

Thank you, R. T. Smith!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Rod, thanks for this new feature.  It&#039;s a valuable introduction to work I might otherwise have missed, though of course I&#039;d never miss a new Heaney collection.  I especially appreciate your words about this book, and I&#039;m glad there is no &quot;tour de force&quot; poem in it.  Just quiet, masterful poems.
   Thanks, too, for the introduction to Richardson&#039;s poetry.  I&#039;ll have to track it down.
    Gracias, too,  for the plug for the new Southern Poetry Anthology&#039;s Appalachian issue.  I, too, am surprised that Dianne Gilliam Fisher isn&#039;t in it.  I wish that Marita had been able to update her anthology before it was published; still, it&#039;s a valuable resource.]]></description>
