					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] November 25th, 2014   My book review of poet Steve Scafidi&#8217;s book To the Bramble and the Briar is posted at Civil War Monitor: LINK   I hope the review will draw new readers to this beautiful work, especially among people who normally aren&#8217;t interested in poetry. If you&#8217;re into 19th century America and / or Civil War, I think you&#8217;ll be intrigued by these interpretations — new and yet deeply authentic to the time and place.  Some of the poems were previously published as the Lincoln Poems in blackbird and Shenandoah. [&#8230;]]]></description>
