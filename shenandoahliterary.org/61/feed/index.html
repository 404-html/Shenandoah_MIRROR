								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The older Girl Scouts kick out the screens of their bunkhouse at night and wander the open fields at the back part of the ranch.  They often walk down the dirt road my cabin is on to get to the horse pasture.  I can see them in the dark.  They move like timid deer &#8212; taking quick dashes ten yards at a time and stopping to assess the night around them.  They betray themselves by laughing when one bumps into the other.  I keep my porch light off so I can see the stars.  The girls never pay attention to my cabin tucked along the tree line or me on the deck as they line up along the fence, stepping on the first plank to lean over the top and coo to the horses.  They wave carrots and apples they&#8217;ve hoarded from the mess hall.  I like watching this &#8212; the slow saunter of the horses approaching and nuzzling the girls, their movements breaking the stillness of the night, fireflies touching the space around them like thin blue flames.</p>
<p>By morning, the undertow of the mountain will have pulled the girls back to their bunks, and the horses will be slick with dew, and honey-colored in the pasture.  The bear grass will bloom like fists of light pounding up the hillside, and by afternoon, rainstorms will darken the sky and strike the ground with lighting before blowing over and leaving this calm I have only felt in the mountains.</p>
<p>My boss Joe rents the horses from an outfit called Sombrero that lets them free-range in the mountains during the fall and winter.  The horses are all starved and half wild by spring when they come to the Girl Scout Ranch.  Joe had us wait by the horse trailers when they arrived to send back the ones we thought were too sick.  If we could fit a dime between its protruding ribs we wouldn&#8217;t let it off the trailer, and the ones we kept had to spend two weeks being retrained by the wrangler girls.    So when a wrangler calls this morning from the stable and says an old horse has died, Joe says, &#8220;You fellas misjudged one,&#8221; and we have to go out in the rain to get the dead horse before the campers see it.</p>
<p>Joe drives us to the pasture, which runs along an incline with a large cup of earth surrounded by lodgepole pines with rainwater pooling over the roots.  My coworker Kurt says that later in the summer the rain washes away the topsoil down to the clay, &#8220;and the clay gets slicker than snot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurt and I take the tractor into the pasture.  It&#8217;s slow going &#8212; the wheels can hardly catch in the mud.  Just into the trees lies a dark brown Quarter Horse.  Its head is sloped downwards enough to see a row of yellow headstone-shaped teeth.  Its unfurled tongue lies on the ground like a dull pink ladle.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d be better off just letting the mud swallow the damn thing,&#8221; Kurt yells over the engine noise.</p>
<p>The other horses are in the open part of the pasture. But the one they call  &#8220;All-But&#8221; is watching us through the trees.  All-But has everything but one eye.  The eye he has is a piercing cloudy blue.  That blue eye is on us as Kurt ties a sheepshank knot to bind the dead horse&#8217;s back legs together.  He hooks a chain to the knotted rope and loops the chain on the back of the tractor where I stand as Kurt drives.  He eases the tractor forward slowly so he won&#8217;t tear off the legs.  When the chain is taut, he leans on the gas, and the old horse pivots from the pot of earth it died in.  Once we get it out of the trees it starts sliding easily over the wet mud.  As it runs over jagged rocks I notice chunks of the hide and meaty patches of the horse&#8217;s side left behind.  Joe holds the gate open for us so none of the other horses can get out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drag it as far into the woods as you can, and toss some brush cover over it,&#8221; Joe says.  He has on a mesh baseball cap and the beads of rain are running down the back of his neck.  The cold does not change his posture or his directness.  He seems like he&#8217;s done everything a hundred times.  Kurt drives past the horse barn toward the woods, away from the little girls&#8217; cabins.  On the gravel and root path going east along the mountain, the horse&#8217;s body gets caught on a broken root that gouges under its ribcage and snares it like a fishhook.  We change the knot and tie another one to its front feet to pull it loose.  Dragging it by the front leaves the head swinging backward at an awful angle, and I watch the neck snap as we drive, making a quick &#8220;pop&#8221; that breaks through the steady tractor noise.</p>
<p>Where the gravel road opens up into a small field, a group of girls hiking single file between two counselors emerge from the woods bordering the camp property.  They all stare with big open mouths at what we&#8217;re dragging until the counselors make them turn their backs to us like they do on the road when we pass, so our truck doesn&#8217;t throw dust in their face.  As the tractor passes them I see how the rain slides off their hoods in little rivulets, and I hope none of them turn around to look at the horse again.</p>
<p>We untie it in the woods at the end of the camp property.  The hide has been scraped raw, and the last ten yards of mud we move it through is blood-smeared.  This high up there is too much bedrock to bury it, so we use jigsaws to cut away at the surrounding trees&#8217; lowest branches and pile them over the horse until we can no longer see its mangled form.  Part of me feels like we should light the pile on fire.  I ride on the back of the tractor as we return the way we came.  The last of the rain washes the copper-red blood marks and clumps of horse fur away from the trail.  The sun is breaking through the clouds.  Sunlight gushes up the hillside as if trying to memorize the contours of every jagged stone.  Already turkey vultures are flying in wide spirals above the slope we left the horse on, the black finger of their beaks tracing the mountainside.  The birds cut through the sky like they are scrolling something on the mountain&#8217;s thermal updrafts &#8212; a language of nature&#8217;s neatness, its cycles, of wind speaking of life on the mountain.</p>

The space was cramped and airless, so someone&#8217;s leather satchel propped open the heavy door. Four scholars had just delivered papers on the effects of literary patronage in the modernist era, and during the lively question period the group discussed contemporary versions of the phenomenon: how universities have become North American poetry&#8217;s most significant supporters, for example, and the effects of corporate patronage from grant-giving foundations. The limited bounty is distributed unevenly, with many strings attached, as largesse always has been, but it remains very difficult for a poet to keep working and reaching appreciative audiences without such aid. Cynthia Hogue, a specialist in poetry by American women, acknowledged these conditions when she referred to the adage that the best work eventually rises to the top regardless of how resources flow. “We know that’s not true,” she said. Half of the people present sighed. Although there is some correlation between canonicity and the power of the verse, the more one reads, the more exceptions one finds. It also becomes obvious that reception shapes poetry as it is being produced. A few poets are brilliantly ruthless competitors who claim starring roles in the stories now being told about contemporary writing. Others pretend to ignore the jockeying completely; most occupy some ambivalent middle ground. The consequence for a passionate poetry reader is that one has to keep sitting in a series of small rooms, wedging the door open, hoping for a signal and leveling arguments about why the poetry one loves deserves better accommodations.</p>
<p>Cynthia Hogue has co-edited influential anthologies and published distinguished works of scholarship; these writings advance her own passionate arguments on behalf of the poetry she loves. She has also published six poetry collections, won major awards and earned an endowed chair at Arizona State University. In the competition for patronage, she has fared better than most. Still, her own verse is not as widely known as it ought to be. <em>Or Consequence,</em> Hogue’s 2010 collection from Red Hen Press, occupies a space between the various schools and movements that undergird contemporary poetic reputations and shape the field’s controlling narratives. <em>Or Consequence</em> develops many of the obsessions percolating through Hogue’s previous books, but it also takes an analytic turn. It is Hogue’s most ambitious collection in its multilayered pitch for human and aesthetic connection. Such bridges are sustained, according to Hogue, by the partial, precarious, and yet profoundly important stories we tell about ourselves and others.</p>
<p>HOGUE BEGAN PUBLISHING poetry in the eighties, oscillating between mystical lyricism and a fierce poetry of witness. Her first book, <em>When Parallels Cross</em> (Whiteknights Press, 1983), a limited edition fine press publication in England, is now difficult to find, although Hogue reworks and expands the material nearly two decades later for <em>Flux</em> (New Issues Press, 2002). <em>Woman in Red</em> (Ahsahta Press, 1989) continues her exploration of myths and folktales, particularly narratives about predation and the dangers girls and women face, but in a looser, more direct style. The poems in <em>The Never Wife</em> (Mammoth Press, 1999), her next collection, are more powerful and more controlled in their handling of similar material. Assault and violent death are recurrent subjects; a sequence about New Orleans in the early nineties is particularly memorable, as is the elegy “Domestic Memorial” and the darkly funny “Epithalamium.” These early books also echo with references to Hogue’s touchstone poets, particularly Emily Dickinson, whose phrases and fascinations continue to resonate in Hogue’s recent work.</p>
<p>The mystical and surreal strain in Hogue’s poetry emerges vibrantly in the wonderful collection <em>Flux</em>. This book, containing Hogue’s most sound-driven and perhaps her most elliptical poetry, layers the landscapes of Iceland and the American Southwest so that they seem strangely akin in their desolation &#8212; dreamlike places of death, birth and other transformations. For one character, “sound becomes a trail,” epitomizing the intertwined motifs of listening and traveling as Hogue follows language to its mysterious sources. She explores the idea and the origins of voice more deliberately and intellectually in <em>The Incognito Body</em> (Red Hen, 2006), another especially beautiful book.  <em>The Incognito Body</em> begins with the oracle at Delphi, ends with psalms and centers on the profoundly dislocating experience of major illness. The book’s fragmentary title sequence engages the intense chronic pain of rheumatoid arthritis in both a theoretical and a visceral way. Hogue juxtaposes passages in meter and rhyme with blocks of scientific prose, capitalizes bits of words to suggest surprising correspondences &#8212; messages buried within messages &#8212; and uses shifting margins to represent a radically divided self. The scholar Elaine Scarry, whom Hogue quotes in an epigraph, has influentially argued that pain destroys language, but while Hogue dramatizes this ruin by repeatedly breaking the lyric spell she is so good at casting, she also questions Scarry’s premises. Pain, Hogue’s poetry implies, magnifies a division that is always a part of human experience. We are bodies, but we also exist through language and dream, translating our senses’ sybil-line pronouncements in shifting, contradictory ways.</p>
<p>The boundaries of the self, the experience of consciousness, and the tricky business of representing selfhood become the chief material of <em>Or Consequence</em>. This is a humane book about having survived pain and found joy, by a person deeply interested in continuities and ruptures between past and present; its poems explore borderlands and liminal places with an emphasis on connection rather than division. One of its most surprising aspects is how it encompasses both philosophy and autobiography, intellectual exploration and examination of feeling, especially love. Or Consequence is full of medium-length poems that accrue force through the complexity of juxtaposed ideas more than through the resonance of interwoven sounds. The collection is thus less lyrical than her earlier books, stretching the mode to embrace an unusually wide scope: Hogue’s poetry considers &#8212; with appropriate measures of skepticism, humor and kindness &#8212; what it means to be a twenty-first-century citizen of the United States.</p>
<p>To start with the middle: the second of the book’s three sections, “New Orleans Suite,” calls back to Hogue’s earlier writing about that city and provides a counterpart to her recent collaboration with photographer Rebecca Ross in <em>When the Water Came: Evacuees of Hurricane Katrina</em> (UNO Press, 2010). “Arseniad” tells the extraordinary tale of a woman, referred to in court documents as “Arsene (alias Cora),” who traveled to France as a slave with her owners in 1836 and automatically became, by French law, a free person. Eight years later, back in New Orleans, Arsene’s former owner tried to sell her as chattel. She sued for her liberty, won the case, and disappeared from historical record. It is enormously problematic for a white poet to represent the experience of a former slave who can no longer speak for herself. Arsene exists now only in secondhand accounts, preserved in an archive. Hogue conveys respect by carefully distinguishing fact from conjecture and directly acknowledging her distance from Arsene: “My words cannot find her / or become her.” Hogue’s deference could squash the vitality of the poem, but it doesn’t; instead, she preserves a sense that Arsene was a real person, irreducible to a symbol and celebrates her triumphant escape from representation in poetry or definition by racist law. Hogue also recreates the shiver an archival researcher feels when history becomes intensely present, if only momentarily. “Arseniad” invites readers to share Hogue’s sense of uncanny, improbable connection to Arsene.</p>
<p>Other pieces in “New Orleans Suite,” set after the hurricanes and their terrible aftermath, deepen the meaning of Arsene’s escape and complicate “Arseniad”’s evocation of the archive. Two ekphrastic poems allude to “Floodwall,” artist Jana Napoli’s installation built from hundreds of salvaged empty bureau, desk and cabinet drawers. Both Napoli and Hogue focus on what has been lost. In “Seeking as in: Sign (Silence),” Hogue can’t even find Napoli’s installation and wanders around New York on a February night asking after Liberty Street. In her journey she first avoids and then returns to speak to a homeless veteran before finally discovering the wreckage of another twenty-first-century disaster: the absence that is Ground Zero. Hogue represents the contemporary United States as a marred, unjust place, but her response is to keep looking for connection and trying to make meaning. “The Green Card Is Not Green,” another multi-part poem near the end of the book, is a terrific example. Hogue mocks the absurdly empty language of bureaucracy and details the impediments to real exchange the U.S. government creates:</p>
<p>I enter a strange country<br />
and myself become strange. Étrangère.<br />
At that moment, my Resident Alien husband becomes Citizen.<br />
We are, between us,<br />
two beings of determinate but shifting identities,<br />
always in transit, self-shifting,<br />
one of us word-less,<br />
one of us defined by prohibitions. . . .<br />
You are invited to submit<br />
an application for an extension<br />
of the red tape in which to encase<br />
your green card.</p>
<p>The latter experiences are grounded in marriage, a union between two separate beings &#8212; in this case French and American. Their romance, one bridge among many, is central to the collection.</p>
<p>These politically charged poems give Or Consequence heft, but the book also contains many pages of lyric meditation, particularly in the intermittent “Étude”s. The witty linguistic play of the latter poems teases out the speaker’s self-consciousness about language as a medium &#8212; imperfect, and yet an instrument of human connection. The most beautiful is “Étude (on Memory),” recounting a visit to the Loire Valley that reflects on its invasion in 1940:</p>
<p>Ramparts form a sheer wall<br />
of mossed granite, desiccate tufts<br />
on nubbed stone: the green will<br />
that was here gone to ground<br />
but around we walk on the crest<br />
in a driving wind. The grit in it<br />
force of it opens our coats,<br />
deepens the crag of cheek when you grin,<br />
reddens the freckles where your hair recedes.<br />
I hear my name called so clearly I glance back.<br />
It’s your voice but you aren’t there<br />
(a resonance or vibration the brain perceives),<br />
maybe the memory of having heard. . . .</p>
<p>The poem concerns a violent rupture of borders and describes a hard landscape, now full of graves and plaques. The wind even tears at this couple’s clothing, plucking away their bodily warmth. Nonetheless, several elements work to counteract the assault and repair the damage. Hogue weaves the lines together sonically through internal rhyme (ground/around), pararhyme (wall/will) and the reshuffled consonants of “crest” and “coats.” A voice haunts her, suggesting communication just beyond the threshold of perception. Most moving, though, are the links between the speaker and her vividly present companion, who mirrors the rugged terrain through his “crag of cheek.” The poem ends as his hand catches hers, “so/ cold I turn.” There is no denying the harshness of the environment and its effects on the couple, but Hogue emphasizes their bond nevertheless.</p>
<p>The title <em>Or Consequence</em> doesn’t compel my interest as thoroughly as the poems within. It does highlight causation, though, and how Hogue handles the costs and pleasures of narrative. In the final poem, “The Bridge,” she paraphrases Vaclav Havel, endorsing</p>
<p>. . .the refusal<br />
to live without meaning,<br />
without, finally, love,<br />
even in conditions as<br />
hopeless as ours. . . .</p>
<p>When Hogue dismantles words, sentences, truisms and patriotic rhetoric, she is critiquing the most pernicious uses of language around us, but that critique is only a first move, and not the most important one. She is also propping open doors, assembling material for monuments, and housing a truly constructive spirit of respect and connection. Politicians often seek to “control the narrative” more cannily and doggedly than they redress injustice, so it is understandable that many contemporary poets profoundly distrust story, right down to the level of syntax. Without it, though, there can be no arguments on behalf of love or art. A poem’s intimate room needs to stand ajar, signals beamed in and conversation spilling into the halls. Hogue’s poetics of generosity is so thoughtfully, deftly framed that she actually manages it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cal said come to the Neshoba County Fair, so Virginia is here, bathed in the garish light of the midway. The night air is thick with the rancid meat smell of too much warm breath, too many unwashed bodies packed close all around. Some brush against her as they pass, their skin hot and slick, and she crosses her arms over her chest, presses her fingers against the knobs of her shoulders. If only there were something she could throw over herself &#8212; a shawl, a shroud. Something heavy to weigh her down because she is too light, as if she has shed whole pounds in the last few hours. As if a part of her has gone missing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“What next?” she says to Cal, who has joined her in the midway, a beer &#8212; not his first &#8212; in his hand.</p>
<p>“Come and play a game,” Cal says. He heads off down the midway, and she has no choice but to follow. It is late July; it is Mississippi and Neshoba so fired up with liquor and love that the heat is tangible, alive, some monstrous thing with outspread wings pulsing down on them. Maybe she shouldn’t have come. Her first real outing in months and she should’ve started with a movie, a simple dinner out, a neighborhood park. Something lighter, something less gorged with noise and light and motion. She’s not used to all this walking, all this open air against the bare skin of her arms, her legs. What she’s used to is her cramped, two-room apartment back in Jackson where, for weeks now, she has sat for hours on end in the same position: cross-legged on the couch, a laptop on her thighs and her quick, lynx-like fingers pouncing on the keyboard, ripping over the keys &#8212; a hundred words per minute! &#8212; for this man sucking down a cheap beer beside her.</p>
<p>It’s because of him that she’s here, that she rode the hour and a half up to Neshoba in his lumbering white convertible. “A 1961 Pontiac,” he told her. “Get your feet off the dash.” Her feet weren’t on the dash. They were resting properly on the floorboard, but Cal pays no mind to details. Like when he showed up this afternoon on her doorstep in a clean, collared shirt and said, “Wash up. We got somewhere to be.” He hadn’t noticed then that she was already washed, that she’d smoothed back all her wild, curly hair, that she was dressed in a yellow cotton sundress (her mother’s, and she’d had to dig through four boxes just to find it). Nor did he notice that her bag was packed and sitting at her feet where she waited by the window, twisting the curtains in her hands. But then, Cal has no reason to notice these things. He is not her lover, not really her friend. Just a man who pays her to take notes, a man she has known only a few months, a drunk, a liar, and when he suggested this outing, when he asked her if she’d like to take a break from her note-taking, have some fun, she should have known better.</p>
<p>She does know better, in fact. But what choice does she have? She lost her job. She was forced to find a new one. She found Cal &#8212; or rather, he found her. It’s all her mother’s fault, really, like everything else. How easy it is to blame the absent, the vanished.</p>
<p>THEY MOVE THROUGH the crowd, the swirling light and noise, the shrill laughter and hoarse voices calling to them, to anyone: “Where you going, little mama? First toss is free!” Or, “I’d win you a pony, if you was mine. Come on back here, sugar.” It’s worse, for women, harder to say no. She would stop, if not for Cal. If not for Cal leading her on, she would be forced to obey these voices. She wouldn’t be able to help it.</p>
<p>They pick their way through sawdust sticky with spilled soda and vomit. They dodge clumps of manure and scraps of food &#8212; syrup-soaked biscuits and fried dough and smatterings of powdered sugar. The flies are everywhere; they come buzzing up around Virginia’s head, and she waves them away, forgets to watch where she walks and steps in an overturned cup of dip spit, which she doesn’t notice until they stop beside a small red tent with a sign: Cassandra, Ancient Palm-Reader.</p>
<p>“Is this next?” Virginia says.</p>
<p>“No.” Cal points to a sign one tent over. See the Walking Corpse of Neshoba County! the sign says, in thick black letters. And because Cal wants to, they will.</p>
<p>Four dollars a piece but, “She’s worth every penny,” says the man out front.</p>
<p>Inside, the tent is dim, lit red from the bulbs that line the big glass case in front of them. Inside the glass is a woman sitting on a stool, her legs crossed like a lady. An overhead light blinks on, throwing a blue beam over the woman’s legs, which appear normal enough to Virginia &#8212; nice, actually, smooth and toned. But, “that ain’t right,” Cal says, pointing at the woman’s feet, and Virginia sees that she is toe-less, the blue-lit flesh of her feet running off into nothing, into black. Another light blinks on, aimed at the woman’s hands, resting calmly in her lap, and it’s the same as the feet &#8212; the fingers missing, the hands ending at the knuckles, like balled fists almost &#8212; but when she flips them over, palm up, there’s nothing but smooth skin. Cartoon hands, round and seamless and incomplete.</p>
<p>“I got news for you,” Cal says to the man. “That ain’t a corpse.”</p>
<p>“No, sir,” the man says. “She’s even better. Watch this,” and at his cue, lights in all different colors illuminate the woman’s arms, her shoulders. “Look there,” the man says. “See that spot there beneath her elbow?” Virginia does see &#8212; a large, round area at the top of the woman’s forearm that, even as they watch, appears to be slowly vanishing, color and density fading out, fading into black.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with her?” Cal says.</p>
<p>“We’re not real sure,” the man says. “But whatever it is, it’s spreading.”</p>
<p>“Remember this, Ginny,” Cal says to Virginia. “So you can write it down later.”</p>
<p>But she’d prefer to forget.</p>
<p>IT WOULD BE easier for her to enjoy herself if she could shut off all those words running through her head, as if on loop. Not the sound of the words, not the voices, but the image of them on a page or a screen: small black letters, double-spaced with standard margins, standard blankness, one inch at the top and bottom, one inch on either side. Neat and tidy and always the same, always there. There must have been a time when they weren’t there, when she could see images, scenes, whole pictures, rather than just the letters themselves.</p>
<p>And they’re never her own words, always someone else’s. Most recently, they are Cal’s, his stories for her to type up, put together, make whole. Memoirs, he calls them, though he can’t be much more than thirty, no older than she is and too young for a real past. And most of what he tells her, she suspects, are lies. “I busted into a zoo,” he said once. “Stole the panther right from its cage.” Or, “One time, I blacked out for three whole weeks,” he told her. “When I came to, I was at Graceland.” He laughed then, and shook the hair from his eyes. “Imagine that, Ginny. I’d been making like I worked there, showing around the tourists.” And another time, very late at night when he was six or seven drinks in, “I stole a man down in Lucedale,” he said. “He was crazy as a loon, and I sold him to science. You wouldn’t believe all the things I done.”</p>
<p>She doesn’t believe, but doesn’t say so. She sits there, on the couch in her apartment where they do this work, a cup of coffee on the floor at her feet and a keyboard propped on her knees. She sits there, and she looks at him, at his unwashed hair that he tucks behind his ears, at his yellow-brown eyes, at the pale stubble above his lip and the dime-sized mole, dark and bristly, on his left cheek. She looks because it’s called for, because “It’s American,” her mother taught her, when she was a child. Her mother’s parents had come from Lebanon, but her mother was born “right smack in the middle of Alabama,” and never let anyone forget it. “In America,” she would say, “you look people in the eye, or they’ll think you’re scared of them. You look at people when they talk to you.” And Cal is always talking.</p>
<p>But, “Stop eyeing me and write that down,” he will say, breaking off mid-sentence. “What am I paying you for?”</p>
<p>Whatever it is, he isn’t paying much. A lot less, in fact, than she made typing for the doctors at St. Dymphna’s, where she’d been fired. And at St. Dymphna’s, she’d had health insurance, retirement, a bi-monthly paycheck rather than a fistful of damp, crumpled cash. But, for all that, she finds she doesn’t miss it. She doesn’t miss coiffing her hair every morning, sitting with her legs crossed like a lady at her desk. Nor does she miss the doctors and their jargon, words like diagnosis and malingering and psychosis that, by the time she left, were becoming more than letters on a page, were taking on real heft and bulk. The worst of these words, the most unwieldy, was the patient &#8212; always, in everything, the patient, the patient, over and over until she found herself jotting it down on napkins during her lunch breaks, or drumming it out against the table like it was a keyboard.</p>
<p>It made her tired, dragging those words along everywhere she went. So tired, finally, that she was sure her own mother had walked up to her desk and asked to have herself committed. Her mother, who’d disappeared six years ago, who’d taken the car and the big leather trunk that had held her grandmother’s trousseau and had left everything else behind &#8212; her jewelry and her boxes of letters and cards (some of them from her sisters, a note from Virginia in her crooked, childish handwriting: Happy Fourth of July!!!), her pretty, high-heeled shoes lined in rows at the bottom of the closet, and all the rest that Virginia had packed up and stored at her own apartment when the house went into foreclosure.</p>
<p>And here she was – her mother &#8212; this woman at Virginia’s desk with black hair and oily, olive skin and that look on her face &#8212; so familiar &#8212; the expression she used whenever one of her daughters questioned her, the firm, defensive mouth, black eyes askance. Gripping the edge of the desk with one hand and rummaging (always, she was rummaging) through her bag with the other, she whipped a license from her wallet &#8212; fake, it must have been &#8212; tapped the photo and, “You don’t understand,” the woman said, in her mother’s deep voice. “I don’t exist. I’m not real.”</p>
<p>“It was her,” Virginia told her sisters, over the phone.</p>
<p>“You’re tired,” they said.</p>
<p>“She pretended not to know me. But it was her.”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t her.”</p>
<p>Three months later, Virginia is still not sure.</p>
<p>AHEAD, CHILDREN ARE gambling. A boy stands atop a box at the roulette wheel, several bills fanned out on the table in front of him. Other boys crowd the table, their gap-toothed grins showing pink gums and tongues stained bright blue or red or green. There’s a girl squeezed in among them, her elbows propped on the table and her chin in her hands, a lot of orange-red hair falling over her face. She’s maybe eleven, twelve, with sleepy, half-closed eyes, and she curls her lip when Cal throws a wad of cash onto the table beside her. The boy-dealer hesitates only seconds before he sweeps the money into the cash box and pushes the chips at Cal.</p>
<p>“You play against children?” Virginia says. But she isn’t there to ask questions. And despite what Cal told her, she isn’t there to have fun &#8212; something she realized as soon as they arrived, when he slipped a notepad and a pen into her bag because “You never know what might happen.” She knew then why he brought her: so she could take note of what he does, in case he forgets.</p>
<p>“I want you to pay real close attention,” Cal says. “Burn this in your memory.”</p>
<p>So she bites her bottom lip and squints at the roulette table to reassure him, because she can’t lose this job, too; she can’t lose Cal. He’s not safe, she knows that. She knew it when she first met him, before he told her all his embellished past. She could tell by the look of him, by his thrown-on air, so disheveled and temporary, transient. Like he’s perpetually passing through, like every night is his first, or his last, and tomorrow he’ll be on his way somewhere better than Jackson, or Neshoba, better than all of the shadow that is Mississippi. At any moment, he could slip away. But when, late at night, he stretches his legs out over her couch, shakes his glass so that the ice tinkles and looks sideways at her with his yellow-brown eyes, she finds it comforting to write him into his stories, pin him down, diminish him to letters, symbols, words that she can organize and stow away. That, later, she knows just where to find.</p>
<p>The boy spins the wheel and the number is fourteen. Cal’s number. “No candy or whores for you,” he says, as he takes their money. One of the children has bet with a box of taffy, and Cal takes that, too. “Buck up,” he says to the woebegone faces, the stifled tears. “This ain’t a playground.” Then, “You got this, Ginny?” he says. “You paying attention?”</p>
<p>The orange-haired girl pushes back from the table. “I’m a fortune-teller,” she says.  “Mama says that’s different, but I think it’s sort of the same as a whore.” She glances up at them, at Cal, then Virginia and says, “I know what you’re up to.”  She wobbles for a moment, one hand over her mouth like she’s about to vomit, then she turns and disappears in the crowd.</p>
<p>“Who did she mean?” Virginia says. “You or me?”</p>
<p>“She’s drunk, is all.” Cal folds the money into his wallet &#8212; homemade with duct tape that he’d filched off his buddy, he told her &#8212; and tucks the wallet and the box of taffy into the bag slung over his shoulder. The bag is hers, and when he’d offered to carry it, she’d thought he was being gentlemanly. But now, she suspects he knew all along he’d fill the bag with money and candy and other loot he doesn’t trust her with, not the least of which are the keys to his precious Pontiac, jingling at the bottom.</p>
<p>She stares up at his long, narrow face, his sun-roughened skin and wonders if she would recognize him in a crowd. He looks so much like all the other cleaned-up men in jeans and button-down shirts, their sleeves rolled up over their tanned forearms and their hair combed back. How easy it would be for Cal to slip among them, to vanish for good.</p>
<p>“Don’t call me Ginny,” she says, though she knows he won’t listen; he won’t obey. It is always she who obeys him. It is always her bowing to his will, because what else does she have to do?  “Plenty,” her mother would tell her, if she were here. “A woman,” she would say, “should always have too much to do.” And yet, Virginia can remember the times when her mother did nothing, when she sat at the kitchen table with her hands twisted together in her lap to hide the raw, bleeding places where she’d picked the skin from her fingertips and her knuckles. Virginia can remember, and even worse is that, lately, Virginia has caught herself in the same posture. Hunched over the trunk she uses as a coffee table, her hands clenched together and her fingers &#8212; her long, slender fingers that she can never keep still &#8212; squirming like blind newborns, like the bald baby squirrels she finds fallen from the trees in her yard. And when she catches herself, she knows how she looks. Just like her mother, without the blood.</p>
<p>THEY TURN DOWN Happy Hollow, a cabin street nearly as crowded as the midway, with the cabins built close together and people spilling from porches into a narrow lane strewn with empty bottles and brightly colored children’s toys and pinwheels stuck here and there, spinning in the breeze of the outdoor fans. They’re all the same, these cabins, painted gaudy colors, bright blue, purple, yellow, red. All of them tall and skinny, their porches done up with string lights and American flags. Her mother would approve of the flags &#8212; so patriotic.<br />
Virginia is careful to keep to the middle of the lane, just out of reach of the cabin over-flow: the women draped over porch chairs and showing too much flesh in their tank tops and rolled-up shorts. Sticky-looking flesh, like if Virginia were to touch it, it would cling to her finger. And the men, slumped at their feet or on the porch steps, most of them shirtless, many picking guitars, some of them singing. The din of out-of-tune chords and harsh, slurred voices blends with the screams from the midway, the calling of the vendors, the music pumped through overhead speakers. They’re on fair grounds, but it’s like they’ve turned a corner and ended up in some tawdry village from a second-rate fairy tale.</p>
<p>These people &#8212; the villagers, she thinks of them &#8212; look up as she and Cal pass. Some call to her. “Where you staying, baby?” says a man with a shadowed face and deeply socketed eyes. “Come on back and sit a while.” It’s like a game, sticking to the middle of the lane, a game from childhood that she can almost recall &#8212; Valley of Death? &#8212; and if she steps just an inch more to the left or the right, one of them will grab her, draw her in and she will lose. Cal is playing, too, because he walks a straight line down the middle, just in front of her.</p>
<p>“Where are we going?” Virginia says.</p>
<p>He turns to face her. “To find a place to stay,” he says, his voice low. “Now, act like you belong.” Then he steps sideways out of the lane and into the arms of a fat, grinning woman.</p>
<p>CAL IS A big man, over six feet with a broad chest and an oversized head like a mastiff’s. But this woman, all her sun-burnt fat pillowing out from her tube top &#8212; this woman engulfs him. She wraps him up in a hug and whole parts of him, his face and his long, muscled back, disappear beneath all that flesh. So much flesh that it can’t all be her own, and Virginia, planted safe in the middle of the lane, runs her fingers over her stomach and below the hem of her dress to her bare thighs, as if making sure she’s all there. It’s the walking corpse she thinks of. How unfair it is that this fat woman should have so much extra, while back there behind the glass a poor, sick woman has less and less.</p>
<p>The missing fingers bother Virginia the most. Extremities, doctors call those. They’d love to get their hands on the walking corpse, all those doctors at St. Dymphna’s. They’d love to prove that it’s all in her head and her fingers and toes are there, if she’d only listen to them and take her medication. So smug, every one of them, so judgmental, because that’s what a diagnosis is, Virginia has learned, a judgment. A classic schizoid, they would scribble at the bottom of the charts. Text-book bi-polar. Borderline PS with typical paranoid tendencies. It was always the same, the same four or five diagnoses over and over until Virginia wondered if this was it, all there was to people, and, if so, which type was she?  She greeted these patients. She signed them in, knew their names. They were real, with all three dimensions, front, back and side, but to Virginia, their charts tucked neatly into files and their histories typed in tidy rows across clean white paper, each of them had the pressed, glossy quality of figures in a magazine. Like she could flip them with a finger, and they’d be gone.</p>
<p>“Come on, Ginny,” Cal says. The fat woman has him propped against the porch railing, and she’s running her fingers through his hair. On the porch behind them, among the lounging bodies and the out-flung limbs, are a group of small girls sitting cross-legged in a circle. One of them looks up, looks right at Virginia with heavy, bloodshot eyes &#8212; the girl from the roulette table. Virginia ducks her head, glances quickly away (it’s not polite to stare, her mother also taught her, and “Stop asking questions,” she said, when Virginia wanted to know how staring was any different from looking someone in the eye when they spoke to you). But she can feel the girl’s eyes on her, even when she has turned away. She can feel that girl, her gaze blank and calm as a corpse.</p>
<p>“What the fuck are you doing?” Cal says. “You’re blocking the lane.”</p>
<p>“That’s okay, baby.” A man steps around from behind her, a metal trash can in his arms. He sets it down at the foot of the porch steps, pulls off the lid. The inside, lined in plastic, is full of a dark, purplish liquid. “Have a drink,” the man says, dipping a paper cup into the can.</p>
<p>She shouldn’t. She rarely drinks. But she’s here, and there’s no going back, not without Cal, who’s beckoning to her from the porch. She can’t go up there, can’t act like she belongs without a little help, something to calm her. So she takes the cup, throws her head back and swallows the liquid all at once. It’s sweet, like Kool-Aid, with the sharp, medicinal aftertaste of some kind of alcohol. But not bad, and she takes a second cup, sips.  Something tickles her thigh. She lifts the hem of her skirt, and a black insect flies out. It lands on the sawdust a few feet away &#8212; a cricket, it looks like, or a large fly. How long had it been there? She rubs her thigh with her fingers and wonders if there are more up there that she can’t feel, crawling up and down her skin.</p>
<p>CAL COMES BARRELING down the porch steps and grabs her by the hand. It is the first time he has touched her, and his hand is cool and soft &#8212; softer than a man’s should be, a man like him. He pulls her up the steps and plunges them both among the mass of bodies and coolers and bottles and empty plates that cover every inch of the porch. The odor  is strong enough to taste &#8212; a stewed, over-cooked smell, like road-kill baking in sun. She’d like to cover her mouth with her hand to keep it back, to keep from breathing it down inside her. But Cal holds her from behind, his arms wrapped tight around hers as he pushes her along in front of him.</p>
<p>“You’re crushing me.”</p>
<p>“You’re embarrassing me.” He drops his head down over her shoulder, and his stubble tickles her cheek. “Now shape up and be good.” He squeezes her so tight that his pulse, the steady beat of his blood, thumps against her back.</p>
<p>“Let go,” she says, but she’d rather he didn’t. He’s solid and big, and he tethers her here, keeps her firmly on the ground. Without him, she would bounce around this place like a balloon. She would float at random, a fluff of hair, detached from its body, borne about by the wind. She tries to picture this image, tries to see herself as light as she feels &#8212; so light, like she’s fading away, being rubbed out, bleached like a stain.</p>
<p>“Why’s your mouth all purple?” Cal says, and the image is gone.</p>
<p>He pulls her along to the fat woman who stands at the threshold of the cabin door. “Is that your sweetheart?” the woman says.</p>
<p>“When she’s good. This is Rita,” Cal says, nodding at the fat woman.</p>
<p>The woman grins at Virginia. “Aren’t you pretty? Did you know, honey,” she says, “that he says he’s my brother and I didn’t recognize him?” Up close, her face is unnaturally smooth and without pores, as if covered in a layer of enamel. Nothing at all like Cal’s rough, uneven complexion. “I haven’t seen him in ten years,” she says. “I’m his sister, for Christ’s sake.”</p>
<p>Virginia hasn’t seen her own sisters for six years now, since they’d shown up to go through their mother’s things after she’d disappeared, when it was clear she wasn’t coming back. And she’s not sure what to say to this woman, so she says, “You don’t look like Cal,” and Cal’s hand clamps down on her shoulder.</p>
<p>“Listen, honey,” the woman says, “it ain’t my fault. I’ve been trying to find him. And he won’t tell me what he’s been up to. All he says is that I’ll find out soon enough.” She taps Cal’s chest with her finger. “What in heaven’s name does that mean?”</p>
<p>Virginia could tell her. She could offer up her files, her pages and pages of notes. All typed up, printed out and neatly stacked in the bottom of her panty drawer. Stowed away, out of sight, but still she sees them &#8212; the small, black letters running left to right, left to right, forming words meant to convey images: Cal posing as a magician in a jazz bar on Decatur Street, and Cal running naked through a swamp down in Pass Christian with the mud caked on his calves thick as leather chaps. But vividly as he describes these scenes, all Virginia ever sees are the shapes of the letters, the curving S’s and round O’s, the sharp points of a W or a capital A. Running through her head, spreading down a smooth, white page so much faster than she can type, left to right, down, down, so fast it makes her dizzy, and she steadies herself against Cal.</p>
<p>“Is she drunk?” Rita says.</p>
<p>“Ain’t everybody?”</p>
<p>“Well, she’s so skinny,” Rita says. “Probably doesn’t take much.”</p>
<p>“I’m not drunk,” Virginia says, but maybe she is, because the noise, the laughter, the screams and Rita’s fat, rich voice come in bursts, in pops and stutters, like a radio scanning stations. And the string lights on the railing appear to be melting, white light dripping down like wax. She turns away, closes her eyes and when she opens them, she catches the gaze from the opposite corner, two huge, light eyes aimed at her, piercing her, like they see, they know and they aren’t telling.</p>
<p>INSIDE, UPSTAIRS WHERE she lies on a thin blanket, Cal says, “You got to remember to write this down.” He sits beside her, his back propped against the wall. “Write down,” he says, “how the typist went into a swoon, like a lady in one of those movies, and how I carried her inside, like a hero.”</p>
<p>“That’s not what happened.”</p>
<p>“Write down,” he says, “how I saved her and how she was so grateful, she cried like a little girl.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t.”</p>
<p>“Well,” he says, “it’d be more interesting if you did.”</p>
<p>It’s dark in this room, hard to make him out. There are others in here, bodies they’d stumbled over on their way in, some asleep and snoring, others pawing at one another.  The rustle of sheets, the whispering and the heavy, drunken breathing seems all around, behind, beside, above her. Or is that her making that faint rippling sound, like the purring of a cat?</p>
<p>She sits up, her head spinning. The front of her dress is wet, stained purple from the drink she spilled. Her mother’s dress and twenty years old at least, but when Virginia cleaned out her mother’s closet, she found it hanging there in perfect condition, as if waiting for her mother to slip it back on.</p>
<p>“Get comfortable,” Cal says. “We’re staying the night.”</p>
<p>“Together?” She can’t imagine sleeping beside him. She can’t imagine him asleep at all. She wonders if he snores.</p>
<p>“Don’t get worked up,” he says. “I’ll keep my pants on.”</p>
<p>For a while, he’s quiet, which is odd, and she thinks he has fallen asleep. But then there’s the pop of a can opening, the soft fizz of foam, and when she turns to look, she can make out his long, dark shape where he sits against the wall.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” she asks him.</p>
<p>“Planning.”</p>
<p>Virginia sits up, faces him and, in a half-whisper, the words thrumming in her throat, finds herself telling him about her mother. She must be drunk, giddy, because she’s never told him anything before. He’s never asked.</p>
<p>“Did you look for her?” he says.</p>
<p>“I don’t think she wanted to be looked for.”</p>
<p>“I mean that second time. After she came back. Did you go after her? That’s what I’d do, if someone took off on me.”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t,” Virginia says. “They said it wasn’t her. They didn’t know who it was. What could I do?” She could stare, as it turned out, because that’s what she did. She gaped up at the woman for so long that, finally, the woman had stomped off past her, through the door to the patients’ wing. And even then, even when she had gone, Virginia sat at her desk, her hands clasped together to still her wriggling fingers and her mind, as if at a loss for any other way to make sense of what she’d just seen, spitting out letters: the cupped u of understand, the curled tail of the apostrophe in I’m, the crossed-hatched x and the tiny dot over the i in exist. That’s what she saw; that’s what she was still seeing when her mother reappeared with a doctor beside her, when they walked out the door of the building and disappeared.</p>
<p>“If it’d been me,” Cal says, “I would’ve followed her right out that door. I would’ve followed her till she owned up to who she was.”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t follow her,” Virginia says. “She didn’t want me to.” But she should have done something, acted in some way. She should have stood up at her desk and shouted “Mom, Mom, Mom,” or tried it in Arabic, “Ummu, Ummu, Ummu,” because her mother hated Arabic, and that would’ve been sure to piss her off, to get her attention. Because that was the worst of it, how she’d looked right at Virginia, right into her eyes, and didn’t seem to know her at all.</p>
<p>“Who gives a fuck what she wanted?” Cal says. “Sometimes, Ginny, you got to do what you want. Fuck everybody else.” He stretches out on the floor.</p>
<p>After a while, “Was that really your sister?” Virginia says. “That big woman down there?”</p>
<p>But he must be asleep already, because he doesn’t answer.</p>
<p>WHEN VIRGINIA WAKES up, the room is still dark, and Cal is gone. She throws her arm out over the blanket, gropes along the bare floor. It’s warm, as if he’d lain there only seconds ago. Her bag is gone, too, her bag with his money, his keys. But he can’t have deserted her. Why would he? It makes no sense; she’s got all his files, all his notes, his whole goddamned past. Surely, he’ll be right back. But her fingers pick at the blanket, twist and tug and want to claw right through.</p>
<p>She rises to her knees. From all around, from every corner, comes the sound of sleep, breath sucking in and out, steady and monotonous as the hum of an air conditioner. She tries to be still, to let the sound wash over her, lull her into submission, because what she wants to do is run from the room and out onto the porch and to wherever it is that Cal has gone. But that would be silly, because he’s probably only gone to the bathroom, or maybe to the kitchen &#8212; does this place have a kitchen? &#8212; to root for a snack. Or maybe he’s hunting up more loot, finding things he’d like to steal. She wouldn’t care. She wouldn’t care if he stripped the whole place down to nothing, as long as he came back.</p>
<p>But he does not come back. She sits there, picking at the blanket until she’s pulled the thread out from the hem. Then she stretches her stiff legs, smoothes her hair back with her fingers and goes to look for him.</p>
<p>The staircase is dark, so she clings to the railing &#8212; a rough, wooden rod that pricks her palm &#8212; until she reaches the bottom floor. There’s a light coming from a corner, a tiny gleam. She moves toward it, but halfway there, she stops. Just above the light, lit up from its blue-white glow, hovers the face of the red-haired girl.</p>
<p>“What do you want?” the girl says. It’s a book light that she’s got, stuck into the spine of a paperback.</p>
<p>“Have you seen that man?” Virginia says. “The tall man I was with before?”</p>
<p>The girl snaps the light off, and the room goes black. Virginia is aware, suddenly, of how dry her mouth is. “Could you turn that back on?” she says.</p>
<p>“I seen him,” the girl says, into the dark. “I know where he’s gone.”</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>When the girl answers, her voice is much closer. So close that her breath, cool and odorless, touches Virginia’s face. “He’s gone to fuck my mother.”</p>
<p>Something sharp pokes Virginia in the side, and she realizes that she has stumbled sideways against a table corner. “Turn the light back on,” she says.</p>
<p>The girl’s hand, hot and wiry, closes on her arm. “I’ll prove it,” she says. “I’ll show you.”</p>
<p>The child is crazy, probably, some backwoods offspring of the Delta. Or drunk, maybe even stoned. Virginia should shake her off, go back upstairs, wait for Cal to come back. If he’d wanted her to follow him, he would’ve told her. But, as if sucked into a current, she finds herself following this girl out onto the porch, down the porch steps and into the lane.</p>
<p>Outside, it is lighter, all the string lights and neon cutting through the dark. It must be far past midnight, and the crowd has thinned along Happy Hollow. Those still awake slump in lawn chairs, cups in their hands. Some have dragged blankets and sleeping bags out onto the porches. Ahead, a bare-chested man in torn jeans sprawls across the lane. There’s blood on his face, and a broken bottle clutched in his hand. “He’s okay,” the girl says, and they step over him.</p>
<p>They reach another cabin street &#8212; Sunset Lane, according to the sign &#8212; and turn right.</p>
<p>“Listen,” Virginia says. “Do you know Cal?”</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>“The man. The man you’re taking me to.”</p>
<p>“No.” The girl pushes the mess of hair back from her face. “But when I seen him, I knew right off what he was up to,” she says. “I knew what he wanted. And she promised! She promised she wouldn’t whore herself out no more.”</p>
<p>“How did you know?”</p>
<p>The girl stops in front of a bright blue cabin. She turns her face up to Virginia. “I know lots of things,” she says. This close, her eyes are a strange, pale gray, enormous and wavering, as if magnified through water. She points at the blue cabin. “They’re in there,” she says. “Go on.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you coming?” She can’t go in there without the girl to guide her.</p>
<p>“You think I want to see that?” the girl says. “I seen enough of that. I don’t want to see no more.”</p>
<p>But Virginia does. It boils up from the pit of her stomach, this sudden, overwhelming desire to witness Cal in the act. From what he’s told her, he’s been with a woman from every family in Jackson, but Virginia can never picture it. She can never picture any of his stories, or anything else for that matter, and this time there will be more than words for her type, more than the shapes and symbols. This time, she’ll see it for herself, whether he likes it or not.</p>
<p>IT’S DIM INSIDE the cabin, and so quiet a that at first she thinks the girl has tricked her, that there’s no one here. But then, from upstairs, comes a dull thud, like a fist pounding the wall, and then another thud, thud, thud. Virginia moves toward the noise, but half-way up the stairs the sound of Cal’s voice, high and cracked, makes her pause: “Goddamn liar!” he shouts. “Fuck you! Fuck you!” She has never heard him like this, and she waits for him to say something else. But he doesn’t, so she moves on.</p>
<p>When she reaches the landing, she doesn’t have to go far, because there’s an open door to the left, and with a lot of light spilling out into the narrow hall. Inside the room, bathed in all that bright light, is Cal. He’s half naked, Virginia’s bag slung over his bare shoulder, his boots and shirt clutched to his chest. His hair, stiff with the pomade he’d used to slick it back, juts in crazy spikes all over his head, and his face is contorted with emotion &#8212; his lip curled, jaw clenched, all the tendons in his neck standing out. He’s glaring at a woman &#8212; the girl’s mother, it must be, the same red hair – who’s stretched naked on a tiny cot, her white legs dangling over the edge and onto the floor. There’s something familiar about those legs, and Virginia feels as if she has seen them before, has examined their length and shape.</p>
<p>“Five hundred dollars!” Cal says. “For what? To fuck a regular woman, when I could buy that for fifty.” He is out of breath, his words coming out with loud puffs of air. “I want a refund. I want every penny of it back.”</p>
<p>“Why?” the woman says. She sits up, pulling the sheet to her chest.</p>
<p>“You fucking lied to me. That’s why.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t lie.”</p>
<p>Cal stomps barefoot over to the cot. He grabs the woman’s ankle and lifts her foot. “What’s this?” he says. “Your goddamn toes, that’s what.” He drops her foot and reaches for her hand. “And those are your fucking fingers. One, two, three, four, five of them. I paid to fuck something special. A vanishing woman is what I paid for.”</p>
<p>Virginia knows now where she has seen those legs. But the last time, they hadn’t ended in curled pink toes.</p>
<p>“Go ahead,” the woman says. “Squeeze as hard as you can. Break my hand, if you want. I can’t feel it.”</p>
<p>Cal throws her hand aside and stoops to pull his boots on.</p>
<p>“Smash my toes with your heel,” the woman says. “Go on. Burn me with a cigarette. Hell, stick a knife through my palm. It doesn’t matter.”</p>
<p>“You’re fucking crazy,” Cal says, and then, without warning, he comes barreling out the door. Virginia has just enough time to duck back into the dark hall as he rushes past. She waits for the clomp of his boots to fade off down the stairs, waits for the porch door to slam, and then, slowly, she stretches her neck out to peek inside the bedroom.</p>
<p>The woman, the walking corpse, stands in full view of the doorway, the sheet wrapped around her. “What do you want?” she says, and Virginia freezes there, caught in her crouch.</p>
<p>“I see you,” the woman says. She gathers up the bottom of the sheet and walks to the doorway. “Get up,” she says, standing over Virginia. “Get up. You look ridiculous.”</p>
<p>For a moment, Virginia only blinks up at her. Then, she stands and smoothes her dress down as best she can.</p>
<p>“You were with him before, in the tent,” the woman says. “What are you &#8212; his girlfriend?” They stand close together in the doorway. The woman has the same pale gray eyes as her daughter, the same magnified effect. But her mouth, plump and pink, is less sneering, less hard.</p>
<p>“No,” Virginia says. “I’m his typist.”</p>
<p>“Whatever.” She flips her hair over her shoulder, more dignified, in her sheet, than Virginia fully dressed. “He’s just like the rest of them.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>The woman holds up her hand, palm out, fingers spread. “Because he can see it,” she says. “He thinks it’s there.” She steps through the doorway into the hall. “Move back,” she says, and then grips the door frame with one hand, and with the other, pulls the door shut on her fingers. It bounces back from the impact, and when she holds her fingers up for Virginia to see, a purple groove runs across the knuckles, and three of the nails have torn off.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with you?” Virginia says.</p>
<p>“Nothing,” says the woman. “It’s just, I’m starting to not exist.” Then she backs through the doorway into the room. “Now get the hell out,” she says and slams the door in Virginia’s face.</p>
<p>BACK ON SUNSET Lane, beneath the light of the Japanese lanterns strung overhead, Virginia pauses to brush herself off. The walking corpse was right: she looks ridiculous. A thirty-year-old woman, her knees dirty with floor grit, sawdust clinging to her sandals, stuck between her toes. Hair probably a mess, too, beginning to frizz. And worst of all, her mother’s dress is stained purple across the bodice. She spreads the skirt with her hands, tries to remember her mother in it. A young version of her mother, her dark hair pinned up, the yellow skirt of the dress swishing from side to side and her heels clacking as she walked &#8212; where? Toward Virginia, who was waiting for her. It’s not a real memory, not something she can pin down in time and place, but just an image &#8212; something she has conjured out of nothing, out of air and shadow and light.</p>
<p>Down the lane, she spots Cal. He’s just ahead, turning the corner onto Happy Hollow, and if she walks a little faster, she will catch him. She’ll catch him, and they’ll walk the rest of the way together. At some point, he’ll tell her his story, that he fucked a walking corpse. He’ll tell her he licked the air where her toes should’ve been, that he ran his hands over the holes in her arm, kissed the knobs of her fingerless knuckles. He’ll tell her he slept with a vanishing woman. A woman fading away, bit by bit, piece by piece. And unlike him, she will believe it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sound begins with a furnace<br />
clicking awake in a two-room house, answered<br />
by a few, then more, voices: gauges,</p>
<p>and old-fashioned watches ticking out of synch, in growing number,<br />
so their tip-tip-tip fattens to a moan, joined</p>
<p>by a horn’s upbeat honkity-honk, then ringtones and speakers<br />
rehearsing drawn horsehair, air in a woodwind, mimicking</p>
<p>a hand slapping a polyester drumhead, but unlike<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; these coarser frictions, playing the same, every time.<br />
A car door bangs, a jackhammer hammers, and a bassline</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; purrs through a wall. The sound congeals,<br />
sucking in more, a mechanical syrup in an IV drip, the automatic</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ruckus of a robotic ocean, a symphony<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;no one wrote, confounding every pattern:</p>
<p>teach me the song that no one can sing, someday<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to be the song of everything.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What I mean is I&#8217;m digging<br />
in the garden or just walking<br />
dully along, going on<br />
with my boggy life, when it<br />
snaps me up like a mouse,<br />
a snack for the hawk of grief<br />
and like a car antennae<br />
my tail whangs in the air.<br />
The wind harps my whiskers<br />
as too stunned to squeak, I&#8217;m sported<br />
farther and farther into edgelessness.</p>
<p>Scientists say gravity is good<br />
for making grass and trees stand up,<br />
suns jostle, bodies fall,<br />
but they can&#8217;t say what it is.<br />
Close and tight and sweet<br />
as mounded dirt, cover the length of me.<br />
It&#8217;s good to be held down</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The little house climbs from winter afraid<br />
of its own weakness.  The door, the cedar shakes.<br />
The knot of leaves in the porch corner drowses<br />
in the sunlight.  The frost sizzles and rises.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to find a word, a sentence, a handle<br />
for the color of the dead grass.  Gradually</p>
<p>in spasms of thaw, the grade of the continent<br />
takes the snow and other omens.  Squirrel nests<br />
hang like brains in the trees, rocking, rocking.<br />
Behind the house, daffodils.  Right and reckless.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Rendering-New-Selected-Poems/dp/0547249624"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-821" title="AmericanRendering" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/04/AmericanRendering-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300" srcset="https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/04/AmericanRendering-199x300.jpg 199w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/04/AmericanRendering.jpg 332w" sizes="(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px" /></a>What do we make these days of the term &#8220;Southern Gothic&#8221;? Has it only become a way to promote an author, as in the way the dust jacket of Andrew Hudgins&#8217;s new and selected poems, <em>American Rendering</em>, flaunts that Hudgins has &#8220;developed a distinctively descriptive form of the Southern Gothic imagination&#8221;? If so, we’ve come far in the 60 years since Tennessee Williams lamented that the term was “used as a major line of attack” by “critics, publishers, distributors, not to mention the reading public.” Or has “Southern gothic” come to refer to a notable form emerging from a distinctive regional literature?</p>
<p>Certainly, we have the familiar tropes of the Gothic in Hudgins&#8217; new poems: ghosts (&#8220;a creature formed of light / steps through the wall&#8221;), redemptive violence (&#8220;He bucked hard once, went limp, / and I spat his blood onto his un-tensed un-sentences&#8221;), manmade structures burning to the ground (“’He lay so near the burning house / his grease stewed out of him&#8221;), characters of questionable sanity (&#8220;Lorraine sang, Mouth or knife&#8221;) and speakers who elicit both sympathy and disgust (&#8220;I pulled carpet remnants over me, and that night / I married&#8221;). These poems also include the Southern themes that have been a hallmark of Hudgins&#8217;s poetry: race relations, childhood memories, rural landscapes, regional dialogue, small portraits of everyday life in the South and Biblical allusions and cadences. To be fair, these are also the themes that in the past have provoked critics to charge that Hudgins’s poems are too sentimental or crude.</p>
<p>But if we do have moments of sentimentality in these new poems—“the impossible possible once more and beauty, in perspective, / beautiful” or “For that minute, that moment, that / passage of time, I was / not childless, or a man”—they are few and far between and don’t overshadow moments of powerful authority, as when the speaker in the title poem describes how “a scorched theriaca / haloed the flames, the grease by which / we render America.” Indeed, Hudgins will approach sentimental subjects &#8212; a funeral, a wedding, a mother’s death, a friend’s suffering &#8212; only to downplay, or deny, their sentimentality by exposing, through uses of Gothic elements, their true horror and isolation.</p>
<p>But is simply combining “Gothic” and “Southern” elements the recipe for the “Southern Gothic”? If so, could we take a writer like Phil Levine, who also writes of barren landscapes, redemptive violence and characters who evoke both sympathy and disgust (only usually set against landscapes of the industrial Rust Belt) and call him an “Upper Midwestern Gothic” writer? Would the label stick?</p>
<p>These are rhetorical questions, of course, because the answer is more intuitive and requires the necessary element of the sublime. Lewis Simpson wrote that “the present-day southern gothic defines itself in examples as a vision of life that blends realism and grotesquery in a manner that we readily grasp as typical of the southern literary imagination,” and under such criteria, the answer is yes, Andrew Hudgins is indeed a writer of the Southern Gothic imagination, and a very fine one at that (by <a href="http://www.dresshead.com/dresshead-staff-profile-joann-whiteside" style="text-decoration: none;color: #333">whiteside</a> at <a href="http://www.dresshead.com" style="text-decoration: none;color: #333">http://www.dresshead.com</a>). Hudgins is also one of the few poets practicing this genre. And because poetry is (typically, and especially in the lyric mode) more concerned with investigations of consciousness than the narrator’s revealing of information, the poem can serve as a better forum for the kind of imaginative leaps that blend realism and grotesquery.</p>
<p>Hudgins remains one of the best contemporary poets at conflating the lyric and the dramatic, which is to say, he is skilled at making imaginative leaps. There are moments of remarkable, subliminal transformation in these new poems, as in &#8220;After Teaching,&#8221; when the speaker sees &#8220;inside the larger swelling of Benita&#8217;s swell, / an ancient old couple turn a corner in an ancient city.&#8221; Or in &#8220;The Bluebird, Singing, Leaps into the Sky,&#8221; when a bluebird, killed by a young boy on a hunt with his father and grandfather</p>
<blockquote><p>leaps into the sky<br />
and from the sumac, bewildered,<br />
running with outstretched bloodstained arms,<br />
eyes shy and nearly wild,<br />
there staggers toward them helplessly<br />
the blue unborning child.</p></blockquote>
<p>We might be satisfied with the good content here, but there are also fine formal poems in this sequence, including a villanelle (the haunting elegy “The Names of the Lost”) and a sequence of five ballads (or near-ballads with off-rhymes). But the near-perfect pacing of these poems is achieved more often than not through the play between a polysyllabic consonance and a beautiful, liquid assonance, as in &#8220;Mother&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>I followed my shadow to an appealingly dilapidated pond. Ghostly koi coasted under ripples undulating to the tempo of hidden pumps. Fish mouths mouthed my shadow</p></blockquote>
<p>These lines have a haunting sound, reminiscent of the language of the Southern Gothic, and coming from, of all people, a golf caddie. Indeed, Hudgins&#8217;s speakers are often the cast-aside, the homeless, the drunks &#8212; what Molly Boyd calls the Southern Gothic’s “inbred lower class living in extreme isolation in closed communities, which are plagued by economic impoverishment, educational ignorance, religious fundamentalism, racial intolerance, genetic deformities, perverted sexuality, and unrequited violence.&#8221; They are people, in other words, with whom a poet of democratic and Whitmanic principles can empathize.</p>
<p>In Hudgins’s earlier collection <em>Babylon in a Jar</em>, whose 38 poems are represented by only 16 in this selection, the speaker in the title poem drives by and longs to be like the drunks, asleep on side of the road (&#8220;I&#8217;d never done that, slept the night, / drunk, beside my car, so I envied and hated the drunks slumped in the crushed oyster shell&#8221;). And in &#8220;Mother,&#8221; the opening poem in <em>American Rendering</em>, Hudgins seems to write in the voice of one of those drifters:</p>
<blockquote><p>After midnight, I dragged carpet padding<br />
from a trash bin and spread it on the asphalt<br />
between the wall and dumpster. Screened from sleet,<br />
I pulled carpet remnants over me.<br />
<em><br />
Similarly, in “A Handful of Keys”:</em><br />
When I woke, a tailpipe thrummed inches from my face,<br />
and it inquired, Sir, are you hurt? Solicitous automobile,<br />
I thought till I saw my own owlish face regarding me from the black<br />
sunglasses of a state trooper who asked<br />
if I’d been drinking.</p></blockquote>
<p>Are these the same figures as those who appear in &#8220;The Choice the Driver Makes,&#8221; one of the best poems from Hudgins&#8217;s first book, <em>Saints and Strangers</em>? In that poem a 34-year-old Hudgins wrote from the voice of a roadside stranger who is &#8220;invisible / until the harsh lights choose[s] me out of night.&#8221; Flannery O’Connor once advised writers to “draw large and startling characters,” and although Hudgins’s peripheral characters may not always be large, it is their startling qualities that lead the reader to new, contemporary considerations of the Southern Gothic.</p>
<p>After all, the best of the post-Faulkner Southern writers, including O&#8217;Connor and Barry Hannah, tend to render the South, at times, absurdly. Hudgins has also adopted this strategy, though occasionally the absurdity can lend itself to an unwelcome obscurity, as in “Under the Horse,” or distracting implausibility, as in “Came Back.” But the new poems in <em>American Rendering</em> do not necessarily, as one critic has said of Hudgins, enjoy “the moral precisions of family life.&#8221; At their best, they balance and resolve the tension between desire and violence, between sex and death, between the imaginative and the real. And thus the structure of this book makes sense &#8212; we read through the new poems  in the collection first, then make our way up through Hudgins’s career, beginning with the first book, discovering a poet who returns to the same themes, obsessively perhaps, but with more daring and brilliance and less sentimental attachment each time. It is enough to affirm that Southern Gothic has become a distinctive art form and lay to rest Tennessee Williams’s lament; yes, the Southern Gothic is alive and well in the hands of Andrew Hudgins.</p>
<p>Hastings Hensel’s work has appeared <em>South Carolina Review</em>, <em>Hopkins Review</em> and <em>New South</em>.  He received his MFA from the Johns Hopkins Writing Seminars in 2009.</p>

<p>Nature as pillared temple – I’ll go along,<br />

<p>Yes to perfumes mellow as oboes – maybe malachite-blue? –<br />

<p>Crimson for Sousa’s brass and shine,<br />

<p>Consider a red-brick church in New Orleans<br />
that barely stands, flood line ten feet high.<br />
A boy with a cello cracked at the bridge<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I came home from work, I saw a package for him,<br />
so I took it up to the sixth floor where he lived.<br />
I was puffing a bit since I wasn’t used to the climb.<br />
I lived on the second floor of the same building<br />
with busted mailboxes and marble steps, worn thin<br />
towards the side nearer the banister from all those years<br />
of people ascending and descending—the immigrants first,<br />
then the working poor, and now drug addicts and artists.<br />
There was no doorman, and in place of our buzzer,<br />
just a few dangling red wires. The mailman dumped<br />
packages and magazines onto the floor<br />
of our phone booth-sized foyer. The second metal door<br />
had a square of mesh over the glass window<br />
because someone had smashed it in.<br />
Everything was painted a spooky gray,<br />
and the halls smelled like must and mold.<br />
Most of the blue and cream tiles<br />
that I imagined were once beautiful<br />
were broken or missing. The maintenance man<br />
my roommate called “a junkie with a hammer”<br />
had put some pink putty that looked like old bubblegum<br />
in places where the tile was completely gone.<br />
I was curious about the man who subscribed<br />
to <em>Art Forum</em> and <em>Spy</em> and <em>Time</em>, all of which<br />
I had been stepping over in the foyer.<br />
His fed ex box was heavy in my arms<br />
as I climbed those eroded warped stairs<br />
which were hard to negotiate, like walking<br />
on a beach, one foot in the water,<br />
the other on an incline in wet sand.<br />
There was an occasional crack vial on a landing<br />
that I’d kick into a corner. When he opened the door<br />
he was just like the neighborhood, tragic<br />
and ravished and exquisite. He was holding</p>
<p>his arm in a bunch of bloody paper towels.<br />
He’d just put his fist through a glass coffee table<br />
at his girlfriend’s place—she lived<br />
a few blocks north and west. They’d had a fight,<br />
and he was picking out translucent slivers<br />
from his arm. I wondered if he’d also smashed the glass<br />
on the metal security door. When I knocked,<br />
he probably thought I was the girlfriend,<br />
begging to take him back. I looked over his shoulder<br />
at the mattress on the floor, the tiny refrigerator<br />
like college kids have in dorms. As he told me<br />
his troubles, they seemed to drift into the past,<br />
and I knew that I’d be his next girlfriend.<br />
He was forty and I was twenty-eight, a little out of breath<br />
from the stairs, a little beyond grad school, but not much.<br />
A poet, I said. A painter, he said. I’ve lived here two years, I said.<br />
Eighteen years for me. He had the old kind of apartment<br />
that was not yet renovated, a toilet in the hall<br />
that he shared with two other bachelors on his floor.<br />
A filthy bowl that no one bothered to clean,<br />
a dusty light bulb with a chain, a defunct lock<br />
that looked as though, at one point, might have been<br />
accessed by a skeleton key. I went into his apartment<br />
and sat on his mattress, as there were no chairs<br />
or couch. He said, You want a drink? His walls were blank.<br />
I contemplated asking where all his paintings were,<br />
but instead I took the tweezers from his shaking hand<br />
and began to pull out the shards from his palm.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/Denise-AnUnmarriedWoman.mp3">An Unmarried Woman</a></p>
<p>(for Jill Clayburgh, 1944-2010)</p>
<p>When I first saw it, I was a high school junior. Jill Clayburgh was scandalous<br />
ballet dancing in her tee shirt and panties, showing her teenage daughter<br />
a wet spot on the bed after she’d made love to her husband, the girl’s father.</p>
<p>I was fascinated by Clayburgh’s lip gloss and feathered hair.<br />
I had a Fair Isle sweater just like hers and wanted the crazy cape<br />
in which she wraps her new lover on a cobblestone street in New York.</p>
<p>I didn’t understand then, of course, that I would someday be divorced<br />
after sixteen years of marriage, just like her character, throwing up<br />
on a sidewalk just like she did, jittery in a therapist’s office,</p>
<p>having an awful blind date, eating dim sum with a stranger<br />
who would try to kiss her in a cab. Instead of pirouetting<br />
to “Swan Lake,” I jumped around the apartment, singing</p>
<p>along with Pink and Beyoncé. Back then, in 1978, I didn’t quite get<br />
betrayal’s depths. I just liked Jill’s outfits—the skirt and tank in the final scene<br />
that reminds me now of Sarah Jessica Parker’s ensemble in the opening credits</p>
<p>of Sex and the City. When her artist-lover gives Jill a giant painting<br />
as he heads off to Vermont for the summer and she carries it through Soho,<br />
fumbling and twisting in the wind, you can’t help but root for her,</p>
<p>just as I am rooting for myself, watching this movie again on DVD<br />
thirty years later, part of my post-divorce Netflix recovery.<br />
Jill is in the obituaries (credit <a href="http://www.dresshead.com/dresshead-staff-profile-joann-whiteside" style="text-decoration: none;color: #333">joann</a> at <a href="http://www.dresshead.com" style="text-decoration: none;color: #333">here</a>). Breast cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia—</p>
<p>how can that be? She looks so young and fresh as she ice skates<br />
with her pals, runs along the East River where her husband steps in dog shit<br />
and blames her. When I first saw <em>An Unmarried Woman</em>, I went with my friend</p>
<p>and, if I remember correctly, we were freaked out by the sex scenes<br />
and barely acknowledged Jill’s bland teenage daughter<br />
who would have been about our age. Afterwards, at Friendly’s, we talked</p>
<p>about the pickled herring arc. Jill’s lover tells the story<br />
about how his mother threw a jar towards his father’s head<br />
and how, as he watched the fish smash against the wall, he decided</p>
<p>to become an abstract painter. Towards the end of the movie,<br />
the lover himself lobs a jar at Jill when she doesn’t do what he wants.<br />
My friend told me her mother hurled a bottle of applesauce at her father</p>
<p>and when she missed, the stuff ruined the wallpaper.<br />
That was just marriage, we guessed, sipping our frappes.<br />
We put our hands over our hearts and pledged we’d never wed</p>
<p>even as the cute boys came in, crowding into a booth<br />
across from us. We blushed and giggled despite ourselves.<br />
Adults, we agreed, were crazy—we wanted no part of their messes.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/Names-by-a-River.mp3">Names by a River</a></p>
<p>The keels of the Speedwell and Discoverer<br />
four hundred years ago passed over<br />
where I am walking among the glasswort<br />
and Hudsonia this morning, the river’s<br />
estuary here then. Before Bradford<br />
and Miles Standish you came<br />
with fifty men in armor out of Bristol,<br />
barely a man yourself, nevertheless<br />
Captain Martin Pring, from your portrait<br />
I’d say a handy little dude like Standish<br />
and John Smith, your chin-beard sharp<br />
as a poinado. Enough mitten-shaped leaves<br />
of the sassafras here to make a homeward cargo<br />
for both holds, you calculated &#8212; a possible cure<br />
for the French pox. A kingbird works<br />
the dune grasses for insects this morning,<br />
at what you named Whitson Bay after<br />
a prime investor in your voyage.</p>
<p>All that is left of 1603 has been shifted,<br />
wind and sea, ground down, sorted, re-pummeled,<br />
blown sideways, sea and wind, processed and<br />
overlain with grasses and snows among the vagaries<br />
of the river, itself renamed: Pamet now for the tribe<br />
you pressed into flight with the mastiffs<br />
Gallant and Fool. After a few thousand walks<br />
among the nesters here, I call these dunes<br />
and flats Egg Island, in part to confuse<br />
the local hiking club, identical in their<br />
baggy shorts and yellow T-shirts, their catalog<br />
explorer hats, outfits absurd as those you gifted<br />
the natives with, those “divers sorts of<br />
meanest merchandise.”</p>
<p>Who do I think I am, since only change<br />
is unchanging here: Whitson’s Bay<br />
to Egg Island, and your Mount Aldworth<br />
to Tom’s Hill, after a last Pamet<br />
who lived up there? Even the French pox<br />
has run through a litany of names,<br />
not many as impugning, but all as colorful,<br />
the Grandgore, the Black Lion,<br />
and the sassafras itself went into<br />
root beer. You stayed seven weeks, then sailed<br />
from the August heat inimical to northern blood.</p>
<p>Since mariners read the birds, though<br />
you wouldn’t have names for some, no doubt<br />
you saw the flocks dropping down<br />
and reforming for the south, semipalmated<br />
plovers this morning, big name for a brief<br />
flash of white with half-webbed feet,<br />
their migration begun, but you didn’t<br />
stay on for the grand transitions &#8212;<br />
a stray albatross, wing-broken, rolled over<br />
the dunes in a January blow, or the way<br />
a north wind surprises a walker as he faces<br />
about into it. Pilgrims, briefly, converting<br />
to whalers, then trap fishermen &#8212; would you<br />
have called them Portingales? &#8212;<br />
and the fish houses, ice houses, coal-fired freights,<br />
and the river forever trying new entries and<br />
departures between Corn Hill and Fisher’s Beach,<br />
scouring its bed into sandbars, undermining,<br />
making runs up the valley, trying to join<br />
the Atlantic at the farther shore.</p>
<p>And here, as I read the flats this morning,<br />
going side-by-side with a set of tracks, a dog<br />
at first, but no mastiff: feet too narrow,<br />
heel pads flat at the back, and no splay,<br />
so more likely a coyote, perhaps one of those<br />
you called “dogs with sharp and long noses.”<br />
The names never stick, as if in the naming<br />
the thing itself is changed. These whorls<br />
in the riverbed could be the fingerprint of God,<br />
and the slow motion whip-cracks of the river<br />
keep flexing over time between headlands.</p>
<p>SENTRY</p>
<p>Thistle, you look like another<br />
of evolution’s jokes, impossible<br />
as a great blue heron seems<br />
impossible, though you both<br />
are brilliant survivors.</p>
<p>Still, mixed metaphor,<br />
it looks like someone<br />
hung you all over with<br />
shaving brushes nobody<br />
soft-handed could wield,</p>
<p>then loaded one of those<br />
salad shooters they<br />
used to hawk on TV<br />
and fired green sickles<br />
and scimitars at you,</p>
<p>until, sentry at my door,<br />
you look like a gallowglass<br />
loyal to no one but your own<br />
stickle-backed containment.</p>
<p>I dubbed you Captain Barfoot,<br />
though I know from long<br />
acquaintance that a change<br />
of air will turn you to a mentor</p>
<p>white and silken, proof<br />
that the pilgrim in us all<br />
must cede his spines<br />
and hackers to endure.</p>
<p>STRIPED MAPLE HISTORY</p>
<p>The stump looked like a medical illustration<br />
of a heart, and its few wispy sprouts<br />
showed me it wanted to live, so I planted it<br />
by the door thirty years ago.</p>
<p>Each fall before the winds I still cut one side away<br />
from the windows and trim out several fine<br />
straight sticks sturdy enough for beanpoles.</p>
<p>So now, lopsided, a few branches looped and snaking,<br />
it is grandly disreputable, nothing of the nursery<br />
about it, and its three-lobed leaves, looking like<br />
goose prints, turn yellow as October cools so it seems</p>
<p>fall’s counterpoint to forsythia. Called goosefoot<br />
some places, here it is nicknamed whistlewood:<br />
a smart kid with a jackknife can reverse it to wood whistle.</p>
<p>Considered a pest of the understory by foresters,<br />
it can live to be a hundred. I have stood under it<br />
as a two-foot baby redtail hawk grappled through its twists,<br />
wings trapped open or akimbo, shaking down</p>
<p>flocks of propellering fruit upon a fleeing chipmunk<br />
and me. And all this spring a male yellowthroat<br />
&#8212; a warbler with a black mask like a cartoon<br />
housebreaker’s &#8212; has been jerking its tail</p>
<p>as furiously as a wren and knocking at its own<br />
reflection in the windows, defending its nest secreted<br />
somewhere in the maple, even while showing</p>
<p>without knowing it that we have to look into<br />
ourselves to look out for ourselves, and see<br />
through our dubious aspects.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>&#8220;Then a horrible thought came to me. I was dead, of course, and death was nothing but a continuation of life as it had been when one left it. . . . This is what purgatory was&#8211;or was it hell itself? My body was dead, but I was there too. I went into a stupor, hardly conscious. . . . At last &#8212; how long I don’t know &#8212; the knocking came again.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8211;Eugene O’Neill on his suicide attempt</p>
<p>Those days, he felt like a walking text, God-less, feigned,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a book not even the author understands, the self<br />
he thought he was only a linguistic hologram in a self-revising brain.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Most mornings, he spent writing drafts and throwing<br />
them away, trying to find a crescendo through his layers of disguise,</p>
<p>through the ticks and demarcations, the language like a dancer<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dancing the dance of seven veils around his head,<br />
a beautiful distraction, a swirl of feathers independent<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of a bird, no center, no storm-eye where<br />
that therapeutic emptiness might dwell, everything feeling artificial,</p>
<p>everything contrived, the forged prescriptions crumpled in his hand,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the sidewalks laid out like a crossword puzzle<br />
at his feet, as he walked the city with one ear tuned to the fatal shore,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; like Odysseus bound to the masthead, fearful<br />
yet restrained, his disgust towards his parents, towards the world,</p>
<p>slowly twisting inward, like the edge of something burned.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He gave a performance for each pharmacist,<br />
wincing, holding a hand against his side to fake a bit of pain,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the kind of thing his mother must have done when she had<br />
to have her morphine, each pharmacist sighing, turning obligingly away,</p>
<p>like the turn that signals a soliloquy, the self stripped bare before<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; an audience, like my body as they peeled my clothes away,<br />
the parchment-yellow skin, the disease scribbled everywhere,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the doctors reading, easily, the message in my swollen feet,<br />
in the sweat laced with my body’s waste, the compost heap</p>
<p>of my dirty clothes piled at their feet, the cut-off shorts, the underwear,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; each heartbeat being sucked into a stethoscope,<br />
an IV placed, the nurse with a fist around the plasma bag,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; trying to squeeze the platelets in, that boy leaving me<br />
while the blood of yet another stranger was pumped into my veins,</p>
<p>as if I were an actor switching roles, O’Neill drugged, passing out,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; vacant as a house behind a set design, the music<br />
moving through him, electricity and feathers, that vertigo, that swift<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; inward falling, his body like a word overgrown<br />
with implications, the small flame of its meaning trampled out,</p>
<p>a wince, a muscle-flutter, shock. All morning, I’ve been trying<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to make a song from the body’s gaps, its scars<br />
and biopsies, its errors, its transparencies, the breath<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; like something written and constantly erased,<br />
the flaw in me at birth no radar could detect, the slow erosion</p>
<p>of my kidney, the plankton of my leukocytes devouring the shore.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All morning, I’ve felt like a man running his fingers<br />
through the ash, sifting through his biographies, his plays,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the words, like blood cells filled with oxygen, briefly<br />
inflating as I read &#8212; his restless, untouchable silence,</p>
<p>that strange tethering of funeral and song behind his eyes &#8212;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; though the answers never really come, because<br />
the language like the body has no stasis point, can’t be solved,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; only organized, swept up into the jet stream<br />
of our thoughts, my own words jointed together in my sloppy</p>
<p>grade-school penmanship, balanced against each other, like a pile<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of twigs, or simplified into opposites &#8212; past/future, him/<br />
me &#8212; like those bars of light and shade hauled in through the window<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; blinds and laid across my chest this morning<br />
like a music staff, my body a box of piano strings, waiting to be struck,</p>
<p>the music fading now, the chair, O’Neill confused, thinking there’s<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; someone singing in the room, his body like a fog crawling<br />
through the windowsills, through the empty bottles on the floor,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so that as I remember, as I write, as I inhale him and speak<br />
him back into the air, he stirs, he hears me knocking at the door.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When they’ve seen the vision of their own bones<br />
corpsed with the creatures whorled into the stone,<br />
when they feel their bodies turning hieroglyphic</p>
<p>in the cave, each ax-stroke echoing, internally, their own<br />
decay, do trapped miners still fidget in the mountainside,<br />
or do they sit and listen to each other die? That’s</p>
<p>how I imagine it, tranced by the ventilator’s hydraulic drive,<br />
my father comatose, his mind like the quiet of the hospital<br />
at night, dim but still electrified, post-lingual and numb,</p>
<p>though that, too, must be imagined, everything beyond my grasp<br />
tonight, the nurses swanning silently in the halls, my mother asleep<br />
in some distant lounge, though she, too, seems to occupy only</p>
<p>the backyard syntax of my youth, her sadness as foreign to me<br />
as these other patients in these other rooms, one of whom I watched<br />
die last night, the room hung like a painting at the end of a dark</p>
<p>hallway, so bright it seemed I had projected it, her body &#8212; was it<br />
a girl? &#8212; small as a newborn calf curled in the sheets, the mother<br />
with her head pressed to her chest, as if what grief wants most</p>
<p>is to enter the bodies of those who’ve died. The grandparents<br />
stood at a tactful distance from the bed, two old somber farmers,<br />
holding hands, and me in the hallway like some helpless angel.</p>
<p>But no, more like &#8212; I’m ashamed of this &#8212; a man who’d<br />
wandered into the rehearsal for some play, their grief so far<br />
away, so vague, so unreal, that I understood how inadequate</p>
<p>my own gestures of sadness had become, my weeping, my<br />
siblings and I passing each other like shift workers in the halls,<br />
nothing sufficient, no way to put into words that black spot</p>
<p>in a mind that will not speak. Tonight, I’d like my father’s<br />
mind to expand and hold me in its vacancy, but the silence<br />
between us is just another argument, his body saying emptiness</p>
<p>and me turning to watch his numbers drifting downward on<br />
the screen. This morning, I watched as the room in which the girl<br />
had died was cleaned, the sheets bagged, the smell of ammonia</p>
<p>erasing her presence from the air. I wanted to be clean<br />
for my father’s loss, to build myself around him like a cave,<br />
but here, at the edge of death, thoughts freeze like water,</p>
<p>or so Descartes once wrote, in some other city, some other time,<br />
coughing himself into a mucous cup, the harbor frozen<br />
in the window at his bedside, that city he hated walking</p>
<p>itself through him as he died, he who knew that we die without<br />
one person, ever, having entered our minds, that the silence<br />
we are heading for is the one we’ve always occupied.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>I am God&#8217;s wheat, and I am to be ground by the teeth of wild beasts, so that I may become the pure bread of Christ<br />
&#8212; Ignatius of Antioch, Letter to the Romans</p></blockquote>
<p>On those nights when the moon was curled outside his window<br />
like a lion&#8217;s tooth, he’d ink and conceal the buried weather<br />
of his doubt, that deceiving angel ripping through him as his body</p>
<p>cantered and swayed against the sides of the boat, the cell contracting<br />
around him like a womb, as if to die was to be born adrift on dark<br />
and shoreless ether, the flesh telling him that flesh is all there is,</p>
<p>until there was no choice except to hate the body,  its desires<br />
and seals, rot and moldered lies, an ossuary of bones,  the body<br />
already dead, St. Paul said, because of sin, the soul a spit</p>
<p>of light passing through the wreckage of a ship, a glow-<br />
worm quickening the soil of us, these thinking graves, these plots<br />
we press up against each other, my wife convexed along my back</p>
<p>on those nights when our unborn daughter pulsed and swayed<br />
between us like a lamp or a fragile ark in which our chromosomes<br />
were packed, her body glowing because it wasn&#8217;t quite a body yet,</p>
<p>so that I&#8217;d see behind my eyes that translucent skin I&#8217;d seen<br />
in pictures, a mollusk swamped around its pearl at first, then the lava<br />
of creation expanding as it cooled, that rumpled cord linking her</p>
<p>not to her mother&#8217;s bloodstream, but to the other side of death,<br />
as if she were being poured into the womb, a self both tributarial<br />
and whole &#8212; larva, pupa, chrysalis, imago &#8212; that incantation mouthed</p>
<p>as prayer, though it didn&#8217;t help when she turned and the cord<br />
eeled around her neck, rupturing the monitor&#8217;s loose pentameter,<br />
so that until she turned again and slipped from the noose of elegy,</p>
<p>she was both alive and dead in me. Turn and counter-turn, flesh<br />
and rot of memory. No matter if the pearl, at first, is kissed<br />
into the womb, or if the shoreless angels flesh the glow, like tailors</p>
<p>gathered at our bones, these God-sphinxed chromosomes, fastened<br />
to the animal, inscribed with history, wear our bodies like a uniform,<br />
keep us swinging from incandescence to decay, the Saint</p>
<p>fathoms-deep in prayer and thrashed by the motions of the ship,<br />
his body like an anchor dragged forward by his faith, his vision<br />
of a violent purity billowing the sails, so that when he had to betray</p>
<p>either his body or his God, he wrote his executioners to entice the wild<br />
beasts, let them become his tomb, no matter if he recants himself<br />
or pleads, the flesh ruptured and caesarean, he sought, cleaved until</p>
<p>a soul begins to rise, my wife botanical and numbed upon the table,<br />
moaning for them to stop, her womb a vacancy, the smell of blood<br />
and disinfectant in the room, our daughter incised into the din &#8212;</p>
<p>a light broken from the emptiness, and the emptiness sewn in.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/What-Owed-Dead-R-Dillard/dp/0984069887/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1307121502&amp;sr=1-1"><img class="alignright" title="dillard_owed_the_dead" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/dillard_owed_the_dead.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>R.H.W. Dillard&#8217;s seventh collection of verse, <em>What Is Owed the Dead</em>, includes five poems that previously appeared in the pages of this magazine and manages to offer a unique breadth and depth of literary scope, primarily through its focus on a wide array of dead writers, celebrated and neglected, and its clever use of literary embeddings: passages drawn from the work of the deceased writers it addresses as well as that of those it does not.</p>
<p>Fifty-two poems make up this fifty-three- page collection, each of them sixteen lines long, but that is where uniform matters of form end for the most part. Diction, rhythm, and other conventions sometimes mirror those of the given writer at hand, but are frequently interrupted – sometimes jarringly – by a quotation from a writer (not necessarily the one to whom a poem is addressed) or an excerpt from Dillard&#8217;s writing journals, which span back to the 1950s. It is the former of these intrusions or &#8220;embeddings,&#8221; which lends the collection much, though certainly not all, of its resonance and power.</p>
<p>One of Dillard’s acknowledged literary masters, Nabokov, often performed the technique of embedding as a kind of game which also deepened meaning (the title of his book <em>Pale Fire</em>, for instance, draws upon passages from Shakespeare’s<em> Timon of Athens </em>and <em>Hamlet</em>). At their most dramatic and outrageous, embeddings may grow to become entire rewritings of celebrated literary texts, as seen in the work of Kathy Acker (a writer Dillard admires and author of radical rewritings of Cervantes, Dickens, Proust, and many others). In this way, a certain literary history or revisionist history is conveyed even as the writing simultaneously goes about generating other effects.</p>
<p>The embedding employed in What is Owed the Dead is rarely fluid or subtle. Rather, it readily announces its presence and identity by placing passages from writers in quotation marks and assigning them footnotes, which many readers likely will simply ignore in favor of skipping on to the next poem. Some of the best poems in the collection – &#8220;Raven&#8221; and &#8220;Fame,&#8221; for example – limit their embeddings either to a couple of passages by one or two different writers, or several by the same writer. In &#8220;Raven,&#8221; for instance, Poe and Nabokov are the only quoted writers, which makes the poem spare and austere, as opposed to many of the multiple-writer, quotation-laden poems that follow it:</p>
<blockquote><p>All those lies, caw caw cacophony,<br />
Smear the air like mustered crows,<br />
Is that what it all amounts to, crowbait,<br />
Glassy eyes, those “windows to the soul” . . . .</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Fame,&#8221; on the other hand, employs numerous quotes from six poems and two letters by Emily Dickinson. Yet any potential confusion in employing so many passages is largely dispelled by the fact that they all come from the same writer:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bolted door, not even “approbation of my dog,<br />
”Then “he kindly stopped” death, lonely “little<br />
Cottage,” fame,1,775 poems, glory, “called back.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The samplings in these lines arrive from four different sources, yet remain coherent and interwoven largely by virtue of the fact that Dickinson is their common creator.</p>
<p>There does not appear to exist any particular pattern to the dead writers Dillard has chosen to address: the book begins with Poe, Pound and Laurence Sterne and concludes with San Juan de la Cruz, Richard Wright and George Barker. It is Barker, whom Dillard identifies in the book&#8217;s credits as &#8220;the guiding spirit of this entire enterprise,&#8221; who provides the only piece in the book not written mostly by Dillard: the epilogue from his 1950 book, <em>The Dead Seagull</em>, which maintains, &#8220;[W]e, the living, are . . . indebted to our predecessors for some small mercies.&#8221; Bookending this epilogue is a short epigraph from Geoffrey Hill&#8217;s <em>The Triumph of Love</em> on the title page of Dillard&#8217;s book: &#8220;a daily acknowledgement/of what is owed the dead.&#8221; These framing passages from Barker and Hill offer one key (there are others) to reading the poems which lie between. They may be recognized as memorials stemming from indebtedness but which also have the capacity to aid us, as demonstrated by Dillard’s journal entries, in our present states of confusion, depression, and ambiguity.</p>
<p>This conceptual approach should not lead one to the conclusion that Dillard&#8217;s book is without humor. To the contrary, the easy familiarity with which he addresses some of the collection&#8217;s more canonical poets both humanizes them and offers a degree of levity at which their sycophantic followers very well may take offense. &#8220;You wanted it, Emily,&#8221; begins the poem to Dickinson, &#8220;glory, fame.&#8221; He goes on to address Pound as &#8220;Ez,&#8221; T.S. Eliot as &#8220;Tom,&#8221; Yeats as &#8220;Willie,&#8221; and so on. Yet these are instances of playfulness rather than disrespect, and help to rescue a book investigating such dark subject matter from lapsing into macabre plodding. Indeed, as one reads on it becomes clear the volume is as much a celebration of the active creative life of the present as it is a memorial to past lives and works.</p>
<p>An anecdote may serve as a fitting conclusion. A literary mentor once recounted to me that one evening while introducing George Garrett – the writer to whom Dillard’s collection is dedicated – Dillard remarked that Garrett surely was one of the best writers living, and “better than a lot of the dead ones too.” Among other things, this collection shows Dillard the poet as capable of holding his own among many of the departed versifiers to whom he and many others are indebted. We are both in good company and in good hands in the pages of <em>What is Owed the Dead</em>.</p>
<p>Rosalina Leticia&#8217;s reviews have appeared in the <em>James Dickey Review</em> as well as a number of Brazilian publications. She lives and writes in Espirito Santo, Brazil.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>And tomorrow there may be tiny eggs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bought from the farmer: yellow and gray and blue<br />
and his cheese, a small miracle dispatched<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from goats. There may be a llama taking<br />
grass between his teeth, whose chewing into jade saliva<br />
is like old poetry’s heartbreak, ancient couplets<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;riding the furred neck, a sound at once remote<br />
and inside the skin.</p>
<p>Tomorrow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it may be different, the water I was formed in<br />
will be old-fashioned, my family knocked from their seahorses,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from their dusky corners by my wedding,<br />
a day I’m certain of nothing and all things at once. My own<br />
future children layered in mute dust, an idea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;surfacing hotly then growing hidden again<br />
like the dog’s wet tongue.</p>
<p>Yesterday<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went to Angola’s prison rodeo and everywhere<br />
a sadness broke through. It was in the eyes of all animals, scared<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and tough and irrelevant. It was in the arms<br />
of the little girl, who raced her horse around a barrel before<br />
losing her hat and falling from her saddle after it, gravity<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a hoof-mooned, dirty wonder.<br />
Outside the ring ambulances hummed.</p>
<p>And beyond that,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the dusty lanes, well-behaved prisoners sold<br />
rocking chairs and belts. For five bucks one took our photo<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a mock cell with toilet and bed. I was there<br />
with my bridesmaid. We did our best to look condemned<br />
in striped shirts, the same as the prisoners.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The photographer was so polite, she and I joked about<br />
a double wedding. </p>
<p>Or another inmate holding Fat Girl, a black lab<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like my own. And on the way home, a dozen miles<br />
of bayou, we stopped at a bar where a former guard sold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;machine-spun daiquiris. She talked about her boyfriend<br />
somewhere back in Angola. And somewhere else, </p>
<p>I see headlines of priests and sexual trespass, a word<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that finds me as a child studying The Lord’s Prayer<br />
for confirmation.</p>
<p>And all this floats up like a pair of hands in supplication,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or a song broadcasting from Vatican Radio some new hit,<br />
and it’s me singing for all those children, and it’s god<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with a bouquet of baby’s breath, sadness momentarily put on hold.<br />
Tongues roll back into the mouth’s unlocked cell, and I think of<br />
the faithful and the chosen. How tomorrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be married.</p>
<p>And sometime after, I will think again of Fat Girl learning<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to roll over. I will think of the poor grade<br />
I made in geometry, all the future’s difficult math,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the secrets that we carry and accrue, the fingers<br />
of my children, fractions of time ever halving<br />
as it does in tri-fold mirrors for which we pay, the grace of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;miniature pardons, of men in flight for a moment<br />
as their horses leave them behind. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The child’s cry is a light that comes on in the house,<br />
when the street is empty and the trees are still.<br />
The light in the window gives voice to the cry,</p>
<p>so when the windows are closed, we still know<br />
her voice is pushing against the walls of her room.<br />
Her cry: a light that comes on in the house,</p>
<p>quivering the filaments in the bulbs, lifting<br />
her parents out of their beds in the dark; at times<br />
a neighbor’s light will echo the cry. Her voice</p>
<p>arriving from what seems to be nowhere—<br />
from inside such a tiny body, it comes on<br />
and on, that cry somehow filling the whole house</p>
<p>when her parents are sleeping, when the world<br />
is sleeping. Like a lighthouse beam it swings around<br />
and out of her body, flooding the window, a cry</p>
<p>emerging from inside a dream, a need or fear<br />
she can’t yet utter; all there is is her breath<br />
pushing the cry, the light coming on in the house—<br />
and her voice: a light planted deep in the cry.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the night Will felt the floating sensation, he attended a performance of the Ugandan Boys Choir. The boys were trash scavengers, rescued by a Good Samaritan and taught to harmonize, who performed every night across California to raise donations and recruit volunteers for the Kampala orphanage. Will attended by himself, since Regina was at the baby shower for a college friend’s third child. This was the friend who’d called Regina, offhandedly and without malice, a ringless fiancée, by which she meant a woman certain to marry but lacking the diamond. Regina had grieved over the term for weeks.</p>
<p>The Ugandan Boys sang in the church for two hours. Terraced upon metallic risers, they elongated their jaws. On one song, the boys left the stage to pass donation baskets, and the volume and balance fluidly shifted as the voices swung close and away. The music seized Will. It offered odd time signatures, syncopated rhythms, contrapuntal notes. Despite his usual formality inside sacred walls, he found himself tapping his foot and nodding in tempo. Instead of his normal instinct to pin down feelings with philosophical thoughts, he wanted to run through fields and not grow weary. He wanted to swim and not grow tired. He wanted this soundtrack to animate his life.</p>
<p>Will closed his eyes. The melodies became flags, waving in tempo. The notes danced and died and regenerated. Then his chair seemed to exhale him, and the floor released his feet. The pressure on his buttocks eased. He hovered, feeling weightless as a bubble. His skin felt permeable, with no membrane between air and flesh. The sensation continued until the precise moment when—as if synchronized—the last note terminated. Then his body settled, tethered again. Applause erupted around him. He gripped the chair, breath drumming in his ears. He felt like he’d been attacked. He turned to the woman behind him and asked her if she saw it. “Yes, they’re great,” the woman said, nodding towards the choir, still clapping. Everyone stood in an ovation. No one paid him any attention. As the audience flooded the front to talk to the boys, he fled through the double doors, feeling pursued.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>He told Regina the following day, when they were on the couch with her dead aunt’s quilt. Though he preferred to rest in her room, Regina judged privacy a stumbling block to purity. He read. She knitted. Her long hair kept interfering with her needles. It’d grown past her waist, requiring the choke points of several bands. He often found Rapunzel-length strands in his car.</p>
<p>“Six months?” she said. “Uganda?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say I was going,” he said. “They just offered the opportunity.” He would miss her too much to go. Last summer, when he’d flown to a weeklong car convention in Denver, he called her twice a day. And there was no question of her accompanying him—their families would raise an outcry if they traveled together unmarried. They hadn’t even kissed. Influenced by the popular books in home-school circles, she’d made a promise—she didn’t swear, she refused to swear—not to kiss anyone but her husband. He respected her belief because he knew it would hurt her deeply to break that promise.</p>
<p>She’d stopped clicking her needles, a sound so metronomic he found himself adjusting his breath to match its pace. “Getting married is an adventure, too,” she said.</p>
<p>“And I want that,” he said. After all, he’d filled his quotient of adventure on two mission trips in his college years, to Indonesia and Samoa. She was living her adventure now, swarmed by toddlers at the day care. Once he’d surprised her at work with flowers, and discovered her bracing bottle-sucking girls off both hips, while using a knee to push a boy on the swing who screamed, “Higher! Higher!” She was beaming.</p>
<p>“You do this,” she said. “Remember dog breeding in Kentucky? Remember that Iranian underground-church plan?”</p>
<p>“You’re right,” he said. “It was silly to even bring it up.”</p>
<p>“It was,” she said.</p>
<p>When he first met Regina, at a brother- and sister-wing bowling night, she’d rolled a strike and curtsied. He’d stored that clip in his head, replaying it often. It was such a graceful act—the pinch of dress between index and thumb, the right foot bent behind, the chin dipped. She seemed a quaint maid transplanted from a bygone time. A month passed before he’d started courting her. She preferred that term to dating.</p>
<p>She used her thumb to rotate her purity ring. “Do you love me more than anything?”</p>
<p>“No,” he said.</p>
<p>Her head jerked. “Well, not more than God, of course,” she added hastily.</p>
<p>“Right,” he said. But he knew what she needed and gave it to her: he said that he loved her, that there was no one else, that she was beautiful.</p>
<p>She kneeled and lowered her head to the coffee table, so all he could see was the part in her blonde hair that exposed a vulnerable line of her scalp. He said her first name: once loudly, once quietly. He said her full name—Regina Sarah Olsen—but not even that unlocked her. Finally, she lifted her head. “If you really wanted to go, you could go,” she said. The words rang hollow.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t really considering it.”</p>
<p>“Well,” she said. “I just wouldn’t want to hold you back.” It sounded straight from a cue card. Still, the possibility resonated in his chest, as if all his organs were tuned to the pitch of her permission.</p>

<p>She offered gifts. Usually she didn’t gift him except on birthdays and Christmas, but now she sprung them at random. At her apartment one night, he found her in an apron dusted with flour, both hands behind her back. She whipped out a gift-wrapped object, and he unwrapped it to find a book about the Icelandic chess match between Bobby Fisher and Boris Spassky during the Cold War. He hugged thanks. Afterwards, she fed him hot scones, tipping her fingers up at the end to help him eat each bite. He made Neanderthal chomping sounds and she squealed when he pretended to bite her fingers. When he said he didn’t want more, she insisted. She made engine noises and flew flight patterns until he relented.</p>
<p>One night, after working until nine, he found a pastel envelope fluttering under the gums of his windshield wipers. A card bearing her florid handwriting, the large cursive loops on the ‘l’s and ‘f’s, which, according to a manual on handwriting psychology he’d read, indicated a generous ego. In the card she flung a largesse of compliments, not the cheap trinkets that any stranger could trot out, but the genuine coin. It was one of her best traits, this way she had of loving him. He read it twice.</p>
<p>He drove to the bookstore with the intention of buying her a book. During a recent facelift, the store had shuffled their sections and he couldn’t find the cookbooks. Instead, he found himself on a long aisle with neon-colored spines. Just as he reached the end, a book cart wheeled up, blockading him. He backtracked, noticing the spines belonged to travel guides. He didn’t want to linger, but glanced over the titles. At eye level, out of alphabetical order, were three yellow Ugandan guidebooks. Why three? He would have guessed the store only carried the regional book. He leafed through, feeling guilty. Reading the introductory notes, he realized he knew nothing of Uganda—their language, their currency, their politics. All his knowledge came from the tired Western views of the continent, as if Africa were a homogenous blotch on the globe. He bought the guidebook, just to look at the pictures. Nothing more. Afterwards, he realized he’d forgotten to buy the cookbook, and when he met Regina and friends for board game night, he only said that he’d been browsing.</p>

<p>Will and Regina attended a wedding in a spacious backyard. Regina and the bride had homeschooled together for years, and Regina relayed to him multiple times the story of the bride and groom meeting, betrothing and marrying within eight months. Paper lanterns swung from strings, apple cider filled the flutes, an aging Christian singer crooned from the stereo. Regina was not unhappy. Although there was no formal dancing, she swung the tuxedoed arms of her five-year-old brother. Will sat at the pink-creped table and watched the dignity of the bride and pent-up anticipation of the groom, the children chasing one another with party favors clutched in chubby hands. He knew these people. These were his people. They would keep attending church, keep elevating God, keep their marriage vows, keep raising their children in the ways they should go. Tragedies would be chalked up to the divine plan, and suffering embraced as a purifying force. Nothing truly unpredictable would happen: Butler would gain weight, Alison’s grandparents would tour the country in their motor home, the twins would win tennis tournaments. He could see five years, ten years, and knew that nothing would rupture their course. This, this. He wanted only this. With this he could be happy.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>“I have something to confess,” Will told her one sunny day, while they were at bat against a Valencia church. This wasn’t the place, he could feel how wrong it was. Sports warped the delicate bonds between males and females. A foul ball soared, outfielders bobbing heads to spot it and avoid their teammates. She didn’t wait for the pop fly resolution, just turned to him. She looked good in the loose jeans, dusted red from the last inning. Usually he only saw her in dresses. “I emailed the orphanage,” he said. The phrase resounded in the space between them. He felt like he’d hit her.</p>
<p>“That’s nice,” she said, turning away. Then she gripped the dugout railing and yelled at the new batter: “C’mon Lacey! Sock it!” He leaned back and waited for her to process and turn, angrily, but she didn’t. Normally, she let him make the hefty decisions, like whether to drive together to her Uncle’s house in San Francisco. She would act as though she didn’t care, although sometimes she did. Now, even though she couldn’t tell a shortstop from a catcher, she kept her focus on the game. The bark of the bat, the soar of the ball into the low sky, the outfielders scrambling to bottom it. She cheered and pumped a fist.</p>
<p>But in a way, he was relieved that she hadn’t pressed him. If she had, he would have admitted he didn’t want to email the orphanage. That he didn’t want to go at all. It was an email in a moment of thoughtlessness, about which he felt shameful, as if he’d gone to the wrong website and seen something he shouldn’t.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>In the shed at his parent’s house, his father soldered a scepter onto a queen. On the shelf, bishops apexed in a bulb and knights brandished swords from winged horses. The blade of the TIG torch seared his vision. His father swung off his hood and asked, “Ready to get whooped?”</p>
<p>They sat on either side of the upended wooden spool. This set was cast in geometric shapes: blocks for pawns, stacked balls for queens, triangles for bishops. His father got two glasses of lemonade, even though Will knew they’d forget to drink it, and secreted a black and white pawn in each fist. Will picked the right fist. White. Just before he moved, his father asked, “Now what’s this about Uganda?”</p>
<p>Up to that moment, Will had been deluded enough to believe that Regina hadn’t truly heard or didn’t care. But she must have deliberately dropped a comment, probably to his mother, which cascaded to his father. His parents wanted a quiver of grandchildren. The delay of several years seemed fruitless. And Regina knew they thought this way.</p>
<p>Will told him about the choir, trying to explain it offhandedly.</p>
<p>“Why would you want to go?” his father said.</p>
<p>“I don’t even know,” Will said. “I probably don’t want to.”</p>
<p>“I know why,” his father said. “You have a good heart and want to help people.”</p>
<p>It sounded like a solid reason, and Will let his father think it was the correct one. His father lived that way, helping people through the part-time work at the church and janitorial work for school, working despite the migraines. It was always about others. His father replied to the opening with the Budapest Gambit and slapped the clock vigorously. He’d played on the circuit with his junior college team but now spent most of his chess time building custom sets. Obscene requests were denied, but he’d built sets of New York/Los Angeles architecture and Roman emperors holding coins bearing their image.</p>
<p>“So did they get back to you?” his father asked.</p>
<p>“The orphanage? Yes. They gave details.” The details were draconian. Four volunteers slept in one small room. Food was austere. It was less of an enticement and more of a warning.</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t go,” his father said. “You’ve got too much to lose.”</p>
<p>His father traded a bishop for two of Will’s pawns and pushed his queenside. Will tried to blockade with a knight. Flies landed on the pieces and Will shooed them away. When Will was five, his mother found him sleeping in a laundry basket with a chessboard and pieces, and his father joked that he’d started playing in the womb. The day after his grandfather died, Will played a marathon session, and after he and Regina fought, he often retreated to an online site for blitz games.</p>
<p>His father advanced a pawn. “She can’t wait forever,” he said.</p>
<p>“I know,” Will said.</p>
<p>His father once built a religious chess set. Christ, Gabriel, disciples versus Satan, demons, possessed. When he told people about it, he asked them to guess which side was white. Then he’d laugh loudly. For some years he showcased the set on his website, but sold it because he didn’t like the possibility of black winning. Will liked the set concept—it implied that even the powers and principalities played by reason. And his father agreed, proposing that parishioners should play chess before church services, to usher them into God’s mode of thinking.</p>
<p>His father studied the board, elbows on the table. Will didn’t think he saw it. The next move Will would sacrifice a bishop. Once he sacrificed the bishop, the rest of the game would be inevitable. His father moved and Will replied. The move made his father inhale. There would be a smothered mate on h8 in seven moves. Every variation was accounted for, every sequence anticipated. The pure inevitability was beautiful. But when his father swung his hands out in frustration, he knocked over a glass of lemonade. It shattered on the concrete and Will felt a shiver against his pinky toe. Blood dewed from a cut. By the time they cleaned up the glass and sanitized the wound, his mother arrived home with groceries, and after they unpacked them, Will had to meet Regina. The game was lost. His father joked that he should injure opponents more often. “Like in chessboxing,” he said. He ducked his head and pretended to jab twice.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>Will was five years old, on his back. Bees hummed around his head. Oak branches sliced up the sky. Someone had yelled something he hadn’t understood. Black clouds formed and dissipated across his vision, and inside these clouds, blurred shapes of men and animals moved, as if seen through a dark glass. When the clouds stopped, the sky kaleidoscoped through the rainbow’s spectrum. He tasted colors. Burnt, smoky copper. Floral breezy gold. Then it all settled and the world righted itself. He started crying. Scruffy approached and licked his face. There was the bang of the screen door; there was the rapid flap of his mother’s sandals. She knelt and cupped his head and plied him with questions, and he could only remember playing with his truck, followed by the loud voice and the clouds and the colors. “What loud voice?” she asked. He said his head hurt. He wasn’t bleeding. He bore no marks.</p>
<p>One doctor diagnosed it as a strange type of stroke, and prescribed medication. Another doctor argued his body bore the signs of an electrical shock, a magnitude on par with lightening. His mother insisted there were no outlets or extension cords in the backyard and no clouds in the sky. Another doctor said nothing had happened, that his brain needed to discharge energy and he’d experienced powerful yet illusory sensations. They gave up going to doctors. Their degree of certainty directly correlated to their degree of inaccuracy. A few admitted their inability to pin down a reasonable answer, and told his mother to watch for a recurrence so more data could be gathered. But it hadn’t happened again, not like that, not for years.</p>
<p>In an early draft of his application for the philosophy program at The Lord’s College, Will told that story. It seemed a seminal moment, even though he’d never been able to assign it a precise role. Instinctively, he knew it explained why he wanted to study analytic philosophy, but couldn’t tell how. In a vague way he believed that philosophy could ward off events like that one, but since philosophers had to be able to clearly draw from point A to point B, he eventually cut it, substituting an essay on how he inherited the ideals of chess from his father.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>She kissed him. It was never meant to be that order of subject and object. He kissed her: that was how he’d always envisioned it. That order, he thought, was the only way that she would ever have wanted it. Allow the man to be the leader. After all, when they first started spending time together, she wouldn’t call him, insisting he should call her. But here she’d seized initiative.</p>
<p>They’d guided the junior high youth group to Magic Mountain and ridden the newest coaster. During the corkscrew at the end, his vision dimmed, as though someone twisted a knob for the lights. All the light funneled into the center then faded to black, and even the passengers’ screams decrescendoed. In that tunnel without exit he felt the terrifying sensation of losing control, and then the corkscrew straightened out to pull up to the platform and light and sound ebbed back.</p>
<p>They sat on a bench semi-blocked by bushes and she asked whether he was okay. He lied and said yes, forcing a smile. The smile triggered her.</p>
<p>He didn’t know how they’d dated for three years and never kissed. No, he knew. Her hirsute father who required an interview before granting permission to date his daughter. The group dates for the first six months, followed by chaperoned ones. Her mother telling the story of how the only person she’d ever kissed was Regina’s father. Regina’s reluctance to hold hands until a year had passed, and of course her promise to keep her lips virginal. Add to that his fear of himself, of losing control. Of believing passion in their marriage would be lost if he prematurely opened the gate of pleasure.</p>
<p>They spent a half hour on the bench, primly exploring each other’s lips. He’d expected to feel untamed. He’d always feared the urges of his loins. But the sensation gave him an odd detachment, a pleasurable distance from which he analyzed the situation. There were two people on a bench. They were kissing. It was a scene he’d watched thousands of times and even this time he remained more a viewer than a participant. She giggled. She fingered her long braid curled in her lap. He ignored the passersby, then glanced at them with embarrassment. A man carrying a cluster of balloons stopped across the way. As he detached a purple balloon for a girl, a red one wriggled loose and soared, weaving in its ascent.</p>
<p>Her line at the end disappointed him. He would have preferred a romantic mood, unleavened by laughter, but instead, as they moved to find the junior highers, she teased him: “Wouldn’t you miss that?” Motives curdled the moment. Instead of the supernova of a long-awaited pleasure, it seemed calculated. He suspected why she said it: earlier in the day, a mob of black children passed by, corralled by two black ladies who alternated between gaiety and reprimands, and he turned to look at the children, feeling nostalgic about an experience he had not yet had. She saw him look and he saw her interpret.</p>
<p>He meant to only peck her when he dropped her off at her apartment, but couldn’t resist lingering. On the drive home, he admitted that despite his aversion to her method, it certainly worked: he would miss that, if he were crazy enough to leave. He would miss it terribly.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>At that backyard wedding they’d attended, Will had heard Regina’s Uncle Roy tell a story about a distant British relative of the Olsen clan. The man had left his wife one day, just walked out the front door and did not come back. Apparently, he moved just a few blocks over and changed his job. He spied on her but never contacted her. There was no mistress. It was a loving marriage. Eventually his wife counted him among the dead. They held a funeral. He spied on the funeral. Once he walked past his wife on the street and his wife did not recognize him. A few months after the funeral, he returned to his own house during the night and settled into bed. In the early morning hours, his wife woke and found a strange man occupying her bed. Nothing about him made her think he might have been her former husband. So she seized a letter opener and stabbed him. When he cried out, she recognized his voice. She called an ambulance and paramedics saved him.</p>
<p>That was where the story ended. The circle broke up to attend to misbehaving children. But Will asked Uncle Roy what happened. Uncle Roy said the couple had gone to therapy, not that it helped. The man was impenetrable. He didn’t fight the therapist, he just had nothing inside him that the therapist found helpful. The man didn’t know why he had left or why he had come back. He seemed as confused about it as everyone else, except that he knew he’d needed to leave. His wife had gone to see the brownstone where her husband had lived, but someone else had already rented it. Apparently, he’d thrown everything in a dumpster. A clean break. He wanted to pick up life where they’d left off. The story happened twenty years ago, and from that time he’d been a devoted husband.</p>
<p>The next day Will told Regina he hated the story. It made him feel sick.</p>
<p>“Oh, that story’s not true,” Regina said. “Uncle Roy embellishes all the time.”</p>
<p>Will countered that her father and aunts had not questioned the story, but Regina insisted it was made-up. Her head wagged no, as if swinging along a deep groove. Suddenly he knew that whatever its truthfulness, she couldn’t accept it. He realized: even if she were the wife of that man, she wouldn’t believe the story.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>That night insomnia haunted him, despite his usual trick of squeezing the pressure point between thumb and index. He rose and sat at the dining table. His roommate’s snores bored through the door. The cabinets and furniture took on new contours, reshaped by generous shadows and stingy light. He started a list. Lists organized the world, offering neat parameters and channels. On one side, Negative: Career, parents, money, physical love, and above all, Regina. His pen lingered over the Positive side without committing to the page. Finally, in a bid to put a word down, he wrote, “Called?” Then he jammed the list in the trash beneath the chicken carcass and returned to his bed where he lay, sleepless, watching moonlight drift across the floor from the fulcrum of the blinds. He worried about experiencing one of his moments, but felt nothing.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>He and Regina walked near his apartment, following a meandering path through the tree-canopied canyon. It was on the outskirts of the city, full of low ranch houses splayed out on multiple-acre plots. The imprints of horse hooves were fossilized in the ground. Even though it was January, an autumnal palette of leaves clung to the trees.</p>
<p>They talked of teaching a Sunday school lesson about Abraham and Isaac and of visiting Santa Barbara with her parents and seven siblings. They talked of the new program that automatically censored foul language from movies. He had the feeling she was avoiding any mention of Uganda, so he hinted at the topic by saying that his boss promised a chance at promotion if he didn’t hightail it to a foreign country.</p>
<p>She shrank into herself, as though storing up energy before a launch. “I think I know why you feel compelled to go,” she said. She threw her shoulders back the way she did before every spiel. Then she launched into his record of service in college: missionary, soup-server, poverty minister, worship leader, camp counselor. A poster child of self-sacrifice. “And what do you do now?” she said. “Now you rent cars. Now you make money. Now you focus only on yourself and me. It’s no wonder that you feel like you need to give a little again.” She seemed satisfied by this explanation, as if hoping the sense of it would overcome his urges.</p>
<p>The logic was inescapable. She’d put words to something he’d once imagined: himself in that Greek myth where the protagonist stares at his reflection until he dies. Except in his case, there wasn’t one reflection but hundreds. Hundreds of mirrors surrounding him, all showing himself to himself, and it was horrifying. But that vision came only in a moments of doubt. He had created ways to give of himself, to her and to his community, even though not at the same rate. Of course he wanted to give more, but that wouldn’t justify a continental leap. “That’s not bad,” he admitted. “But I think it’s beyond that.”</p>
<p>“Beyond it to what?”</p>
<p>Will thought of a man playing a flute through the streets, and those that streamed out to follow him. He thought of images flashed so quickly that the naked eye couldn’t detect them. He thought of the trigger words used by hypnotists to set their subjects in motion. “To listening?” he said.</p>
<p>They walked on. He noted every item in their path, as if later he could revisit the order and quilt a patchwork of meaning. Hull of a snail, a fake mustache, an atlas page. He didn’t know how the conversation turned dark. Her tears arrived without warning. She began complaining that he was keeping her emotionally hostage. “Make a decision,” she said. “Tell me you won’t leave me.”</p>
<p>“Every day I make the decision to stay,” he said.</p>
<p>“That means any day you could go.”</p>
<p>He pictured himself walking out of her apartment and never going back. The idea scared him more than any nightmare. He doubted he had that willpower. He didn’t want that willpower. Her eyes scanned his face, reading the lines of his cheeks, his mouth, the ridge between eyebrows. She must have disliked what she saw.</p>
<p>“I didn’t want to show you this but I will,” she said.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>They drove back to her apartment and she set up the laptop. A video clip with yesterday’s date. The BBC’s accents dignified even the most tragic events. It showed men in tattered jerseys waving rifles from the back of trucks. The ticker tape read “January Massacre.” The voiceover related the political troubles in Kenya, and the map flashed the long border with Uganda. Key phrases surfaced: fleeing refugees, destabilized government, dominoeing violence. The images veered from skinny men in oversized T-shirts shooting weapons to clusters of men pumping fists in the air. The segment ended on a shot of a muddy pond, with lumpy bags stacked on the shore. Then he realized. Those were not bags. Those were not bags.</p>
<p>“You hadn’t heard,” she said.</p>
<p>He imagined bullets strafing over his head or militants holding him ransom. During college, his friend’s mission trip to India had been cancelled because of a nuclear standoff between India and Pakistan, and everyone understood: you couldn’t visit the volatile regions.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” she said. Her eyes looked daubed with blush. “I’d hoped not to show you.”</p>
<p>“No, thanks. I—”</p>
<p>“Right,” she said. “You shouldn’t.”</p>
<p>“Of course not. I can’t.”</p>
<p>She replayed the video without sound. The jump cuts flashed rhythmically. The colors seemed brighter, the action quicker. Men’s mouths formed O’s of silent exaltation. Will turned away at the end, but Regina didn’t. She stared as the screen’s glow brightened over her face, her own mouth slowly expanding into an oval. Then she closed the laptop screen and the room fell dark.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>He drove back to his apartment so slowly two cars honked at him. There did not seem to be a road; he drove mechanically, by memory. The lights of opposing vehicles refracted as if through prisms. When he stared at them without focusing, the gyre of light widened until it diffused and his sight refocused on the narrow beams. There must have been a parking space; there must have been a walk to the door.</p>
<p>Inside his apartment, he stood at his bedroom window. He lived with his roommate on the third floor, overlooking the park at the base of the loamy hills where he’d once picnicked with Regina. A memorial service consecrated the park—the bobbing candles looked like a revolving galaxy. He blocked out the view and leaned his head against the window. It cooled a strip on his forehead. All the distant sounds of a neighbor revving a car and his roommate’s television drained away. Each breath expanded and deflated his entire frame, the air reaching even his thighs, his head, until even his breath vanished, and he felt motionless, suspended in a vat of fluid. His head grew light, as though the blood flushed from his brain and coalesced in his chest. Then he sensed, behind eyelids, the entire room swell, objects blooming so close that he felt shrunk by their magnitude, and the shifting sizes disoriented him. His ears hurt; his equilibrium swam. It tilted him, made him drift. This time, he didn’t fight it. He let the objects press against him, overwhelm him. He sensed his own body enlarging to match their dilated size and was not afraid.</p>
<p>When he finally opened his eyes, he felt it. A breaker had flipped, and all of the uncertainty had settled and flattened. This he realized: all the reasons were stacked against his going, and he would still do it. He was meant to fling himself into a future he could not read. He went down to the computer, placed in the public space of the living room to encourage moral internet habits. From the kitchen came the sounds of his roommate, the shuffle of socks and clack of dishware. Although Will knew precisely what airline, what time, what website, he still ran one last check, to confirm someone hadn’t scaled the price down. He had a distressing vision that the airline had swooned out of business or that rising oil had spiked the ticket price, but nothing had changed.</p>
<p>When he pressed the button to buy the plane ticket, he remembered a cliff in Mexico, at the lip of the frothy sea. After his short-term team had finished building houses, they’d gone to the Caribbean coast and taken turns jumping from this cliff. It wasn’t too high, only about twenty feet, but when he was on top, it looked more like forty. The waves came in, the waves left. A sliding hue of dark blue, light blue, and grainy beige. If he didn’t time the leap right, he’d hit rock. He measured the rhythms and coaxed his heartbeat into preparing his legs. Then the moment of ditching the ground, of sailing out and over. His throat tightening up. Arms flailing. Legs flexed from the force of the jump. The bubbling up of vertigo, the uplift of a freefall armed with only timing and hope. It was a feeling he’d missed.</p>
<p>Back in his bedroom, gripping a printout of the confirmation number, he eyed his backpack and closet, knowing it was too soon to pack but already cataloguing the list of supplies. A chamois instead of a towel. Pure DEET instead of the diluted version because it took less space. Pants that zipped off to make shorts. He tasted tears before he realized he was crying. He wiped them from his smiling lips and left them on his cheeks. Though he hoped she would forgive him, he felt that she would not. In the center of the room, surrounded by the debris that would soon be separated into staying and going, he held out his hands, palms up, clenching and releasing, clenching and releasing. It felt good. He kept repeating the motion, imagining spheres rising from his opening palms to drift along the ceiling, each departing one reducing his weight until he felt he might float. Then he thought he heard, perhaps from the kitchen or from even farther, someone say his name.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After four months, the fever withdrew into her,</p>
<p>past the vanishing point, and now it was impossible</p>
<p>to remember how fully it had filled her,</p>

<p>the traffic thinned to a word—so we split a cigarette</p>
<p>on the porch with the speaker in the window</p>
<p>and listened to Robert Johnson press his voice</p>
<p>against the City (—a crystal quivering in the microphone).</p>
<p>The heavy book in my hands never opened—</p>
<p>it was there only to keep me still.</p>
<p>When the last song ended, the notes dropped</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[Selected by <em>Wiglaff</em> magazine as one of the best 50 short short stories published in 2011.]</strong></p>
<p>Where do they find these animals? The halt and the lame, the half-blind, the<br /> parboiled, the skeptical showered in the alkaloid mud of a corral hammered slant behind<br /> T. Murphy’s Snowmobile Shop. A fat pair of jacks, Arnold and Rooster, appear to be<br /> twins. One has a roached mane. The other dandles fetlocks as curly as Buffalo Bill<br /> Cody’s bleached mustache. Little Tom Petsch, the farrier, claims they can carry a load.<br /> “Dead broke,” he says. “Climb a hill like a cat.” Little Tom owes back taxes to the<br /> county, has a fetish for German handguns. He doesn’t believe he knows me. I suss<br /> out the truss-hipped jenny that is said to come from Arizona where working the Grand<br /> Canyon separates the wheat from the dog food. She’s as narrow as a mill race, the color<br /> of wet Absaroka Mountain scree. She looks hungry for something. Her pumpjack head<br /> primes the bony lever of her neck. I see how the tendons in her forelegs have been pin-<br /> fired, a piss-poor job of it too. Futile. She’ll never tread the straight path again. The<br /> wind looses its wet lash across the spine of Carter Mountain. The jenny works her lips<br /> around stalks of cold, icy air. Her belly is salted with the eggs of absconded flies. I read<br /> the spackle of her scattered scars as indebted starlight, as ash.</p>

It is 1842 and Napoleon has returned to Paris<br />
as body-ash grey as the iron Seine,<br />
Fuseli and Lavater have worked all winter painting<br />
the soul’s character to flesh, each high forehead<br />
a cathedral vaulted for the mind,<br />
and in Italy Francesco Hayez paints this girl,<br />
not so much a portrait as a study, the oval<br />
of her face flattened and white as a cameo.<br />
He paints her disheveled as the rumpled flowers<br />
he places before her as if she, too, were perfumed<br />
to lush disintegration, her bodice a waxy sheet<br />
draped to falling, the lilies enveloped<br />
in their private fluted mouths. He extends no grace<br />
to her, but lets the light from one window<br />
cut down the side of her face, her dress<br />
pooling as if he can’t help himself, can’t stop<br />
unlocking in his mind the pearly sheen<br />
of each elasticized button, though she is sullen<br />
and slouched as any preteen, awkward<br />
in her new layers, and, in the muddied pools of her eyes,<br />
he paints the whole of her psyche in concentric rings,<br />
at once over-taxed as her mother and extravagantly<br />
swollen, a child in the mane of her disillusionment.<br />
Even the cross he gilds mid-fall, but she doesn’t catch it,<br />
doesn’t rearrange herself like a girl at the pool<br />
tugging up her suit, no, her hands<br />
are stiff in her dress, listless to deformity.<br />
Her face is like one who will take a beating<br />
without flinching, and isn’t that what this is,<br />
as she stands for him who cowers behind the screen<br />
of his canvas, he who props her up<br />
before the blank brick and tugs the dress<br />
from alignment, convincing himself he’s caught her<br />
in her undressed mind, this girl for whom<br />
martyrdom means holding very still<br />
that he can make of her madness and sex?<br />
In another century, a poet thinks himself<br />
the wind God and she the harp he’ll run the string<br />
of his breath through like bell-song, and like Chloris<br />
she lies for him, a burnished shell, her cones<br />
filling with his notes, though before long<br />
his flora clots in her throat, blood-flakes fern<br />
from her lips, and her own sound is stopped, guttural<br />
in her long white throat. What a familiar myth<br />
they enacted before the stone and ivy wall of Cambridge,<br />
1956, his arm yoking her as it would for seven years,<br />
her girlish smile, light trolling the shadows. Here solidity<br />
is defined by her vanishing, the aural white;<br />
he grows larger as she less palpable. Must there always be<br />
a vanishing twin in this unnatural partnership,<br />
or else the two-headed monster they became when she spoke,<br />
anger ticking in her throat? Hayez called his portrait Melancholia<br />
as though he knew her, knew what darkened her pupils<br />
to crushed pencil points was desire for annihilation, but it was he<br />
who wanted to see her ripe for the taking, as if there were nothing<br />
more to do with her but lift the seashell-blue<br />
of her dress and punish her as she asks to be punished.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Juan Julio could describe the misfortune with a soft clarity, so that the impression he left upon the listener was that of a tune hummed from a porch step, during the long liquid hours of the first, floating dark.</p>
<p>That it was a brutal and tragic tale did not diminish the gentleness of its comprehension, such was Juan Julio’s skill. Neither did the fact that it was a steaming, hundred degree day, heavy as the rain clouds that ballooned about the sky above the pasture. As his men labored at a distance, sawing and trimming out tree foliage that threatened the power lines, he told the story again, and the old man at his side – a doctor to whose farm the crew had been sent – stood privy to the pressure of Juan Julio’s romance.</p>
<p>“They sent us after the hurricane, down to a place too far from the city for the cameras to come, too far from the sea for people to know of. Old people lived there – the old, poor ones – the kind who cannot be driven from their homes – even by the promise of more to eat and less to do and a cooler place to do it in. The old poor ones who will not surrender what they have always seen, even if it is the worst of things. They live very close to the world they know, these people, and must be let alone there –  even by those who come to offer more. No good can come of that, even if good is meant.”</p>
<p>The drone of the saws lamenting against the green wood drew closer, made it harder for Dr. Priest to hear. So the old man stepped within a few feet of the Mexican, and positioned himself so that his best ear was nearest the tale.</p>
<p>Dr. Priest had lived his whole life in this town, the last half of it on this farm, and had never met a Mexican. But these five were all from there, as was every other man who came to the place now – to haul horses, to fix water mains, to read the meter. They worked from a white service truck, with a cherry-picker to lift one man up to the level of the interlaced elms, hackberries and sumacs that crowded the phone lines. As this man toiled from the bucket with his saw, two others labored on the ground to clear the falling debris and feed it into a wood chipper. Down on the road that faced the doctor’s land, a fifth man drove a tractor with a boom cutter. A platform of blades whirled at the end of an arm reaching from the machine to the bordering trees. Even at a distance, the savage munch and chop of the low-lying limbs made Dr. Priest wince – made his small, rheumy eyes tear.</p>
<p>“So they sent us after the hurricane,” Juan Julio continued, “streaming down the branch-filled roads in our trucks, caught in the trail of the storm’s pull – to this land that was more cage than world, trapped within its own being – as though the whole place had sat upon a cloth, and that cloth upon a table. And then, at some moment, the four corners had been taken up, to let all that lay upon the surface plunge in upon itself – this way and that – over and under and against – until it made no sense anymore. They sent us there with orders to make the world straight – to make even that for which we had no north or south, and of which we knew no history – none with which to make what was into what had been.”</p>
<p>Juan Julio wiped his forehead with the meat of his forearm, so that the flesh glistened in the early afternoon light.</p>
<p>He was as tall as Dr. Priest had been, before age had stooped him. But besides his status and his formal air, there was a marked difference between the foreman and the others. They were little and mustachioed, and they veiled their black eyes beneath dusty, close-fitting caps. But Juan Julio was clean-shaven and hatless, his hair cut short in a military style. He wore crisp khakis and a fresh polo shirt. Only his boots showed the scuff that might be expected.  His eyes were bright and direct, and though he had an accent, his English was smooth, schooled; Dr. Priest could not understand the others.</p>
<p>“What you see now” – Juan Julio pointed to the workers – “we did then, there, in that place. Except the earth was no longer set out in the squares that mark men’s claims.”</p>
<p>The chain saw broke through the circumference of a limb, so that a mighty crack sounded as the blade caught its breath. The two men on the ground struggled to untangle the fallen bough from the lower foliage. Then a gloss of new sunlight broke onto the pasture, free to bathe the weeds and fescue.</p>
<p>“It would have been all right,” Juan Julio said, “had we been the same kind of people.  In a strange place, there must be something you can count on. The men beside you must know the things you do.”</p>
<p>“These you see here,” he said, and pointed to the workers, “these with me – they all come from my village in Nuevo León. They have done this work a long time, and each knows his role.  With a duty such as ours, with a task such as that, to make the world even and plain, there is no room for questions. The problem is what to do, not how to do it – where to start, not how one starts to begin with.”</p>
<p>Juan Julio frowned, considered what he had said. Then he remade his point.</p>
<p>“My grandfather told me. In a battle, the questions are small: from which direction to fight – head-on, or from the flank? – but not questions about how to hold a sword. The men must already know such things; they must be soldiers by that time, not still farmers.”</p>
<p>He stopped, wiped his brow again. Dr. Priest stepped closer.</p>
<p>“But we were not the same men.”</p>
<p>Because those they sent were of all types, all skills, and many were not fit for the task. They were men for different times, for a known world – men who worked with hand tools, who sawed lumber from a mill, who masoned brick fresh from a mold, or managed water that ran within pipes. The work they did only made sense when the place itself did, when houses lined streets, and trees rose from mown grass. They were not men for a place with no line between outside or in – when water lapped at windows and trees lay down like the slain. Even the men from Juan Julio’s crew were unsure of their way, though clearing the land was their native task.</p>
<p>“Even we had to scrape the earth,” said Juan Julio, “to find traces of a drive, a road, a curb – some paved corner that would tell us where to lay the teeth of the saw.”</p>
<p>It was as though they were chipping away at an ice wall, to uncover the bones of a primitive beast, or sweeping the floor of a pit, to reveal the stones of an ancient culture – trying to retrieve a thing or a place that the earth had swallowed up with its slow brown mouth.  In such times, when even the master is unsure of his craft, it is madness to employ the novice – and criminal to arm him with means.</p>
<p>“But that is what happened,” said Juan Julio.</p>
<p>In fact, they all suspected the days themselves lay under a spell, as if the confusion of the landscape had broken in upon the fabric of a recollected life, breached the judgment of those who – at any other moment in the regular course of existence – would know better than to mix such unlike things, or to permit so careless an enterprise. Their wits, dazzled by what they saw, made fools of the lot, so that if a mere child had presented himself at the dawn of a day’s labor, he would not only have gone unchallenged, but would have been fitted straight away with a blade broader than his waist, and manned with a canister of gas, a box of matches.</p>
<p>“We were dizzy with fatigue, and our thirst could not be slaked, though we drank constantly. The work we did was poor, careless – even that of the skilled. The best of us gave place to the least, and even a good job started would likely end in frustration – broken tools, lack of oil, lost directions.”</p>
<p>Juan Julio swallowed.</p>
<p>“But mostly we were frightened, milling about in the footprints of a monster, clearing the ruin of her wrath. And no matter what they told us – who could say that she would not turn back, retrace her steps,  come for those who erased the marks she’d meant to leave? We slept in fits, fought often. Hate came easily.”</p>
<p>More than once Juan Julio had studied a man’s neck, then gauged the size and strength of his own hands.</p>
<p>“I am ashamed of this now,” he said, looking away. “But it is true, and I tell it to atone for what I desired.”</p>
<p>Dr. Priest closed his eyes, nodded. He had been in war. He had known the same thing that the Mexican spoke of and had done worse than just ponder it. Not only had he done worse, what’s more, he had lived to know of other things, worse yet.</p>
<p>“It was a hazy day,” said Juan Julio, his voice rising to the pitch of the saws.</p>
<p>“None of us mentioned the pale fog that hung in the air, but we noticed and worried why it should be. Was it fire, eating its way toward us, silently – a blaze that would all at once send flames from the tangled brush, at a point too late to run?”</p>
<p>But they could not smell smoke. So was it rain? The mist of some early child of a storm, thrust from the giant’s hollow, now growing into a menace of its own – to undo what little good they had realized?</p>
<p>“But the clouds were high that day, and the wind was docile. So how could it be rain?”</p>
<p>Still, there it hung, as though they had stepped within a curse for which they were ignorant of both the deserving and the unfolding. All day they rubbed their eyes, waved their hands before their faces – but none spoke of what he saw.</p>
<p>Perhaps that was why they misunderstood. They had thought that the meaning of the day would be related to the purpose of the haze; that what fogged their sight would prove their undoing; if not of all, then of some; if not of some, then of only one. Perhaps it was this error that had caused what happened, because they were so intent upon the source – fire, water, evil – that their attentions were divided; the mélange of half-skills and muddled wits, the lack of a voice to speak to, or to bring order from, the chaos that surrounded them. Engrossed, absorbed, they had looked for the mist to mean something, and had been caught unawares, facing the wrong way.</p>
<p>Juan Julio turned to the road, pointed to the tractor that inched slowly along the border. The arm at its side held out the flat mouth of blades, like a head at the end of a neck – like the unhinged jaws of a reptile – to the trapped and waiting trunks. Dr. Priest’s gaze followed the man’s finger; the tops of the trees quaked as the violence tore at them from beneath.</p>
<p>“I had been working with the tractor, guiding the boom so that it lay against a snarl of trees and undergrowth. The arm would catch at times, buck and bounce, when placed against a mass too thick for it to eat. Two men trailed behind me, pulling away the cuttings and piling them into heaps. I could not see them, but I knew that they were there.”</p>
<p>The work was slow, the man explained; twenty feet an hour, along a roadside they had discovered only the day before.</p>
<p>“The people to whom the road led had been trapped, cut off from provisions, and it was feared they would stay there, starve and rot, rather than leave their homes unattended. So we worked on, all day. There was no rest. Without a word to each other, we began to take odd turns at the labor – shifts unequal in both length and difficulty.”</p>
<p>From time to time, some man or woman, filthy and wide-eyed, would step out from the wooded maze with a can of some sort – for gas or water – and tell of the need that lay behind them, in the direction in which they were headed.</p>
<p>“I am not sure if that was on that day, but it seems as though I worked so long that the shudder and rattle of the machine leached through my skin and into my bones, so that it shot through and burned them – as though I had held fast to an electric wire, as though the wire held me as I held it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped, smiled. His eyes broke free of their frozen width.</p>
<p>“That is what they say it is like, Doctor. Is it not?”</p>
<p>The old man nodded; so he had heard; like your skin, meat, vessels, your very heart, were being sifted through a wire screen, pulped and pulsed through a grill. Once, as an intern, he alone had been made to sit with a room full of electrocuted men. The metal scaffold upon which they were working had been pushed into a transformer. There was nothing that could be done but watch them convulse, writhing as the mortal shock tossed them about from within, like an animal trying to free itself from a cocoon.</p>
<p>“At some point, I stopped, climbed down; I do not remember whether I meant for someone to relieve me. I do not recall asking for such a thing. But I remember stepping aside as someone brushed past, climbed into the cab, started the motor, then the cutter.”</p>
<p>He continued to point towards the road; Dr. Priest watched on – as the tractor crawled, as the cutter gnawed.</p>
<p>“Why did I do that?” he asked the old man. “Step away? I cannot answer. I remember walking off, my back to the business behind, as if my home lay on the other side of the trees, and my wife had called me to supper. I remember that I stopped, surprised to see my feet, and wondered how I had come to be there. I put my hand to my head.”</p>
<p>He did so again, brushing his brow as if the doctor had asked to him to repeat the gesture, so as to unfold the symptoms of some malady.</p>
<p>“They tell me I had worked for eight hours, straight. They tell me I had taken no water. Those things I cannot remember, though I recall the size of my tongue. What is true, it is impossible to say now. Because though I did not see it, as I stood there, the new man in the cab lurched the machine forward, so that it bucked on its axle, one wheel catching – spinning in the mud.”</p>
<p>The Mexican turned sideways, threw out his hip to mimic the thing’s massive pitch.</p>
<p>“The boom snapped the pins that held it fast, so that it swung free, turned back on the two men behind. One leapt clear; but not the other.”</p>
<p>Juan Julio said that the thing had destroyed the man in a scale of ways, as though it could not decide on the right manner in which to kill him. His arm, shorn from the shoulder cap, was slung into the cleared space, where it laid there, stretched out properly, formally – while the flesh of his back and side were chewed, as though by a pack of savage dogs. Then there were two great slashes, one from the man’s ear to his chest, stopping at a point half way; the other from his collar to his hip, almost clean through, so that he lay on the ground in a curve, like a spring coiled at an angle upon the grass.</p>
<p>“It was a neat death,” the Mexican explained, the cuts so great that the blood came in gouts rather than showers. He died with his remaining arm curled beneath him, his face held in his hand, and that hand upon the earth.</p>
<p>“As if he were ashamed of the way he had ended. As if his wounds were his sins, and he must hide his eyes from judgment.”</p>
<p>When Juan Julio was finished, he stepped back from the old man. The tale itself might have laid upon the ground, marked with stones – a small cairn of sorrow.</p>
<p>Dr. Priest observed the silence, or such of it as there was.</p>
<p>The men were still laboring in the trees. But even after a few moments had passed, and the workers were further down the way, he could not bring himself to ask the Mexican more. Juan Julio had finished, and to call him back to the story would be an offense. Dr. Priest had always respected the delicacy of endings.</p>
<p>Still, as the sun lumbered through the sky, and as the old man made his way back through the shadowless pasture to the house – the crew having finished for the day – he wondered about the one who had died.</p>
<p>What had they done with his body, way out there in the heat, so far down in the bayou? Even here, hours north of the Coast, they had lost power for a week and had been stranded for days on end. Isolated, what had they done with the remains?</p>
<p>He opened the door to the house, stood in the kitchen and let the frigid air dry his sweat into a carapace. But he did not feel like ending the day just yet. With a glass of iced tea, he went back outside and sat on the gallery swing.</p>
<p>It was the time of summer when the light barely surrendered the sky; hours from now, he knew, there would still be hours yet before dark. Night was a scarce thing now, but he scarcely missed it.</p>
<p>In the past, he would never have believed that possible. Once, it was all he had longed for: a cloaked, unbroken chain of rest, with no calls to rouse and summons. It had been such a rare thing. Now, his wife had to badger him from his chair in the late evenings, force him to sleep in the bed. He rose well before dawn; he kept the house lit.</p>
<p>From his vantage in the swing, he could view one of his favorite sights – his small herd of Angus making its way back from a pond in the far pasture. Once raised for profit, now they were a hobby – in truth, even less; now they were part of a vignette, something to adorn the property, to make it quaint, precious. The noise for the past few days had disturbed their routine, driving them across the field to escape it. But with the men gone, the cattle seemed to have settled down again. The line moved lazily back to the upper grasses, to resume their constant, singular task.</p>
<p>He set the swing into a gentle rock, pushing off with his toe.</p>
<p>At some point in the coming days, Dr. Priest would find a time to ask Juan Julio his questions. What was the man like? For example; the one who had died. Did Juan Julio know him? Was he even a man? For the Mexican called all of his workers “men,” when two of them were clearly no more than boys. And most importantly, what had become of the driver? Was he punished? Sued? Did he go mad with grief and guilt?</p>
<p>The sun was reaching the point in the afternoon when it fell level with the roof line, and hence shot a cannon of light beneath the gallery eaves. For the time being, it only blazed across his feet and shins. But soon the glare would drive him from his place.</p>
<p>He lifted the glass and ran it along his forehead, then down the sides of his cheeks. He had begun to sweat again, despite the ceiling fans that hung down from the gallery roof.</p>
<p>There would be a moment he could ask such things, about the man, about Juan Julio; there was still much work to do. The pasture was long, and the other side of the property was ribboned with another set of lines that had to be cut back as well.</p>
<p>Juan Julio and his crew would return.</p>
<p>They had taken a liking to each other from the first, he and the Mexican; at least Dr. Priest had fancied as much. He would admit this was partly due to the fact that he enjoyed any new thing that presented itself in a day. It had been such a long time since he’d had a reason for his rising.</p>
<p>But on the first morning, they had come unexpectedly. His wife had sent him to see who was at the door. Juan Julio stood outside the foyer, formally, as though he’d come for a visit. He’d explained that the county had hired and sent them; that it was time to care for the lines. Five years had passed, by the municipal schedule, since the trees had been cut back. They had to be shorn.</p>
<p>Dr. Priest, then and there, had said that his wife did not care for such things. She valued her trees, no matter how far across the farm that they travelled, no matter whose power was threatened by their height. He’d related how others had butchered the foliage before, turning branches into stubs and knobs, leaving the whole avenue ragged and unsightly. The Mexican listened, respected such a thing, even agreed with it. Then he invited Dr. Priest to watch them, to object if their work was severe.</p>
<p>Dr. Priest had been amazed at such an offer, somehow even honored by it.</p>
<p>The schedule of the men’s task saved him from the confusion his days had become since his practice was closed; a confusion that was worse now, not better, as all had said it would be. Worse with every year, in fact, and it had been many since he quit. It seemed that a door was always closing these days – things of any purpose being wrapped up and handed along. He could not content himself with avocations – sports, books, horses, even his cattle – and pretend that they were a life. This annoyed him greatly. He would not admit it, but he longed for things to break – pipes to freeze in the winter, roof tin to blow from the barn – so that he could call for repairmen to come and then follow the workers as they plied their crafts. So when Juan Julio arrived with his crew, unbidden, it was a great and welcome surprise.</p>
<p>Every morning, the old man showered, had his coffee, dressed for the heat of the coming day. To discourage mosquitoes, he pulled his athletic socks to his knees, where they met the hem of his baggy shorts, so that he looked like a small, knickered boy. He wore T-shirts given to him by grandchildren, ones that needed shrinking to fit – team logos emblazoned on the front – a baseball cap and dark glasses. Then he went out to meet them, down to the end of the road, with keys to open the gate. There was a mist in the air – thick as bees – as though the sun had walked the earth before his rising, left traces of itself in the light, like pollen floating in dew.</p>
<p>What he had said that afternoon, Juan Julio – of the storm, of the man split in two – was only the latest tale he’d related. Over the days that had passed, the Mexican spoke of other catastrophes: a dustbowl at the border, with desperate men hanging beneath the truck on the axles so as to cross; a gang of bandits, skulking like trolls beneath a bridge, to take a cut of their earnings when they passed. But more often, Juan Julio spoke of his endeavors, his skill at commerce. The poles about the fence rows were draped with three lines, and as the men cleared them with patience and care, Dr. Priest heard of the younger man’s endeavors.</p>
<p>“I bought my first truck with five year’s earnings,” Juan Julio had said. “My second, I bought with the earnings of three. I brought up more men from my village, along with my brother, who watches the second crew, just as I do these.”</p>
<p>It turned out that he nearly had money for a third, what with the extra funds the government had paid him for working after the storm. He spoke of all these things with a charming pride.</p>
<p>Whenever they broke for lunch, the men sat at the fence line, wrapped in the shade they were soon to destroy, and opened their iceboxes. Dr. Priest would leave them, return to the house for a time. There, as he picked at the meal his wife had cooked too much of, he would explain the progress being made. But whenever he heard the still heat broken by the saw’s wail, he would reseat his cap upon his plastered hair and set out for the pasture again. Sometimes he brought them lemonade or iced tea; sometimes he brought them the rest of a cake his wife had made.</p>
<p>“If my men get drunk,” Juan Julio had told him, “they stay home. They make their choice. They don’t eat if they don’t work. If they chose to drink instead of eat – all right – they do as they wish. But they don’t work, beg though they may. They are responsible for themselves. They owe me nothing, but then I pay them nothing.”</p>
<p>The men were careful around Juan Julio, and he watched them like a schoolmaster. He said he collected them for mass on Sundays, and took them to the hospital if they absolutely had to go. But he himself kept a case full of medicines and antiseptics for their minor illnesses. This he had Dr. Priest review, to see if his store was adequate for the purpose.</p>
<p>It seemed that Juan Julio would speak to his men only when it was time to move the truck, or when it was time to take a break. Dr. Priest had even asked the Mexican why they needed such a scarcity of instruction.</p>
<p>It was because he had trained them so well. And he knew so well how to train them because this was how he had started.</p>
<p>“For years I cut, I cleared, I drove the machine. But with a difference,” he had said, between him and the others. “I saw more than my hands.”</p>
<p>The cattle were all back in the field now, bloated with water, heads declined for the grass. He heard his wife stirring in the house, a business that never ended; he was envious, and sometimes aggravated, that her life had never transformed, never changed. He got in her way, now that he had no way of his own, but her path was the same as it had ever been.</p>
<p>He leaned out from his seat to see the browned foliage of a dead evergreen at the corner of the house. That afternoon, before the men had left, he had asked Juan Julio to cut it down. It had been a Christmas tree thirty years ago. And there was a picture of it in a drawer or book somewhere, decorated with lights and balls, and a message along the white border: “tree at corner of house.” A live spruce of some sort, it was a better choice for Christmas than it was for the yard, as it had grown twice as tall as the roof, and its jealous breadth crowded the way around. But a drought the summer before had killed it; heaps of brown needles littered the ground, and desiccated branches were prey to the wind. Dr. Priest offered Juan Julio fifty dollars on the side if he would remove it.</p>
<p>He leaned back in the swing, drank the last of his tea.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, the Mexican would take the tree down, for two twenties and a ten—a week’s wages, when Dr. Priest was in his training. But a man like Juan Julio could make a great deal from so little. A man like that knew how to get along.</p>
<p>He rattled the ice against the glass.</p>
<p>It used to be that way for Priest himself. He cleared; he cut; he cleaned.</p>
<p>But now, when stillness is all that is asked of him, he recollects nothing but motion, as though in all the years before he had been hooked to a line, one that had rushed him through a torrent of borderless, numberless days. Back then, he had been all hands, all eyes, all feet. Now, he moved through their recollections like a man through a museum. They limn out from shadow, and his fingers itch at their sight.</p>
<p>There was the child he had seen on a table, as though sleeping, except that the flesh of his trunk was peeled back, his organs, shy and small, still as a stopped clock. And a rodeo rider, calm as pond water, sitting on a gurney, though a bull had hooked a horn into his mouth, then out through the orbit of his eye. There was his son, a young boy, curled and sleeping in the wheel wells as Priest drove through the night to make calls – in the days when you went to houses; in the days when they came to yours. With his wife sleeping next to him, he had handed syringes through the window to a man needing tetanus shots; he had stepped on a nail in a junkyard, and had knocked on the window to rouse him. There were people full of water, so bloated he’d been forced to use a bucket to bail it all clear; there were children fed through a feed mill augur; a girl, ravaged by a hog; a man’s face, split open by an oak plank shot backwards from a saw mill wood planer – his frantic eyes staring out on either side of a cracked skull, demolished nose, cleft palate – Priest had run a wire through his cheeks to stabilize his face. Stab wounds on Saturday nights, lungs near to collapse, tubes pushed through to inflate them. The poor had born gifts – turnips, collards, pole beans; they had known his father, they had known his grandfather; he took the sacks and gave them to the orderlies, then marked the bills paid. And phone calls he would make – after tests had been run – good news to bring – that it was nothing; that it was all right; that there was time after all, years and years of a life left.</p>
<p>He stared at his tea glass, trying to remember why he had become confused.</p>
<p>Soon it will be time for supper, a thought that made him sigh. He will tell his wife he is not hungry, then they will argue over this fact, as they do every night. In the end, he will have a bowl of cereal before he goes to bed. His appetite is that of a child.</p>
<p>When he is done with his meal, he will walk down to close the gate, then return to sit here, to watch for the lightening bugs. She will read by the television, talk on the phone, plans visits from their children, grandchildren. Holidays seem increasingly desperate now – too many people eager to be too nice, to stare too long. They watch him closely, gauge how much he eats, try too hard to amuse him, and wonder at his rest – is it enough, is it too much? He knows what they think; he has thought such things himself, from bedsides.</p>
<p>The line of the sun was nearly level with his face. He took a detached interest in its progress, as its heat climbed up his legs, his hips, his chest, like anesthesia as the table is tipped.</p>
<p>“You won’t remember this,” he would say to the man who lay there. “I’ll call your name when it’s over.”</p>
<p>He shuts his eyes.</p>
<p>The story of the hurricane had troubled Juan Julio. Priest sees that now. The man had wanted to tell it, and had probably told it often, if others would listen. And it was not so much that he wanted to be comforted as to understand why he had been confused, why he had climbed down and let some other take his place.</p>
<p>For at that moment, the Mexican had lost his peace, like a coin dropped from his pocket, and now he wanted to make it good. He wanted for there to be chances, possibilities, likelihoods—that would crowd it out or give it purpose&#8211;prospects and options; he wanted assurance that there would be field upon field to work through; and even if he had not done this, he could yet do that—even if not all was accomplished today, then there was still the day to come. Most of all—if indeed he had failed, there would yet be successes.</p>
<p>For now he is caught in the storm, Juan Julio, and for now he cannot see his way clear. It worries him—which is why his clothes are so clean, his hair brushed so well. Yes, he was always earnest, but he is more so now; he is meticulous to a fault, now. The Mexican will let nothing spill, will leave not a scrap of trash. His men must follow every rule, and his rigor with time is that of a saint. He is prepared, alert. In his mind, he is forever telling himself where he is, what he is doing, what he is yet to do – so that he will not be caught out again; so that he will not be found dreaming.</p>
<p>But he had time to atone; he should know that. The more and longer he lived, the more he could tell the tale, again and again, until his labors drove it from his mind. That was what Dr. Priest wanted to say; that peace he could bring the man, and would when he returned: that he had time. There were years yet, barring some other fate – years in which he could work. Years for someone to expect him, and for his sheer toil to make over, reclaim, build back. He could set this bone for a bone that could not be set, cut out this mass for the one too large to cut, apply this pressure (heel of hand on back of hand, and heel of hand on wound) for that which could not be dammed. Raise the near dead, for the dead that could not be raised.</p>
<p>For he has seen its face, what every man fears. He was the one they clutched after realizing, at last, that love alone could not save them – not their wives or husbands or children, but him – only him – when blood and history and friendship held no power against a rampant disease, a failing heart, time. And he would rise at such a thing, his muscles taut and tight; he would rise at what they believed of him – and talk to them like an angel with a sword in his mouth.</p>
<p>Now, the days are full of skies that will not rain, that beg a purpose they are not given. And he will not be let to answer, not be let to offer or speak, test or try. Like a horse in a barn that sees a field through his door, he stamps at his place. Though he has legs still, and a heart, and lungs and blood, he will not be let to run over it, not even to stumble and fall.</p>
<p>Now he rises at night, ready, prepared, if only they will let him; he looks for a task, for a thing to make right, for succor to bring. If they would let him. He hunts the corners of the house, the places of recess, as if they hold a discovery, a mute cry, fraught eyes.</p>
<p>He could be ready; he would need little. He had restored a man’s wind with a pen knife; he had tied off a vein with some twine.</p>
<p>They must be let through, he had decided. The lines must be let through – to carry answers, voices, questions put. Though they damaged and distorted the living – broke between the green, pulsing world with their naked purpose – their way must be cleared, given place. They ran between things, and they must be prepared, to stand and wait for their time. They must be ready, as he was, always – even now – to say to those who called, who held up the bright, red water of their need: be still – bring me the light; hold it here; this is the way.</p>

<p>Commentary by Catherine Anderson</p>
<p>Many times throughout the process of reading Pinckney Benedict’s <em>Miracle Boy and Other Stories</em> I wanted to put the book down and stop, but I’m glad I didn’t. In a few of the stories, the violence, horror, and creepiness was so heavy that it was difficult for me to parse through, but by the end of the collection, I had developed a tolerance (and maybe even a sort of appreciation) for Benedict’s use of the strange and shocking as a means of presenting the reader with meaningful commentary on the ordinary and the very real and meaningful. Initially, I also found the use of Southern farm settings to be repetitive, and it kind of left me feeling like an outsider since I don’t share this background with Benedict and his characters. However, I can now recognize some merit in the pairing of this ordinary, farming world (which became familiar even to me after several stories) with the mythical and fantastical world that his stories also enter into. This juxtaposition seems to link reality and impossibility in an important way, so that readers can accept the meanings in Benedict’s stories without being too shocked or confused to absorb them. Overall, with the exception of a few stories that just didn’t fit with my personal taste, this collection was definitely worth the read. It didn’t leave me feeling warm and fuzzy inside, but it certainly left me thinking.</p>
<p>Commentary by Tracy Richardson</p>
<p><em>Miracle Boy</em> is a collection of stories that is very region specific, and utilizes cultural references from a distinct part of the United States. I was wary at first that, because the collection is so focused upon an area I am unfamiliar with, I would be unable to relate to the characters or find moments for introspection within the stories. However, after the first story, I was immediately pulled into this world, and Benedict’s carefully articulated spiritual allusions and almost psychological commentary really helped me connect with the work. <em>Miracle Boy</em> shines as a collection that, while very specific in setting, has a persuasive universality that appeals to a broad readership. Anyone curious about the human spirit will be provoked by this book that constantly surprises. Ultimately, I found myself both immersed and challenged in Benedict’s world that is intriguing, haunting, and often beautiful. This collection is certainly no light read, but it is great example of writing that can lead to insightful discussion with others as well as quiet contemplation within an individual.</p>
<p>Commentary by Mary Olive Keller</p>
<p>Benedict’s <em>Miracle Boy</em> contains scenarios so peculiar, they are almost unimaginable. Talking dogs, horses that roll their eyes, living robots, and human-to-animal transformations are simply a few of the irregular storylines. Once my frustration from continual bewilderment subsided, though, I realized that beyond their bizarre exterior, these stories address universal themes. Heritage, morality, disloyalty, faith, and discrimination are some of the collection’s recurrent topics. After I began to recognize the core underlying issues, I ultimately came to appreciate the inventiveness of these stories. My favorite story, “The Beginnings of Sorrow,” is arguably one of the collection’s most peculiar works (and that’s really saying something). The author manages to depict a stirring, rather than overwhelmingly unappealing, portrayal of such a disconcerting and foreign scenario. Ultimately I say read this work because Benedict breathes a breath of fresh air into popular literary topics. Regardless of the sometimes unappetizing storylines, his ability to provide fourteen distinct and innovative stories truly distinguishes his creative skill.</p>
<p>Commentary by Barbara Knipp</p>
<p>I was caught off guard by the success of Benedict’s collection in terms of its breadth, depth, and variety.  The author managed to weave in strong, specific themes into stories with different characters, settings, and plot developments.  He captured psychological complexities using carefully crafted sentences, diction, and imagery.  Some stories appealed to the heart and others to the imagination.  He opened the doorway into scenes of rural homes and families, painting pictures of farms and fields.  Family history and father/son relationship were resonant themes for me while reading this book.  My favorite story was “Mercy” because of the joyous ending and portrayal of a young boy’s inspiration and determination.  I would recommend this book to those with an appreciation for language and without a fear of the grotesque.</p>
<p>Commentary by Paige Willey</p>
<p>Some short stories I’ve read fall by the wayside, while some stick to you like honey, others rattle around in your brain, demanding your attention. The stories in <em>Miracle Boy </em>are the kind that rattle. Ranging from the tender, to the intriguing, to the unusual, these stories can neither be passively read nor remembered. Pinckney Benedict’s deft language and thought-provoking subjects must be approached with time and care, if only to revel in a fine turn of phrase or meditate over a surprising story line. While the range of stories ensures no one will like every piece, it does ensure everyone will like a least one, if not a handful.  I particularly enjoyed the title story for its theme of redemption, suspense, and the sympathy I felt for the characters. From the heart-catching story of a boy who loses his feet and has them reattached, to one of an alien trying to imitate humans, there is something to appreciate and admire in every story.</p>
<p>Commentary by Tim McAleenan</p>
<p>I respect authors who take risks. Far too many writers tell contrived stories that display a lack of imagination and an unwillingness to express any vulnerability, so I appreciate the fact that Pinckney Benedict’s collection of short stories, entitled <em>Miracle Boy</em>, abandons the safe path in favor of bold risk-taking. But unfortunately, I think that the absurdity of Benedict’s story-telling structure dominates the underlying themes of his stories. He typically blends stories of the Southern pastoral with that of the grotesque otherworld, most likely to convey the Faulknerian notion that certain Southern values are immortal and endure regardless of the context. But Benedict’s settings and asides of domestic violence often overshadow his salient points, to the detriment of the reading experience. Reading Pinckney Benedict is like eating a lobster&#8211;you have to crack your way through the shell to get to the meat inside. To be sure, Benedict offers some relevant insights on the frailty of human relationships and the difficulty of finding truth, but often, these lessons become blurry and obfuscated by the relentless barrage of absurd images and preternatural plot twists.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is written in the folios<br />
of foliage starting to catch fire, burn, turn to yellow, red,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;or orange flames</p>
<p>that everyone will fall, flutter to the ground, and be ground down<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to nothing more<br />
than least leaf meal in a winter overcoat’s dark pocket.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At 92 years old<br />
my mother, amateur watercolor artist, feels the forest fire<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;that rages through</p>
<p>the hills around Great Barrington kindle her cold bones’ marrow.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She’s had a new<br />
furnace installed, whose forced hot air will blow her warm this winter</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and fan the fire<br />
within her. She wants “to find homes” for her last 60 watercolors<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;before she dies.</p>
<p>“They’re like children,” she says. “I want to see them go<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;out into the world<br />
and make their way. Or at least someone else should lug them</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to the dump.<br />
Not me!” Hung on her white walls or stashed in cupboards, closets,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;black leather portfolios,</p>
<p>or under beds, she is surrounded by her paintings like a matriarch<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;in a family<br />
reunion photo. Here are the places and seasons she’s lived through.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Within a shady park<br />
along a Parisian boulevard, two lovers kiss on a blue bench, wrap arms<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;around each other as if they</p>
<p>aren’t watercolor, but Carrara marble. A woman in a yellow skirt<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;swishes, bewitches<br />
watchers, sashays by, holding the hand of her thigh-high daughter</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;dressed in a red<br />
smock. April, 1954, and the plane trees spread the green<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;jigsaw puzzle</p>
<p>of their new leafage over everyone. A red car passes, then<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a green one. The afternoon<br />
is stop-and-go. I turn around. On the wall behind me</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I see purple New England<br />
mountains in winter. For the foreground’s snow my mother used<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the negative space of blank</p>
<p>rag paper itself. The gray calligraphy of a frozen creek<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;winds me<br />
toward a weathered, rust-colored barn and silo, behind which</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;stand an outbuilding<br />
and farmhouse with darkened windows. The bare trees’ branches<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;vein the sky,</p>
<p>blotting paper ink-splotched with blacks and grays, plus a few russet sunset<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;streaks to match the barn’s<br />
warped boards. Dusk, below zero, and no one ventures out</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;into this<br />
inhuman cold. Within the clouds’ dark Rorschach, a slow<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;giant caterpillar</p>
<p>with two horns crawls. Last night I programmed for my mother<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a telephone<br />
emergency help system. If she falls in her ground-level</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;condominium and can’t<br />
get up, she has only to push for four seconds the red panic button<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;on the white plastic pendant</p>
<p>she wears about her neck and her telephone will dial 911.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“My watercolors will<br />
be scattered farther than my ashes,” she tells me. “I have</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;pictures all over—<br />
California, England, Hong Kong, China, Dubai. Why I<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;had someone come up</p>
<p>to me at an outdoor art show years ago and say that he saw<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;one of my paintings<br />
in a New York City condo that a realtor walked</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;him through. He asked<br />
if the watercolor came with the condo. The realtor said no.”<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My mother estimates</p>
<p>that over the years she’s sold 600 pictures at the outdoor art shows<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;she used to go to<br />
every summer. To get rid of her last paintings, she gives them</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to silent auctions<br />
at church bazaars. “Once a woman stood all day in front of<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;my watercolor</p>
<p>and wrote down a bigger bid whenever someone else’s<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;topped hers.<br />
She wanted that picture so! I forget what it was of . . .”</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My mother shows me<br />
the painting she plans to donate to the Congregational<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Church’s Christmas</p>
<p>Raffle &amp; Rummage Sale. A gray gravel road leads to a tiny<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;white house<br />
about to be swallowed by the maples’</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;40-foot high<br />
flames. Tomorrow morning I’ll say goodbye to my mother<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and drive my rental car,</p>
<p>a white Chevy Cobalt, back to the airport. Outside her window<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;brittle brown leaves<br />
almost cover the lawn’s gray granite outcrop left millennia ago</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;by a glacier. “How much<br />
will you bid,” wind murmurs through the eaves, “for each charred leaf?”<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I would give my life.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href='http://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/04/dhartres.mp3'>Chartres in the Dark</a></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was almost sunset<br />
when the cathedral rose out of the rolling December farmland,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;fields still green</p>
<p>with winter wheat. One moment there was nothing but horizon<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and muddy sky.<br />
Then its two gray spires appeared as we drove over the next</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;hill. I first saw<br />
those red and blue rose windows—muted sunlight flooding through<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;leaded petals—</p>
<p>when I was 15, the age of our younger daughter Lucy. Because that dark<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;light had branded<br />
its afterimage on my brain, I was taking my family</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;37 years later<br />
to Chartres to show them stained-glass sunrise. By the time we reached<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the cathedral after countless</p>
<p>roundabouts, whose small red and white triangular signs said, “Cede<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the passage”<br />
or “You do not have priority,” it was dark. We walked the nave. I pointed</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to the now black<br />
mosaics of stained glass, tried to describe for my wife and two daughters,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;who had never seen them,</p>
<p>the haloed apostles. I failed, stood silent under extinguished<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;windows in the dim<br />
half-light of the south ambulatory, and had to imagine</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>La Belle Verrière</em>,<br />
the blue mother holding her rust-robed child while gold censers swung<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;incense over</p>
<p>their heads and angels bore white candles to light their winding<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;way. The dark<br />
glass illumined the boredoms and terrors of 12th-century</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;French peasants.<br />
Somewhere in the central window of the west façade, a mother lay bleeding<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;on a gold fourposter.</p>
<p>Joseph dozed on a chair. Their newborn cried himself beet-red,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;finally slept, watched over<br />
by a drooling ox. I remembered how once Dana and I</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;came down with flu<br />
simultaneously and lay in bed, sitting up only to vomit into mixing<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bowls, while our six-month-old</p>
<p>daughter Eleanor howled in her crib for milk. We were too sick to feed her.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I still discover scrap paper,<br />
stuck in old books, with long lists in Dana’s hand, “Right 2:40,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;left 5:05,” in red pen<br />
to help her keep track of which breast Eleanor, who’s now 19,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;had nursed last.</p>
<p>Right breast, left breast, her mother weaned her. I couldn’t find<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the window in which Christ,<br />
tied to a post, got beaten by two men, one with a cricket bat,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the other with a flail shaped<br />
like a broom. At 16 Eleanor had walked with the handsome stranger<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to his top-floor apartment where</p>
<p>he tried to rape her. She ran down 20 flights of stairs. In the starless<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charlemagne window,<br />
Roland pierced the black giant Ferragut with a silver sword</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;through his navel,<br />
the only vulnerable spot on Irongut’s body. To the left of the altar my father<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;hung crucified on Alzheimer’s</p>
<p>cross. My mother and I took him down from that tree, washed his wounds,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;perfumed his body,<br />
stuffed a stone in the open mouth of his grave. For nine centuries Charlemagne</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;had gazed at the Milky Way,<br />
cornucopia of God’s coronation jewels, and tried to read there<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;his fate or fortune</p>
<p>in the next day’s battle. I could not see how the three butchers hacked<br />
at legs of lamb<br />
on a long table. Or how two bakers carried a man-sized wicker basket</p>
<p>of round loaves<br />
hung on a pole they shouldered. The loaves looked like cobblestones.<br />
I was condemned to eat them</p>
<p>and shit blood. On our journey from Provence, my internal hemorrhoids<br />
had ruptured,<br />
turned the water in the toilet bowl—no getting around it—</p>
<p>the same unearthly red<br />
as the stained glass of Chartres, sunset or sunrise, cumulus<br />
clouds of blood</p>
<p>I flushed. Rose windows, because you showed me in the dead of winter<br />
how my small life<br />
shone through your blacked-out panes forty feet above me, I knelt</p>
<p>down in that empty<br />
cathedral. I kissed the old worn stones we walked on. Nothing<br />
could have been colder.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/04/boots.audio-1.mp3">Facsimile in Boots</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There she is. A paper doll of me. The dress, the lilt, the self-hatred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd thins and swells in want of a scene. Conversations begin, pretend, then halt. My gin and tonic sweats into my hand and I lick at the moisture. Brows furrow with tension. I listen to leaves fall in a forest far from here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handsomely, he steers her around the room. The way he puts his arm around her, tries to fold her into approval, I measure his devotion. I know the weight of that hand, the shape of the fingers. The deep crevices. The cold it carries. It traveled my pale shoulder, my hand, the small of my back. It traveled me first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My arm twitches a little, homesick for that touch. I’ve never known a crowded room to be so empty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way she leans into his hand, the click of her boots against the floor, I measure the depth of his love. Her boots are a worn shade of black, shining buckles glint like razorblades, sutures of laces along the side. A deep chocolate, mine are higher heeled and sharper toed. Zippered with knowledge. She steps deliberately, with an ease I wish weren’t there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hasn’t gotten to her. Yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the words he whispers to her in the dead of night. When no one else is there to hear, I do. I know the heat of his breath, how the words warm with innovation. I know too, they’ll leave her alone and misshapen. The way he folds and creases us, bends and shapes us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are napkins into swans, paper into flowers, two into one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talk, she and I, in the corner, under a blanket of watchful, nervous eyes. We gush, anxious to dance around any acknowledgement of him. Her mouth is larger, thoughts smaller.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is perfecting this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has she seen the jelly jar beneath his bed? I don’t ask. Has he shown her how he bottles his love? I can not tell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight loves so far. Eight souvenirs. From eight paper people. Sameness swimming in a pink pickling solution. Not unlike the jar of olives in the kitchen. Not unlike those at roadside stations fat with briny eggs. Knotted pig knuckles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, she’s seen the knives. Used them to cut fruit for breakfast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the way he will lay her down, wear her down, hold her down as he finally declares his love for her. She’ll close her eyes, lean her head back, each limb a moccasin against a writhing other, until she doesn’t know her body from his. She won’t feel the slice. Not at first. He loves her. Confusion will come at the sight of sheets soaking red. But he loves her so. When the pain arrives, she’ll bear it, she’ll marry it, she’ll try to become worthy of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A part missing becomes such a small thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She’ll make nine. Just one away from a perfect ten.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing else between us, she says she likes my boots. I smile, knowing time will be marked from the day of severance. She’ll believe the relationship is a thing to cleave.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I reach out. Touch the soft of her arm. Affirm how lucky she is before I hobble on. My boot hardly pinches—not anymore—the place my toe used to be.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Young and Tender<br />
Zephyr Summer Squash Only $1.25 Per Lb.!”<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;says the sign</p>
<p>at the farmers’ market. Each one is a light-skinned zucchini<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;dipped halfway down<br />
into a vat of bright yellow wax and then pulled out. I fill</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a plastic bag<br />
with these hybrid vegetables, take them home to Dana, who pours<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;them into a white</p>
<p>bowl, weighs one in her palm, and exclaims, “How beautiful!<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They look like<br />
incredibly innocent dicks!” She always blurts out whatever</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;comes to mind.<br />
“Remember,” I ask her, “our first date at the Mine Shaft before<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;they changed its name</p>
<p>to Zanzibar’s?” Years later it became the Silver Fox. “We danced until<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;last call to the Neville Brothers.”<br />
When Aaron sang “Amazing Grace” a cappella in his wavering</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;whisper tenor, everyone<br />
stopped dancing and listened. “I remember when the Neville Brothers<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;were the Meters</p>
<p>and played Tipitina’s in the French Quarter,” replies Dana.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I hung out<br />
with Kurt Kasson &#038; the Wheeler Sisters. They all lived together</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;at the corner of Desire<br />
and Claiborne, but the band broke up. Joey sang such sassy scat!”<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An investment banker now</p>
<p>for Smith Barney, Jo Ellen uses that velvet voice<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;on the telephone<br />
to reassure her clients when their stocks go south.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She lent us<br />
her New York City apartment for two nights on our honeymoon.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had all her shoes</p>
<p>lined up, shelf after shelf in the walk-in closet—purple pumps,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;blue high heels, orange sandals,<br />
calf-length, white leather boots. I counted 77 pairs, which meant</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;that she could wear<br />
each one four to five times a year. They’d never wear out.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our honeymoon</p>
<p>was 22 years ago. Dana’s rheumatoid arthritis makes<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;her joints ache<br />
when it turns cold. Her bones are our barometer. We are no longer</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;young and tender<br />
zephyr summer squash. We listen to an old bootleg CD. Joey’s<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;high scatting harmonizes</p>
<p>with Lisa’s low silver notes on “What a Little Moonlight<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Can Do.”<br />
In 1973, everyone was 19 or 20. Whither with the summer</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;zephyr do we<br />
zither? Late August’s full moon rises—golden zero on the night’s<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;black balance sheet.</p>

<p>1. Descendancy</p>
<p>Work: sowing what we could in a bog-seam<br />
until the lumper failed us, the horse potato,</p>
<p>the patron saint of butter. We couldn’t pay.<br />
Without a handle on our hunger, heather lay</p>
<p>crudely over the land. We did what we could.<br />
Now we curse the bailiff’s turf and around</p>
<p>our cottage bank a fair fire. So what if our<br />
muscles spindle to thread? Bear witness.</p>
<p>Watch while our nets split from witchery<br />
and crops bleed frost on a plank of dew.</p>
<p>Your name will be honored as ours are:<br />
forgotten. The cottage will kneel to scalpeen</p>
<p>and burn the grass around, scorched reeds,<br />
mustard needled to flame and crested soot.</p>
<p>You’re our roots and heat. We’re your cuttings<br />
stashed in a pocket. The air flexes</p>
<p>through old stone, dampened vine and stem.<br />
The walls un-vetch and chimney flies naked.</p>
<p>If our people can’t have it, nobody will—<br />
this ink surviving, an X on onionskin paper.</p>
<p>2. St. Brigid</p>
<p>She was a poor girl minding her cow<br />
and had no place to feed it but the roadside.</p>
<p>Then a rich man who owned the land<br />
came by and in a fit of pity said,<br />
“How much land would it take to give grass to the cow?”</p>
<p>“As much as my cloak will cover,”<br />
she answered, and the man said, “I will give that.”</p>
<p>She laid down her cloak then, and it spread<br />
out miles on every side, wool unfolding<br />
shadows of fields, the hills like warmth rushing in.</p>
<p>But soon a silly old woman came by<br />
and stopped and said, “If your cloak goes on<br />
spreading, our whole island will be free,”</p>
<p>and with that the cloak stopped and spread no more.</p>
<p>3. Groomers</p>
<p>Tumbling from sky the buzzards<br />
sweep fetchless, legs rearing out<br />
and down as they land. Their knived faces,<br />
voices claw-like: Hark, what goes here?<br />
You wouldn’t think it<br />
but each has its own character:<br />
Bald Bitch, The Warden, The Pillar of Pall.<br />
They’re studied. You’ll never touch<br />
the artifice of their masks<br />
or smell their breath, like rot.<br />
Before approaching, they talk,<br />
settling things. It’s a privilege, really,<br />
the company of their flock.<br />
One of them flicks your hair, flaps back,<br />
then they rummage your clothes by the roadside.</p>
<p>4. Daunt’s Rock</p>
<p>From this dark, salted deck<br />
creaking the sinews of its beams<br />
I wish I could swim to your barnacled back,<br />
pull hand-over-hand<br />
drenched in my woolen pluck.<br />
My legs trailing seaweed<br />
and shoulders tied with twine.<br />
I’d suffer your weather and little games.<br />
As if there were such thing as anchor.</p>
<p>5. Their Ship Near Its Longing</p>
<p>Home was an island moored to an empire.<br />
Home was a blister of blood in the yolk.<br />
Home was the storm that broke the mast<br />
when nobody warned the colleens.</p>
<p>Home was a biscuit wrapped in a kerchief.<br />
Home was a kerchief draped on a face.<br />
One way, launched from the harbor at Cobh<br />
as they keened the magpie’s gray.</p>
<p>Home was beyond the valleys of sea,<br />
a drink for the picker, a drink for the drum.<br />
Home was a prospect, those last few waves<br />
toward the shuttles of Lowell’s looms.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Reprinted from Shenandoah Vol. 57, No. 2</em></p>
<p>No matter how much anyone wants to hear about it, I’m not going to discuss the night in Bill Dunlap’s Memphis studio when we started shooting at a panoramic photocollage of Mississippi hogs with a blowgun presented to Bill by Jim Dickey. Neither am I going to explain how we matriculated from a fried shrimp dive to a barbecue emporium and thence to the roof of a tall and gutted building where we were more vulnerable to both vertigo and the pelting rain than we had been on the neon-reflecting streets below, because if such a narrative is to unfold someday, it should be conveyed with troubling juxtapositions, high and low wit and rattling implications on rag paper or canvas with oils and the other materials that have served Mississippi’s grand chronicler, raconteur and art crusader Br’er Dunlap so well over the last three or four decades.</p>
<p>Bill was born in Houston, Mississippi in 1944, and so far as I can tell, he’s been reborn every day since. As he puts it, “I generally wake up of a morning thinking myself a painter and spend the balance of the day in my studio trying to prove it.” He’s been conjuring and executing his work in his native Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, northern Virginia and Florida at a blistering pace ever since, and I’ve succumbed to the evidence so long ago that anyone currently seeking an objective or restrained perspective on this matter need read no further.</p>
<p>Bill’s southern roots have provided his primary subject, though he’s branched out, as our cover suggests to blend the local and the global, the historical and the personal, the ironic and the romantic. If, as William Faulkner said, the past is not past, then the dead are not dead and the future is not only before us but with us. All of which I believe, else “grits ain’t groceries, eggs ain’t poultry and the Mona Lisa is a man,” as Titus Turner wrote it, Little Milton sang it and Bill would surely know it . In Dunlap’s paintings his own ancestors, Rembrandt, long-buried dogs, collapsed barns, fence lines, wild flora and fauna and a host of iconic artifacts take on a new life and speak to us. I don’t mean just me. His work has appeared in Harper’s, Esquire, Ontario Review, Vanity Fair, The Washington Post, arty magazines, dozens of museums, universities and galleries and on three previous covers of Shenandoah. Why? Because it is beautiful, witty, accessible, hungry, curious, ironic, beguiling, surprising and a little bit twisted. Because he summons so many beloved images, then subverts and scrambles them with counter-images and says Behold in a way that delights and threatens at the same time. “Hypothetical realism” he calls it in his high-octane honeyed bourbon voice. Inviting viewers to enjoy &#8212; as well as watch, wait, listen and think &#8212; he boldly approaches the comforting lure of nostalgia but swerves, winks and reminds viewers of the snelled hooks such delicious lures conceal. His beautiful Mississippi of the past, the old Shenandoah Valley and ridge farms of the Blue Ridge are all at once spellbinding and imbued with an awareness Flannery O’Connor expresses in Wise Blood:</p>
<p>Where you come from is gone; where you thought you were</p>
<p>going to never was there, and where you are is no good unless</p>
<p>you can get away from it.</p>
<p>But he also knows that the opposite is most likely equally true. And yet, he joyfully engages with both change and the resistance to it and is, in addition to being a disciplined and rigorous artist, an activist, archivist and grand panjandrum mischiefist who both celebrates and subverts the ceremonies and failures of his region, his country and his species (not limited to his fellow expatriates from the planet Mississippi). He can be found on panels, TV shows, openings, installations, classrooms, pig pickings and turkey shoots pushing art, praising art, interrogating art, all with a generosity of spirit Julia Reed calls “benevolent meddling.” His tactics are, of course, representation, but also reflection, refraction and deflection, all manner of distortion and a brand of yarning that is, for all its magpie gatheration, still pretty distinctly his own. His motifs include Rembrandt portraits, battlefields, wild animals (living and dead), arrows, farmsteads with fences, hounds (sad, sly, soulful or scolded), fish (as in “my mother is a”), water (coming, going or staying) delectable irises and other flora, vast landscapes and skyscapes &#8212; all charged and charmed by context and ingenious rendering. And colors? His purples are from Tyre, his blues from Robert Johnson, his yellows from Kashmiri saffron, and his browns, roans, buffs and ochers are out of the rich and riddling earth, his reds aortal and pomegranate and barnfire. And for all the beauty of his palette, he is threatening. Things and places (he is a priest of place) are vulnerable and under dangerous scrutiny, and we love them at our peril. Relics of the dead and sites of slaughter appear in juxtaposition to the most lulling viewsheds, and images of St. Sebastian and skulls crop up at the most inconvenient times. Ghosts wander about and beckon, but they do not simply disperse when we try to reason with them. Reversing the Hamlet practice, they interrogate us. As Barry Hannah has written, “Dunlap . . . put the hard-edge to the spooky and ineffable.”</p>
<p>And his canvases are big, and bigger. There’s an old back-yonder Delta tale about a marvelous, much-mourned dog. Seems a prideful countryman named Ratliff had only to step out on the porch holding up a plank the size of the raccoon whose meat he’d like in his kettle and skin he’d like stretched on the wall of his shed. Ratliff’s faithful hound Buster would take one look at the displayed plank and rush off, returning directly with a coon to fit the order. Unfortunately, one day Mr. Ratliff (or maybe it was Snopes or Gupton) had occasion to remove a broken door from its hinges, and he hauled it out onto the porch, where he was observed by a somewhat abashed Buster. The dog canted his head, sighed, whimpered and loped off toward the woods. Night fell, sun rose, stars again &#8212; no dog. Buster was never seen again. Dunlap, however, starts with the door-sized canvas (or paper, which he often paints, drops, smears and scumbles on) and expands from there. At least, that’s how I think he might make this point about scale and, maybe, ambition.</p>
<p>Early on, still hovering near the homeplace, Wild Bill demonstrated that he could offer up his own convincing version of the soul-razoring gaze of a Rembrandt self-portrait, rendering it with creepy accuracy, while interrogating product, process and the Master who produced it by hounding it or locating it at the center of a family reunion. He also painted his own family and environs with both deep fondness and a dead-serious irony, even then asking viewers to consider the cost of what we have and what we must lose in order to keep what we can’t bear to surrender. His 93 ½” long “Three Deer Head for Antietam” from 1982 presents a modern-day view of the battlefield site in winter, the upper two feet of the oil going from purple storm sky to burned butter to the thin rim of mountains, then hills, trees, nestled homes with one lonely martial monument, the whole vast marvel protecting both civilization and the profusion of the glorious from the foreground by only a frail fence, half toppled by the weight of snow (via <a href="http://www.dresshead.com/dresshead-staff-profile-joann-whiteside" style="text-decoration: none;color: #333">Joann</a> at <a href="http://dresshead.com" style="text-decoration: none;color: #333">http://www.dresshead.com</a>). What that foreground, the near hill, reveals are the disembodied heads of a trio of multi-branched mule bucks, their muzzles pointing toward the enticing viewshed, their severed necks showing gruesome meat and cartilage pointed right at the spectator. But you can’t just spectate, because these three sacrificed creatures with their thorny racks say, among other things, “Golgotha” and “suffering” and “cost.” And they ain’t whispering.</p>
<p>In 1984 when he painted one manifestation of his trademark horizontal intoxicating landscape with bristling, Luminist Revival light, stark trees, isolated farmstead in snow, migrating birds in the distance and misbehaving hunting dogs in the foreground, he called it “Agrarian Industrial Complex” and added a nuclear power plant emitting its gorgeous murderous smoke. No wonder the birds are leaving; no wonder three of the four dogs are looking out into the gallery to ask, “What do we do now?” while the fourth dog seeks a place to disappear.</p>
<p>Do now? Bill always seems to know, at least in some provisional way. He knows the bridge to take to the next thing, in various idioms, including conversation. I recollect one night when I was visiting him at his McLean studio, and we had sat up too late for safety naming the beasts of the forest and discussing how Miles Davis’s “Sketches of Spain” altered our auditory and visual imaginations forever. Though I’ve been a jackleg drummer off and on throughout my love affair with music, Bill was once the percussionist for Bill Whitsett’s Imperial Show Band and earned actual federal money at it. Seeing my experience, through no fault of his, as decidedly small change, I changed lanes and mentioned that I had some fine tomatoes in my garden, to which he replied that we should go to bed before the sun caught us, and we could greet the day joyously over some cathead biscuits and tomato gravy conjured from Mama Dunlap’s finest breakfast recipe. He was right about the need to sleep, and right about the biscuits slathered in gravy the hue of rosy-fingered dawn.</p>
<p>But sleep doesn’t seem to be one of his highest priorities, as Bill appears to be on the road or in the studio more hours per day than Timex puts on watches . It’s hard, looking at the proliferation of his oeuvre, not to think of the 18th century portraitist and polymath William Dunlap, who knew everything about the conventions of theater and not a little about paint. Though Willie Boy is more influenced by Church, Heade, Hopper, W. Homer, Rauschenberg, Wyeth and a heap of others than by the earlier Wm. (Roy Blount, Jr. says he “is to dog-trot what Cezanne was to the orange”), he knows as well as that long-gone W.D. that art is an event and life, as they used to say down at the Hollow Log Lounge, is an emergency.</p>
<p>An observer and commentator equally at home with Have Mercy in Darlington, S.C. and having coffee with maestro Gore Vidal on his piazza in Ravello, Dunlap is indeed “regional,” but not in the sense of gossip or local wines that won’t travel so much as in the sense of Islay scotch or scripture that are so specific as to be essential and must be allowed to stray where they may and will find advocates wherever they arrive and pause. Although a few titles of his paintings won’t make you cock your ears or raise your hackles &#8212; say “Objects Found and Fashioned,” “Landscape and Variable,” “Birds of a Feather,” “Mississippi Painting” &#8212; others say “enter at your own risk”: “Vitruvian Bear,” “Three Deer Head for Antietam,” “Rose Red Root Rut Run,” “He’ll Set Your Fields Afire,” “Delta Dog Trot, Landscape Askew”; “Rembrandt and Spook, Narcissus Reflects on the Starnes House as Audubon’s Osprey Flies Away.” How can anybody resist thinking, “I’d like to have a chance to look at those”?</p>
<p>ONE DAY THE mailman brought me a cardboard tube of the sort posters are shipped in, but I could hear something rattling inside as I tipped it, and the return address let me know it would be some sort of art. Inside, I found a hand-made arrow &#8212; fletched, nocked, paint-banded and chert-tipped with a hide strip lashing the point. “What on earth?” Today I might think some terrorist had turned strange, but then I just thought: “We’ll see.” The next paintings I saw by Bill featured various versions of an arrow-riddled corpse. Some would think of the body Costner/Dunbar and his mule driver in “Dances with Wolves” find on the prairie, as the teamster says somebody back home’s wondering, “Why don’t he write?” Others will envision Saint Sebastian, and a few (I wasn’t one yet) might say something akin to, “Aha, Sergeant Wylliams, a photo-documented casualty of manifest destiny’s miscalculations.” Bill means “all of the above,” and some version of that sad human pincushion appears in works like “Willing Spirit, Weak Flesh,” “Meditations on the Origins of Agriculture in America,” “Deer Hide Willow Seek,” “Indian Paint Brush” and others. Bill has written that the picture of the dead soldier remains “the most indelible image” for him, and as I perused these paintings and constructions, all the while that little “look out!” voice in my head was saying “and blowgun darts, too.”</p>
<p>Percussionist and projectile, evangelist (his step-daddy was called) and shill, pilgrim and curator &#8212; Dunlap believes in full immersion in both illusion and indelible, undeniable fact, and among the great messages in his work are that still life is not nature mort so much as a haunted pause in the wrestling match between refreshment and decay, that the South (with its high theater, low cunning and Christ-hauntedness) is a beautiful, dangerous place to live out the human experiment, that “good hand, good eye” is not enough or beside the point: technique is the mule, not the freight (but it is the mule!). And those dogs who seem to be looking for something (perhaps an earlier cannier race of master/comrades than we have proved to be) won’t let me forget Bill’s humor, which can be deft or sledge-hammer, as he’s not only witty in a traveled, astute and cunning way, but also hunker-down, knee-slap funny, full of puns &#8212; visual and verbal &#8212; exaggerations, wild associations and the sense that “anachronism” is just another way to say “anything goes.”</p>
<p>IN THE NEWER paintings (“Bull Barn Storm” and “What Boys Paint”) Dunlap revives and levitates some vintage warplanes to fly over Americana, then conducts both obsolete and state-of-the-art martial paraphernalia, complete with infantrymen, in a symphonic conflagration in which more goes on than barnstorming: explosions bloom in demonic shapes, a palm-studded country suffers and anonymous foot soldiers puzzle over gigantic saurian rough beasts slouching across the desert. Are these Iraqi crocs or our own Everglades gators, drafted for some new surge strategy? Maybe it doesn’t matter. In this painting not quite so long as a coffin, we feel shadows of the military cycloramas of Atlanta and Gettysburg (and the Depression mural revival) Dunlap has long admired and studied. This much we know: SOMEBODY is bringing the recent history of western military prowess to bear, with extreme prejudice, on a city and its surround. Spectators get to see the destruction from a protected distance, and the blood is hidden from us, but we know what colors these “boys” paint in, and who supplies the pigment by pints and gouts. Even the birds we have savored in previous Dunlap “productions” (the narrative is often so John-Ford cinematic that the word seems apt) signal that this crucible is, at best, a place to be from. Given the content of the daily news, his imagery here is hardly prophetic, but it is a grande pathetique, bringing some of the horror home, just in case anyone has forgotten the early months when vengeful might seemed to some enthusiasts beautiful in a para-testeronic way. Those gung-ho’s probably won’t like the ways he’s suggested their Great Adventure is, at best, opera buffo, but from the start “Shock and Awe” is a phrase born to describe a disaster, no matter how much glamour is mustered.</p>
<p>BROTHER DAVE GARDNER observed, upon seeing one of those road construction signs warning BE PREPARED TO STOP: If you wasn’t prepared to stop, dear hearts, you ought not to of started out. So I’m going to have to hit the brakes myself, though readers needn’t. What we offer in our portfolio is but a smattering of the blessed madness, but I want everyone to know that there’s more, much more.

<p>Christian Wiman’s exploration of grief and faith in <em>Every Riven Thing</em>, his third poetry collection, will not satisfy readers expecting either easy access or a sense of closure.  The literary and thematic connections with Wiman’s first two collections, <em>The Long Home</em> (Story Line Press, 1998, and Copper Canyon Press, 2007) and <em>Hard Night</em> (Copper Canyon Press, 2005), are apparent enough, but Wiman’s demand in his latest volume for the reader’s sustained attention is a departure from the more modest requirements of the poet’s earlier work.  The effort required by these poems is not always rewarded, but careful and patient readers will find much of the work ultimately satisfying.</p>
<p>No one will ever confuse Wiman with Billy Collins.  There are no dogs conducting orchestras here, no swirls into epiphany.  The poet’s focus is so concentrated and serious that the slightest deviations announce themselves.  At times, one senses a convert’s tendency to take everything – himself included – too seriously.  Even the book’s design suggests solemnity:  the faint cover image of a face emerging beneath the gothic font of the title; the white, gothic numerals on the otherwise solid black pages marking the volume’s three sections.  The effect is slightly disturbing; the impression is one of something foreboding, dangerous, even medieval.</p>
<p>Wiman’s prose offers one framework for considering <em>Every Riven Thing</em>.  As dangerous as it is to read biography into poems, in this instance the connection is unmistakable and the urge irresistible.  In his 2006 essay “Love Bade Me Welcome,” Wiman discloses that he has been diagnosed with an incurable cancer of the blood.  He also recalls a story told by Simone Weil, his spiritual mentor, in which two prisoners in adjoining cells learn over time to communicate by tapping and scratching on the dividing wall.  The wall both separates, and provides the only connection between, the prisoners.  In <em>Every Riven Thing</em>, the poet explores disease, grief and faith in three sections that move from the speaker’s anguished acceptance of his circumstance of disease, through an interlude of despair, to a focused theological framing of his condition.</p>
<p>Wiman’s facility with form is on display in the collection’s first section.  From the five rhymed couplets of “To Grasp at the Mercury Minnows Are” to the sixty-two lines in “Sitting Down to Breakfast Alone,” the section thrives on formal variety.  Even for a poet as formally dexterous as Wiman, though, the reach demanded by rhyme sometimes exceeds the poet’s grasp.  In “Sitting Down to Breakfast Alone,” the speaker describes a waitress and a scene in a small-town diner</p>
<p>where even the oldest in the old men’s booth<br />
swore as if it were scripture truth<br />
they’d never had a breakfast better,<br />
rapping a glass sharply to get her<br />
attention when it went sorrowing<br />
so far into some simple thing . . . .</p>
<p>More troubling, however – and indicative of these poems – is the poet’s unwillingness to provide emotional access points to the reader.  The poems are neither obscure nor overly difficult.  Notwithstanding the logical coherence, however, readers will leave many of the poems with little sense of connection to the speaker.  Here is “To Grasp at the Mercury Minnows Are” in its entirety:</p>
<p>To grasp at the mercury minnows are<br />
or were<br />
in childhood’s kingdom<br />
lord of boredom<br />
is to see<br />
through an intimate, ultimate clarity<br />
that galaxy shatter<br />
and like a mind of matter<br />
resolve itself star by slow star.<br />
To grasp at the mercury minnows are . . .</p>
<p>Concepts – “ultimate clarity,” “lord of boredom,” “childhood’s kingdom,” “mind of matter” – overpower the poem.</p>
<p>“Five Houses Down” is the most aesthetically satisfying poem in the first section, precisely because it grounds the reader in a place with identifiable characters and believable details without sacrificing the music of the lines and displays a rare touch of humor:</p>
<p>I loved his ten demented chickens<br />
and the hell-eyed dog, the mailbox<br />
shaped like a huge green gun.<br />
I loved the eyesore opulence<br />
of his five partial cars, the wonder-cluttered porch<br />
with its oilspill plumage, tools<br />
cauled in oil, the dark<br />
clockwork of disassembled engines<br />
christened Sweet Baby and benedicted Old Bitch . . . .</p>
<p>Yet, “Five Houses Down” does not belong, thematically or tonally, in the book.</p>
<p>Wiman establishes the tone of the volume’s first section in “After the Diagnosis,” “The Mole” and “Darkcharms.”  Their titles, alone, evoke sickness and dis-ease.  In the title poem, Wiman emphasizes the broken nature of human existence.  He repeats the first line, “God goes, belonging to every riven thing he’s made,” at the beginning of each stanza and again in a closing line.  Using form to advance content, the poet moves the caesura in each of the repeated lines, thereby disrupting their rhythm in different ways, until the final repetition in a complete declarative sentence that suggests both God’s disruptive role and God’s absence.</p>
<p>The most representative poem in the first section, however, is “This Mind of Dying,” a formal jewel capturing the tone of the book’s first two sections and anticipating the third by taking the form of a prayer of supplication directed to the speaker’s God, whom the speaker identifies with grief.  Unfortunately, the poem also reflects the collection’s tendency to conceptualize, rather than concretize:</p>
<p>My God my grief forgive my grief tamed in language<br />
to a fear that I can bear.<br />
Make of my anguish<br />
more than I can make.  Lord, hear my prayer.</p>
<p>The poem is a prayer of lament; it could have been written by the psalmist.</p>
<p>The second section of the volume is the least satisfying.  The first three poems – “Voice of One Head,” “Country in Search of a Symbol” and “The Wind Is One Force” – are unmistakably political and introduce a note of cultural criticism that makes only one more brief appearance near the end of section two in the seven named sections of “Not Altogether Gone,” a poem whose tone may be discerned from two of the section titles:  “Fuck Dominoes” and “Like a Dog Existence Is.”  The only rationale for including “Do You Remember the Rude Nudists” in the collection at all may be its introduction of the speaker’s lover, but the book does not need it.</p>
<p>More on point are the section’s final two poems, “A Good Landscape for Grief” and “Jouissance.”  The latter poem reinforces explicitly what the speaker has hinted in the preceding poems—the speaker struggles with inhabiting any sense of joy.  “A Good Landscape for Grief,” the penultimate poem in the second section, provides the clearest transition into the final section of the book.  It also contains some of the flaws that detract from the collection’s power.  In this poem, Wiman describes a “good landscape for grief” as an arid one.  In a striking, perhaps original, contrast, he compares the dry environment of grief with the saturated nature of depression:</p>
<p>Depression is a wet word, with ripe vines,<br />
claustrophobic moss, endless dripping<br />
instants which here have no more<br />
purchase on the earth<br />
than a tear from an armadillo’s eye.</p>
<p>The final image—that tear—is a strange one, but it chimes with the “here” in the third quoted line to locate the speaker unmistakably in the landscape of grief.  The poem’s close examination of the parched landscape of grief and the dripping enclosure of depression is masterful; however, Wiman diminishes the power of the contrast by confusing the speaker’s voice.  In line thirteen, Wiman employs the impersonal third-person singular when he writes of “one’s own maudlin drama.”  In line five and elsewhere, the speaker uses the second-person direct address or, alternatively, the reflexive “you.”  In the long comparison comprising lines sixteen through thirty-eight, Wiman dares the reader to figure it out:</p>
<p>We are gathered here to mark one man<br />
passing.  He is your father<br />
and your son, my mother and my self.<br />
Let us sing this city of instants<br />
come back to be a part of us.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the confusion in voice, however, the poem places the speaker firmly in the terrain of grief, and that is the essential setting for the third, and most rewarding, section of the book.</p>
<p>The last fourteen poems in the volume are theological.  Prayer is the dominant mode; but, these poems are not prayers of devotion to a divinity with whom the speaker is in close relationship.  These are prayers of the psalmist insisting to be heard, who desires understanding of suffering’s genesis, and who acknowledges the ambiguity and ultimate mystery of the divine’s simultaneous presence and absence.</p>
<p>Although the prayerful tone of these final poems is filtered through a screen of lament, in both form and image these poems respond to the earlier poems of grief—poems of a certain kind of wilderness.  Considered as a group, the poems in this section are tighter metrically, and their stanzaic structures far more regular, than the poems in the first two sections.  They look and sound more solid.</p>
<p>The language of faith occurs early and often in the third section.  Wiman’s repetition of images to unify the collection, a device used to lesser effect in “Jouissance” and “It Takes Particular Clicks,” is particularly notable in the religious imagery found in “And I Said to My Soul, Be Loud.”  Following the wonderful description of his life as a “war in a jar,” the speaker exclaims</p>
<p>For I am come a whirlwind of wasted things<br />
and I will ride this tantrum back to God<br />
until my fixed self, my fluorescent self<br />
my grief-nibbling, unbewildered, wall-to-wall self<br />
withers in me like a salted slug</p>
<p>The connection between wind and the divine is biblical.  In II Kings, the prophet Elijah is taken into heaven in a whirlwind, and the breath of God – the <em>ruah Yahweh</em> – is a powerful Old Testament symbol of God’s presence and power.  Wiman employs this symbol in no fewer than four poems but varies its application, from a vehicle to God to a tool of divine agency, even a malignant one.</p>
<p>Religious belief emerges unmistakably in this final section.  Prayer is the dominant theme (“Hammer Is the Prayer,” “Small Prayer in a Hard Wind,” “Lord Is Not a Word” and “Lord of Having”).  In “When the Time’s Toxins,”</p>
<p>somehow a seed<br />
of belief</p>
<p>sprouts the instant<br />
I acknowledge it . . . .</p>
<p>This belief, however, is not an immature embrace of easy answers.  In “I Sing Insomnia,” the speaker struggles with purpose, grappling with his existential situation and finding his footing, though not a resting place, in religious faith and love.  The collection closes with “Gone for the Day, She Is the Day,” questioning the role of the divine and suggesting human love as an appropriate posture from which to face suffering and mortality:</p>
<p>Sometimes one has the sense<br />
that to say the name<br />
God is a great betrayal,</p>
<p>but whether one is betraying<br />
God, language, or one’s self<br />
is harder to say.</p>
<p>It is easier to admire <em>Every Riven Thing </em>than it is to like it.  In too many of these poems, Wiman indulges his own philosophical curiosity at the expense of his readers’ ability to participate emotionally; yet, the resulting emotional distance does not feel malicious.  Rather, one leaves these poems with a vague sense of relief that someone else has voiced the anxiety and doubt that one has been too timid, or too afraid, to express.</p>

<div class="indented"><strong>THE JUNEBUGS</strong><br />
<em>Hey boy come here &#8212; quick,</em><br />
&nbsp; so he dropped his rake and<br />
ran to the yard by the housewhere probably five hundred<br />
&nbsp; junebugs like a pile of emeralds<br />
and rubies glistened crawlingover each other under each other<br />
&nbsp; in the grass. <em>By god look at them<br />
fornicating</em>, he said and his sonsaid <em>Hold on, I got an idea</em>, and ran<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; to the house for the bundle of<br />
twine and gunpowder he had tied</p>
<p>together into a bomb for such<br />
&nbsp; a purpose and blew an equally<br />
glittering hole in the yard</p>
<p>a foot into the earth and the punch<br />
&nbsp; his father landed reverberated<br />
in his skull for the rest of his life</p>
<p>and when the assassin fired<br />
&nbsp; it was the last thing he saw &#8212;<br />
junebugs everywhere crawling</p>
<p>glistening in the tall summer grass.</p>
<p><strong>THE PALACE</strong></p>
<p>Sarah knew how to cipher<br />
&nbsp; and added up for her brother<br />
his exact age when he asked.</p>
<p>Twelve years three months<br />
&nbsp; nineteen days.&nbsp; She gave him<br />
her cakes.&nbsp; She pulled the fang</p>
<p>of a corn snake from the side<br />
&nbsp; of his foot.&nbsp; She hugged up<br />
on him and said she loved him.</p>
<p>She could sew a pair of pants<br />
&nbsp; for the King of England if<br />
she was given the cloth and</p>
<p>he wanted most of all to acquire<br />
&nbsp; for her such cloth.&nbsp; She likes<br />
to follow she said the raw gold</p>
<p>of her thoughts.&nbsp; She kept a cricket<br />
&nbsp; in her pocket all one summer.<br />
When she talked it was like a palace.</p>
<p>Often he saw his mother waving<br />
&nbsp; from the tower and smiling<br />
he thought when his sister talked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>THE SPOON</strong></p>
<p>Seeing what he could<br />
&nbsp; but would not be &#8212;<br />
a blacksmith a cooper<br />
&nbsp; a tailor a woodsman<br />
a farmer, his father</p>
<p>bought a fancy spoon<br />
&nbsp; made of silver from<br />
a neighbor and gave it<br />
&nbsp; to his son who would<br />
only read and read</p>
<p>and talk of books and<br />
&nbsp; when the boy who was<br />
certainly now a man<br />
&nbsp; doomed to a life unlike<br />
enough to his father’s</p>
<p>that all was probably<br />
&nbsp; lost between them<br />
he tucked the spoon<br />
&nbsp; with a deep oval valley<br />
hammered very thin</p>
<p>and a rose embossed<br />
&nbsp; at the end of the handle<br />
into a worn copy of<br />
&nbsp; the poems of Horace<br />
before the boy left</p>
<p>for good &#8212; the gesture<br />
&nbsp; a lasting singular<br />
note of goodbye to<br />
&nbsp; one for whom he could<br />
never provide anything</p>
<p>so fine it would shine<br />
&nbsp; in the sun or feed him<br />
or keep him alive. Go,<br />
&nbsp; it said. Go, my son.<br />
Eat. Drink. And thrive.</p>
<p>July 1831</p>
<p><strong>THE LAW</strong></p>
<p>Unnoticed for over 600 years<br />
in the sky the 39th clause<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of the Magna Carta</p>
<p>in small letter-shaped clouds<br />
floated and faded as<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they were read aloud:</p>
<p>“To no one will we sell<br />
or deny or delay right<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or justice.” He wondered</p>
<p>at it all. In the orchard<br />
in May he saw a hive<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of bees spelling the whole</p>
<p>of the Declaration in the trees,<br />
the fat queen being the dot<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of the i where “We hold</p>
<p>these truths to be self evident.”<br />
He learned by reading<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; everything he saw: rivers</p>
<p>moving slowly in the winter<br />
toward a thaw &#8212; like gold<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in the straw. The myriad</p>
<p>faces of strangers. Waterfalls.<br />
Self taught, he read each<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; document as natural law.</p>
<p><strong>THE RITUAL</strong></p>
<p>As every president<br />
&nbsp; before him<br />
when he entered<br />
&nbsp; the office</p>
<p>he was presented<br />
&nbsp; a rosewood<br />
box the exact size<br />
&nbsp; of a gun case</p>
<p>and the steward<br />
&nbsp; unlocked<br />
the smart brass clasp<br />
&nbsp; with a key</p>
<p>elaborately cast<br />
&nbsp; with the head<br />
of a dragon and<br />
&nbsp; the velvet</p>
<p>was pulled away<br />
&nbsp; as the steward<br />
gestured for Lincoln<br />
&nbsp; to pick up</p>
<p>the pocked gray<br />
&nbsp; thigh bone<br />
of Achilles<br />
&nbsp; and to say</p>
<p>aloud: <em>We are one</em><br />
&nbsp; in the Greek<br />
and to turn around<br />
&nbsp; three times</p>
<p>and return the relic<br />
&nbsp; to its case<br />
and tell no one<br />
&nbsp; which was done.</p>
<p>March 1861</p>
<p><strong>THE BUCKET</strong></p>
<p>Shock at what he was. Shock<br />
&nbsp; at what he’d done. The man<br />
all day was numb after this &#8212;</p>
<p>the unmitigated disaster at<br />
&nbsp; Bull Run. The dead everywhere<br />
his own responsibility, the running</p>
<p>away a necessity for the Union<br />
&nbsp; because of his own amateur<br />
performance as a commander.</p>
<p>He went to the barn to talk<br />
&nbsp; to his horse, he took an empty<br />
feed bucket and placed it over</p>
<p>his head like a bell and sat there<br />
&nbsp; with his horse in the darkness<br />
of his failure. The next day</p>
<p>his aides brought fifty books<br />
&nbsp; from the Library of Congress<br />
and he read each one aloud</p>
<p>from Machiavelli to the Iliad<br />
&nbsp; to the journals of Julius Caesar<br />
and stabbed himself discreetly</p>
<p>marking an X on his chest<br />
&nbsp; to remember his shame bleeding<br />
into his sleeves. Never again</p>
<p>would he leave the fighting and<br />
&nbsp; the dying exclusively to brave men<br />
he thought I have murdered<br />
such as these.</p>
<p><strong>THE SHOVEL</strong></p>
<p>Klong klong klong<br />
&nbsp; he remembers<br />
his angel-mother</p>
<p>banging a shovel<br />
&nbsp; on the stone step<br />
of the cabin door</p>
<p>killing three snakes<br />
&nbsp; at once klong &#8212;<br />
one, klong &#8212; two,</p>
<p>klong &#8212; three &#8212; these<br />
&nbsp; alternating<br />
and precise swings</p>
<p>one for each landed<br />
&nbsp; very quickly<br />
like the percussive</p>
<p>force of the mortars<br />
&nbsp; across the river<br />
in Virginia, the snakes</p>
<p>coiling and uncoiling<br />
&nbsp; in agony<br />
toward death &#8212; this</p>
<p>familiar American<br />
&nbsp; song banging<br />
at his doorstep.</p>
<p><strong>THE PHOTOGRAPH</strong></p>
<p>Blasted with light for the portrait<br />
&nbsp; that will be engraved on the penny<br />
the lines of his face grow deeper</p>
<p>until he blinks and coughs a little<br />
&nbsp; and rubs his eyes afterward saying &#8212;<br />
<em>alright then now it is your turn</em> &#8212;</p>
<p>so the photographer sets the powder<br />
&nbsp; and readies the camera for the amateur<br />
who eyes him now through the lens</p>
<p>in the dark of the hood &#8212; <em>now be still<br />
&nbsp; sir and take your medicine</em>. Not wanting<br />
to return yet to the war, more sitters</p>
<p>are found for the president including<br />
&nbsp; a chimney sweep walking by and<br />
a girl in a <a href="http://www.dresshead.com/ultra-mini-dress-daisy-print-yellow/">yellow dress with a bow</a></p>
<p>and then the two of us &#8212; reluctant to<br />
&nbsp; say no. Tomorrow six horses burn<br />
in the stables of the White House and</p>
<p>the sound of their screams and the look<br />
&nbsp; in their eyes will stay in his mind for<br />
another year or so. In eight minutes</p>
<p>in Cold Harbor 26,000 men will be lost.<br />
&nbsp; This man is the cause. He looks at us<br />
appraisingly and then the flash goes off.</p>
<p><strong>THE CAKE</strong><br />
At the intersection of 12th street and New York<br />
&nbsp; Whitman carried a loaf of sourdough bread<br />
under his arm like a newspaper and stopped</p>
<p>short for coming the opposite direction without<br />
&nbsp; looking up was the actor John Booth practicing<br />
his lines from Macbeth concerning the murder</p>
<p>of the king for tonight’s capitol performance.<br />
&nbsp; And as the actor passed the star-struck poet<br />
on the street Abraham Lincoln crossed suddenly</p>
<p>toward them and briefly between them mumbling<br />
&nbsp; his pardon as he brushed past them returning<br />
the last red taffeta evening dress his wife would</p>
<p>ever buy with his money, the box like a five-tiered<br />
&nbsp; wedding cake obscuring him, so heavy and large<br />
it pitched a little in front of him as he carried it</p>
<p>precarious in his arms and passed between John Booth<br />
&nbsp; and the poet who both stopped together in the street<br />
amazed to see such a thing &#8212; a huge white box</p>
<p>with crimson roses and a vine printed around<br />
&nbsp; the side floating away and turning the day &#8212; the fine<br />
multitudinous sea of the day &#8212; suddenly incarnadine.</p>
<p>Aug 1864</p>

Still the tree’s petal-fall dusts us angelic,<br />
our arms feathered wings.</p>
<p>A fool’s errand, this search for meaning,<br />
metaphor the bed we lie and awaken in.<br />
Hey there, get off our cloud!</p>
<p>In this we grow lonely though not alone,<br />
the way my Cortland shimmers<br />
in a cloud of her own making.</p>
<p>I know what I said.  I said her.<br />
You’d like to know what I make<br />
of her secret, also ours.</p>
<p>Try this: forget the fate we’ll share,<br />
warm from the oven of our unmaking,<br />
soon these limbs winter bare.</p>
<p>Just don’t, let’s say,<br />
our arms petaled feathers.<br />
This once: Don’t think.</p>

Her short stories have been anthologized in <em>The Best American Short Stories 2008, 2009, </em><em>2010</em> and 2011 and have also appeared in <em>Ploughshares, Tin House, The Threepenny Review, </em>and <em>Shenandoah</em>. She earned a master’s degree from Middlebury College’s Bread Loaf School of English. Makkai graduated from Washington and Lee with a BA in English. During her time at W&amp;L, she served as a student assistant at <em>Shenandoah</em>.  Through this interview conducted via email, Makkai shares her thoughts on her time at W&amp;L, her writing discipline and practice, and the particulars of working in the publishing world. Providing insightful commentary on her career as a writer whose work is “pure invention,” Makkai teases out her imaginative process.</p>
<p><strong>Tracy Richardson:</strong> What was work-study like at <em>Shenandoah</em>? How was working under the direction and guidance of both R.T. Smith and Lynn Leech?</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca Makkai: </strong>In my sophomore year of college the stars magically aligned, and I got to spend the next three years working in literary heaven at the <em>Shenandoah</em> office. I opened mail, logged submissions, stuffed envelopes with rejection slips, alphabetized the enormous stash of literary magazines in the basement, and retyped the accepted stories that came in without a floppy disk (ah, the dark ages), and while those might sound like mundane tasks, to me they were anything but.</p>
<p>I’m glad that I understood at the time what an education it was, and I absorbed every detail I could. I’ve realized since then how mystified most writers are about what goes on at literary journals, and yet it’s a world that’s essential for poets and short story writers to feel comfortable in. Especially in the early days of sending stories out, I was so grateful for all that time spent sending out hundreds of rejections at a time; I knew better than to take things personally, and I knew the patience I’d need.</p>
<p><strong>TR: </strong>As an undergraduate, you published some pieces in the student magazine <em>Ariel </em>(now called <em>Muse</em>). What is your perspective on these pieces looking back now as a writer?</p>
<p><strong>RM: </strong>I can’t even remember what those were, but I fear I might have inflicted my poetry on people. I remember that the stories I wrote in college were much more concerned with voice than with plot, and for some reason I often wrote from a very limited point of view, narrating as a child or an idiot or a confused outsider. A few years after college, someone gave me the very liberating advice that it was okay to have a narrator as smart as – or smarter than – I am. I’m unclear on why that hadn’t occurred to me before, but I suspect it had something to do with reading (and gravely misunderstanding) a lot of Eudora Welty.</p>
<p><strong>TR:</strong> Which authors that you discovered at Washington and Lee remain favorites of yours today? Who are some of your favorite authors that you have found since graduating?</p>
<p><strong>RM:</strong> Almost everyone I read in college I was “discovering” for the first time, so the list is very long. One memory that stands out is of walking to campus across the bridge by the Lenfest Center, holding A. S. Byatt’s <em>Possession</em> open in front of me so I could read while I walked, and almost running into some poor woman and her Labrador.</p>
<p>I do love reading literature in translation now, and that’s something I only had time for after college. If I were designing an English department from scratch tomorrow, I’d require students to take at least one or two courses in foreign lit, if only so they didn’t end up with the impression that everything from the sonnet to modernism was invented by the Brits and Americans. It’s strange for me to think that twelve years ago, when I graduated, I’d never read Tolstoy or Calvino or Flaubert or Borges – though Borges might have fried my undergraduate brain, so perhaps it’s for the best that I waited on that one.</p>
<p><strong>TR: </strong>What did you do immediately after graduating from W&amp;L? What were your experiences like at graduate school? Were there many similarities (or differences) between your time at Middlebury and your time at W&amp;L?</p>
<p><strong>RM:</strong> I earned my Master’s in English from Middlebury College’s Bread Loaf School of English, which is a five-summer program on a beautiful mountain in the middle of nowhere. It’s an unusual program, in that there’s no Master’s thesis and that creative writing classes and even acting classes can count towards the degree. I had the luxury of studying poetry with Paul Muldoon and short fiction with David Huddle, but also got to push myself by taking a class blithely called “Joyce, Proust and Mann” from the frighteningly brilliant Michael Wood. It was a healthy balance, in keeping with the liberal arts education I’d just experienced in college.</p>
<p>Although it wasn’t a mandatory part of either program, I feel strongly that creative writing should be not just offered but <em>required</em> at some point for literature students, in order that they fully understand what it is they’re even studying. I can’t imagine an art or music major that didn’t require at least one studio class, and it’s odd that English has skewed so far to the “humanities” side of things that we forget it’s also a study of a fine art. Yet I don’t know of a single college or graduate lit program that requires a student to try writing a poem. (Another component of my imaginary English department… along with free Starbucks. I can dream.)</p>
<p><strong>TR: </strong>Recently, a creative writing minor was introduced at W&amp;L, a step that really seems to promote the emergence of young writers in the undergraduate setting. How did your time at Washington and Lee influence elements of your writing? How are writers who have come from Washington and Lee representatives of the Washington and Lee community?</p>
<p><strong>RM: </strong>I wonder if the number of workshops I took, combined with my creative honors thesis and my time at Shenandoah, would qualify now as a minor.  If I could have taken creative writing every semester of college, I would have; as it was, I took all the courses offered and then audited one of Dabney Stuart’s workshops that I’d already taken for credit.  Although I made great friends in the workshops, some of whom I’m still in touch with, I would have enjoyed the support of a cohesive and self-selected writing group that grew together through the four years.</p>
<p>Washington and Lee has a tremendous literary tradition (I steam every time my husband’s Yale alumni magazine claims Tom Wolfe as a product of New Haven), and I think there’s something magical about the campus and the scenery there that inspires people to write. It was one of the main reasons I chose the school – on my tour, I just got an overwhelming feeling of “this is a place where I could write.”</p>
<p><strong>TR: </strong>Are you familiar with other Washington and Lee alums who have had successful careers as writers?</p>
<p><strong>RM: </strong>When I was a student, people were still talking on campus about Lyrae Van Clief-Stefanon (’93), whose poetry I’ve watched for and enjoyed since then. And I have John Pipkin (89)’s novel <em>Woodsburner</em> sitting in my to-read pile.</p>
<p><strong>TR:</strong> What are some of your most <em>important</em> memories of W&amp;L?</p>
<p><strong>RM: </strong>In terms of my writing future, some of my more important experiences actually happened in the theater, both acting in shows and then studying playwriting with Tom Ziegler. I wasn’t a particularly talented actor, but I loved the theater and did something like six shows in my first two years, after which I decided I needed to sleep and pass my classes and gave it up. But that experience of living inside a story, day after day, thinking about character and plot and dialogue on a deeper level with every rehearsal, it definitely enhances your understanding of story.</p>
<p><strong>TR:</strong> Have you come back to campus since graduating?</p>
<p><strong>RM: </strong>I showed my husband the campus when we were dating, but not since then. I’d love to be able to get back there to do a student workshop someday.</p>
<p><strong>TR: </strong>What are some characteristics of your writing discipline and practice? Do you have any specific habits to assist you in the writing process?</p>
<p><strong>RM:</strong> I have a three-year-old and a six-month-old, so right now, getting out of the house is an essential part of the creative process, since I find it helpful not to be climbed on while writing.</p>
<p>I always start by rereading what I’ve already written, editing as I go, and by the time I get to the new part I’m already living in the world of the story, and I’m writing new paragraphs before I even realize it. Hemingway famously said that you should stop not when you’re stuck, but when you know exactly what you want to write the next time. I agree, but I’d add that if you’re a sleep-deprived mom, it’s also best to jot down a few notes about what exactly that is.</p>
<p><strong>TR:</strong> Do you have any advice for young writers? Are there any pieces of advice you can offer on craft or discipline?  How do you feel is the best way to shape a writing schedule? What are your thoughts on revision and editing?</p>
<p><strong>RM:</strong> My strongest advice for young fiction writers is to remember that above all, you’re telling a story. When you first start out, you can get so caught up in wanting to sound like a writer, and wanting to describe things beautifully, that you can forget no one is even going to listen to what you have to say unless you have a fascinating story to tell. Everything else – the schedule, the revisions, whatever rain dance you have to do before you sit down in your chair – is so individualized to the writer; but the story-telling part is essential and universal. And, weirdly, so easily neglected.</p>
<p><strong>TR:</strong> How is your image as a person similar to or different than what people think writers are like?</p>
<p><strong>RM:</strong> I think many people’s image of a writer is actually of a very introverted poet: someone quiet and dreamy, writing by hand in a creamy notebook. Like most of the fiction writers I know, I’m rather outgoing and gossipy, and I have a lot going on in my life besides writing.</p>
<p><strong>TR:</strong> For you, what has it meant to be a writer as your career? Have you discovered anything interesting, unappealing, or surprising about the business side of publishing?</p>
<p><strong>RM:</strong> Everyone I’ve met in the publishing world has been completely lovely, and I honestly didn’t expect that. I was imagining some snarky, literary version of the New York fashion industry (The Devil Reads Kafka?), but everyone I’ve met is just a wonderful book geek, and I don’t think they’d mind my calling them that. I’ve also been surprised by how female-dominated the industry is. I had the opportunity to meet my editor last summer in the Penguin building in New York, and the only man I saw the whole time was the guy who gave me my elevator pass.</p>
<p>Of course the publishing industry is in bad repair, and when I’m in a particularly bad mood I feel like I’ve finally been let on board a wonderful boat just when it’s about to sink. The optimistic view, though, is that I’m more wedded to the idea of storytelling than to the idea of a physical, hardcover book, and humans will always, always need storytellers because they will always need stories, whatever the delivery system. It’s hard to imagine a world where art fails just because a particular industry founders. If it ever comes down to it, just give me a microphone and I’ll stand in the park telling stories.</p>
<p><strong>TR:</strong> How did you find an agent or did an agent find you?</p>
<p><strong>RM: </strong>After my first appearance in <em>Best American Short Stories</em>, I started getting contacted by agents, but I wasn’t in any rush. I’d sent out a really horrible version of my novel to a few agents the year before, and had been lucky to get some pointed feedback along with my rejections. I knew that their criticisms were valid, and I knew the book wasn’t ready yet. I spent another year fixing it (actually abandoning it, starting another novel, returning to the first, fixing it, abandoning it, and so on) and decided that before I got back to any of those lovely agents who’d taken the time to write to me, I would take my chances on my dream agent, Nicole Aragi, who (as W&amp;L professor Jim Warren would put it) wouldn’t have known me if I stood up in her soup. Somehow, I got from her assistant’s inbox to hers, and she eventually took me on.</p>
<p>I remember, when I was working at <em>Shenandoah</em>, peeking at a cover letter where an MFA student had written that her professor advised her to start at the top and work her way down, and this was why she was starting with <em>Shenandoah</em>. I don’t believe her kiss-up worked, but it struck me as a decent piece of advice, and I was thinking of that when I put everyone else on hold to take my chances on Nicole.</p>
<p><strong>TR: </strong>In terms of advice to young writers, what are some words of wisdom regarding navigating the business aspects of the publishing world?</p>
<p><strong>RM:</strong> Wait.</p>
<p>What I mean is, there’s no race to be the youngest published writer out there, and I’ve seen a lot of writers try to skip over some crucial rites of passage because they’re so anxious to make a name for themselves. They usually end up disheartened and stuck. For most writers (but of course not all), it’s essential to master the short story before moving on to the novel, just as filmmakers will start with shorts. This isn’t because of anything intrinsic to the story form, but rather because completing many short pieces gives you the opportunity to stand back and look at the entirety of a finished work – one you didn’t spend years of your life on – and assess it as a whole. You can play with structure, rewrite the entire thing, or just chuck it, and that’s a lot harder to do with a novel.</p>
<p>At a recent reading, a young college student told me he was stressed about finding an agent. I was too taken aback even to ask what he’d written – and who knows, maybe he was a genius – but my guess was that he’d sat in his dorm room writing a novel, and then he’d heard somewhere that the next step was the agent. All I could think was, thank god I didn’t go around worrying about publishing when I was nineteen. It was wonderful to have that time to play around with my stories, never even considering a publisher or an audience, or whether my stories were good enough to land me a book deal. That would have been quite limiting, I think.</p>
<p><strong>TR: </strong>How has winning awards and critical acclaim affected your confidence? Your discipline?</p>
<p><strong>RM: </strong>After your first story is published, there’s a huge paradigm shift when you realize you’re actually writing for readers. Then there’s another one when you get to the point where people are actively seeking out your work, talking about it to each other online, waiting for your novel. That first revolution didn’t do much but make me more careful not to write about real people; the second has helped me to prioritize my writing, and not feel guilty about taking time away from my family to get out of the house and work. It would be very hard to justify that to myself if I didn’t know there were people out there caring that I wrote something.</p>
<p><strong>TR: </strong>What were some general readers’ responses to “The Briefcase?” Obviously the short story has received much praise from the literary community, but what types of feedback have you gotten from readers in general?</p>
<p><strong>RM:</strong> One very brave AP English student sent me his term paper, and I loved reading it and seeing the things he’d thought of that hadn’t occurred even to me, at least not on the conscious level. I told him it was like having my dream interpreted by a really sharp psychologist. Apparently it’s been assigned quite a bit in high school and college classes, and I’ve just given permission for its inclusion in a textbook. That’s a strange thing, to know that people are being forced to read your writing. For a while, one of the things that popped up on Google when you started typing my name was a search for “briefcase summary.” Of course no such thing exists – but it cracks me up that enough poor students (either lazy or confused) tried it that the Google algorithm took note.</p>
<p>From general (willing) readers, though, I almost always get the same question, which is some variation on “How did a nice suburban girl write such a dark story?” As if I should be writing about shoe shopping and Gymboree. So I tell them my father was a refugee, and we go from there.</p>
<p><strong>TR: </strong>“The Briefcase” could be any revolution at any time. What were you trying to achieve by giving this short story such an unfixed setting?</p>
<p><strong>RM:</strong> My father escaped Hungary after participating in the failed 1956 revolution, and I’ve always been fascinated by the revolutions – both political and personal – that will make someone abandon everything and start over.</p>
<p>I was pregnant when I wrote the story, and terrified by the prospect of labor. I kept reminding myself of all the billions of women who’d had babies, in all circumstances, and that commonality felt so reassuring. It brought me to that first image, of the prisoner/chef taking comfort in the fact that there have always been prisoners, and in the fact that his is an old, old story that will be repeated infinitely. It made sense, then, to work towards a setting that was as broad as possible, to emphasize those similarities across time and place.</p>
<p>What’s striking to me now, though, is how as I wrote I sat there thinking about revolutions of the past, and now it seems like the story could so easily be about 2011.</p>
<p><strong>TR: </strong>How are the study of physics, plays on time, and the idea of assumed identity related to one another? What were some challenges you faced while writing about such abstract concepts?</p>
<p><strong>RM: </strong>I got pretty wrapped up in my own head when I was working on the story, and there were several days where I was so immersed in it that even after I stopped working, I didn’t want to talk to anybody or think about anything else.</p>
<p>Since the philosophy involved is so off-kilter (an uneducated if thoughtful response to an intentionally ridiculous question), I was able to free-associate and go off on philosophical riffs rather than stay in any logical parameters. It was enormous fun to refer directly to the themes of history and time and space and identity – things I normally only get to hint at obliquely – and tie them so tightly around one man’s life.</p>
<p><strong>TR: </strong>Which of your short stories do you think appeals to the widest range of readers? A few of your stories delve into the academic world (“Painted Ocean, Painted Ship,&#8221; “Exit, Pursued”) while others are concerned with revolution (“The Briefcase,” “The Worst You Ever Feel”). Do you see a different kind of reader response to each of your short stories?</p>
<p><strong>RM: </strong>This breadth has been one of my major difficulties in thinking about an eventual short story collection. Collections are notoriously hard to sell, and readers will always be more interested if the stories are linked or, at the least, themed. I can’t yet envision a collection that will put “The Briefcase” next to the story I published last year in <em>Crazyhorse</em> about reality TV. I’ve thought about two separate collections down the road, focusing on exactly the themes you mentioned. (I will probably <em>not</em> do a collection about reality TV… although on second thought, that might be my golden ticket.)</p>
<p>The audience for short literary fiction is small and self-selected, though, and I imagine most of the people reading my stories right now are (like me) simply interested in good stories, regardless of the subject matter.</p>
<p><strong>TR: </strong>In your novel,<em> The Borrower</em>, Lucy says, “…all my reference points were fictions…all my narratives were lies.” How does this theme weave in with your multi-layered use of different novels and authors? The book is steeped with literary references. How does this work towards your own ideas about the power, and the implications, of fiction writing?</p>
<p><strong>RM: </strong>That’s one of the meanings of the book’s title, of course: beyond the obvious references to book borrowers, and to Lucy’s taking a child from his home, she also borrows from the books she loves in order to tell her story. This is a part of her character, as much as a narrative device. As a librarian, she is someone who has chosen to live her life among books, and she sees everything she experiences through a narrative lens.</p>
<p>This compulsive borrowing is not a device I’ve employed in any of my other work, and I doubt I’ll use it again. There are writers who, as a badge of their post-modernity, are constantly pulling from a vast library of references. I’m not one of them, but Lucy is.</p>
<p><strong>TR: </strong>There seems to be a definite political and religious charge throughout<em> </em>the novel. Was this a planned method for you to assert your own personal views, or was it more of an exploration of morality, society, and the contemporary moment?</p>
<p><strong>RM:</strong> Well, I hope no one comes away from <em>The Borrower</em> thinking I’m advocating kidnapping. My own personal concern with some of the issues at play – for instance, the rise of groups like Exodus International that try to turn gay teenagers straight – was part or what led me to write the book, but I don’t think fiction works well when it exists just to advance a certain political or even philosophical point.</p>
<p>A lot is left for debate at the end of the book, including Lucy’s own culpability and the long-term implications of what she’s done. I don’t picture squadrons of readers who all magically come to see things from my own point of view (which would be hard to locate in this narrative, actually, anyway); I imagine (and hope), rather, that there will be some impassioned yelling in book clubs and on blogs.</p>
<p><strong>TR: </strong>Did any of your own personal experiences influence the development of plot or of character in <em>The Borrower</em>? Is there any part of you in Lucy or your children in Ian?</p>
<p><strong>RM:</strong> Like Lucy, I’m a first-generation American, and I share her self-deprecating humor, but that’s about it. I’m particularly fortunate not to share her strange mixture of ambivalence and impulsivity, and of course none of her experiences are mine. The risk of publishing a book (especially a first book) where the narrator is first-person and close to my age is that people will assume more similarities than actually exist. Really, I’m not much of a “write what you know” writer, and one of the things I love most about my work is the pure invention. When people ask (as one person at every reading invariably will) where I “get my ideas,” I honestly have to answer that I don’t know. Writing is sort of like dreaming for me; once in a while I’ll know what real-life situation prompted me to think of something, but more often I emerge from a story going, “Where the hell did <em>that</em> come from?”</p>
<p><strong>TR:</strong> What were some challenges you faced in moving from writing short stories to a novel? What were some unexpected differences, or similarities, you found between writing short fiction and an entire novel?</p>
<p><strong>RM: </strong>I started working on <em>The Borrower</em> in 2000, long before I’d published my first story, and while my learning curves for novel-writing and story-writing were both steep, they were also simultaneous.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more room to move around in, in a novel, and that usually affects things like pace and the depth of characterization – but ultimately, I think we all have instincts about how to tell a shorter story or a longer story, and we make those choices in social situations every day.</p>
<p>The novel I’m working on right now actually did start as an unruly short story that refused to be edited down to a manageable length. When I finally gave up trying to squeeze it down into twenty pages, it revealed itself as a long, complicated novel.</p>
<p><strong>TR: </strong>What are you hoping to accomplish with this next novel? Are you drawing from any experiences you had in writing and publishing <em>The Borrower</em>? Can you make any comment about the temporal and geographic setting of this new story?</p>
<p><strong>RM: </strong>This second one is a bit more ambitious in narrative scope. I have multiple viewpoints and multiple time periods, and the story is also told in reverse… all of which mean I’ve had to plot things out meticulously ahead of time. With <em>The Borrower</em>, I made just a very general outline of the plot – and then at many points during the writing I wished I had spent more time planning out the overall structure back when I could see the whole project in one piece, rather than trying to make decisions when I was in the middle of it, my head barely above the water. It all worked out, but it was harder than it needed to be. This time I have about forty pages of detailed notes, and I know I’ll end up with more. I’ve also made sure to write down characters’ ages and full names and daily schedules, since those were things that threw me off in my first book; I’d know that Lucy, my librarian character, had a story hour, but I could never remember when it was, and so every time I wanted to refer to it I’d have to search the document for the page where I originally said it was on Friday. This time, it’s all printed out and highlighted.</p>
<p>An additional challenge with this book is that since the three main sections run in reverse chronological order, I have to know all the details of what happens in my last section (1929) in order to write my first section (1999). It feels a little like a Sudoku puzzle at times. I’ve even pasted calendars into my Word file for the years 1999, 1955 and 1929, along with extensive notes about current events and cars and music and politics. I don’t think I’ve ever been so organized with anything in my entire life.</p>
<p>It’s tentatively called <em>The Happensack</em>, and it’s set on Chicago’s North Shore, which is where I grew up and where I live now. I love having my inspiration so close to home, and as I drive around doing errands I feel like I’m simultaneously living my real life and living inside the novel.</p>
<p><strong>TR:</strong> What are you currently reading as you engage in writing another novel? You’ve mentioned a current interest in literature in translation, but are there any specific works you would like to point out?</p>
<p><strong>RM: </strong>When I’m drafting a novel – especially in the early stages – I want to read not just for pleasure but also to see how other writers have handled similar challenges. With <em>The Borrower</em>, I went back and reread both <em>Huckleberry Finn</em> and <em>Lolita</em>, and then I ended up using those as touchstones even within the text (as the narrator refers frequently to them both). This time, I’m keeping Tom Stoppard’s <em>Arcadia,</em> Daphne du Maurier’s <em>Rebecca</em> and Henry James’s <em>The Turn of the Screw</em> on my desk. The Stoppard play deals elegantly with pluralities of voice and time, while the other two are helping me to think about houses that might or might not be haunted.</p>
<p>I’m generally on a lighter kick right now, seeking out shorter books, because I spent a lot of the winter reading <em>Anna Karenina</em>. After my first daughter was born I read <em>Madame Bovary</em>, and I decided it would be perversely funny if, after my second daughter was born last fall, I read another long and disturbing novel about a selfish, suicidal woman. (I think this was my strange way of staving off post-partum depression. Unorthodox, but it worked.) Needless to say, I didn’t have as many reading hours this time with a toddler to watch, and thus an already long and bleak Russian novel stretched into a five-month undertaking. So for the immediate future I’m sticking to short, cheery books, preferably ones with fewer than two hundred main characters.</p>
<p><strong>TR: </strong>Is there a writer you currently see great potential for in for the future? Who is, in your opinion, the next person people must go out and read?</p>
<p>The playwright Sarah Ruhl is doing amazing things right now, and even if you can’t see her plays in New York, you can read them and absorb her strange and poetic stage directions. She’s not exactly a well-kept secret, though, and neither is Nicole Krauss, who I think is the fiction writer we’ll be seeing the most exciting things from in the next few decades.</p>
<p><strong>TR: </strong>There has been a lot of talked in and around the <em>Shenandoah </em>office about creative writing and publishing in the digital age. As you know, this interview appears in the first issue of <em>Shenandoah</em> that appears completely online. How do you think these changes in how creative writing is presented to readers will affect the craft itself? What do you think young writers should be aware of during this transitional period in the publishing world?</p>
<p>RM: I’m actually excited about the possibilities for new kinds of texts that will be made possible by new media. If we think way back to the origins of storytelling, it often included music and visual art and was much more interactive. The world is wide open now for people who want to think about new ways to tell stories. Unfortunately, much of the work I’ve seen that experiments with the new technology is also excessively focused on that technology as its subject (“Look! A novel made of emails!” “Look! A Twitter novel!”) instead of just being gracefully open to a postmodern sensibility, and to the embarrassment of riches we now have at our disposal. I might not be the person to take full advantage of that – I’m far more verbal than visual, and I think my stories will always just be very long strings of words – but I’m certainly a game audience for those experimenters out there.</p>
<p>On a different note, one thing I have become aware of, going through the publishing process for the first time, is how extremely vital the survival of independent bookstores is to the health of the literary world. Those booksellers’ recommendations, their willingness to host author events, and their dedication to finding and promoting books that will work for their particular clientele are all irreplaceable. One of the best things you can do to promote a vibrant literary landscape is to go into an independent bookstore or go to indiebound.org and buy hardcover fiction. Even if much of our reading becomes digital, I dearly hope there will always be a place for brick-and-mortar bookstores.</p>
<p><strong>TR: </strong>Thank you very much. I really enjoyed the time I spent reading your work and conducting research in preparation for this interview. Your time is a very valuable thing to offer, and I appreciate the opportunity to work with you.</p>
<p><strong>RM: </strong>No problem – just the tip of the iceberg of what I owe <em>Shenandoah</em>!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m going to discuss a book you’ll never find in any bookstore, never see, never own. Its simple title, <em>Twenty-six Poems,</em> names the late flowering of a poet whose talent is deep, whose life has taken him to places and pursuits other than poetry and to whom life has now offered both a different choice and no choice at all:</p>
<blockquote><p>Already darkness<br />
Lies down among the laurels, the near hillside<br />
Plowed and planted<br />
In the green thrall of tobacco.<br />
Clouds off the Blue Ridge laden with rain<br />
Hang in the middle distance forever,<br />
A rim of light the demarcation<br />
Between mountains and sky.<br />
The air cools<br />
To a gathering radiance,<br />
Soon to be shadow, then limbo, then night.</p>
<p>&#8212; from “Already Darkness”</p></blockquote>
<p>The lines are lyric and cool. Like sea-smoothed stones in the hand, they calm, weighted with depth. William Keens is the poet, and I want you to meet him through his poems and the story of a long ago friendship. His work is elegant, rarely showy, restrained and daring. Moments like “the near hillside plowed and planted / in the green thrall of tobacco” flare to light the poem into memory, and though the quoted lines bring on the dark, they do so with a hymn’s quiet praise.</p>
<p>The poem “The Body Bends,” here in its entirety, engages us differently. Short lines alternate with longer ones to punctuate the dark wit the poem employs so well:</p>
<blockquote><p>THE BODY BENDS</p>
<p>The body bends<br />
To its demise, takes a bow<br />
Then retires<br />
With the cast that populates a life.</p>
<p>So much for planning. It doesn’t matter &#8212;<br />
Thug, friend or child molester,<br />
All lines<br />
Converge in babble at the end.</p>
<p>What’s true<br />
Shimmers like paradise through a keyhole.<br />
The old<br />
Stoop to it, stoop and stay doubled</p>
<p>With laughter<br />
Or the labor of starting over.</p></blockquote>
<p>Internal slant-rhymes “demise” and “retires” add power. “Life,” coming after with some irony, is a slant rhyme for both. In the second stanza, “friend” and “end” continue the irregular pattern, the first appearing between “thug” and “child molester,” equalizing all toward “end.” “All lines / converge in babble” the poet tells us, even as his lines direct us to more definite and delightful interpretation. Deepening into “What’s true” without specifying, the poem moves to the unseen view that “shimmers through a keyhole” toward which the old will bend to see. “Stoop” is repeated, slant rhyming with “true.” Whoever looks through this keyhole, whose revelation is like paradise, will stoop and “stay doubled” &#8212; and we can double that image as we will &#8212; “with laughter / or the labor of starting over.” Playful and sad but ultimately affirming, the poem compels re-reading, the slant rhymes of “laughter,” “labor” and “over” performing their own associate play. “The Body Bends,” like a number of other poems here, begins with a matter-of-fact darkness, then enlightens by confounding expectations. As does the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>END OF THE DAY</p>
<p>Cloud fields, cloud floes<br />
Great polar expanses<br />
Of iced air banked and layered beneath us<br />
From sunset to darkness as our plane beelines north.</p>
<p>Up here existence<br />
Is tenuous but light-hearted, at this hour<br />
Defined as a far room of color, cloud-radiant<br />
And night coming on.<br />
I could step out, try to walk<br />
If they’d hold me, the weightless ones</p>
<p>I loved in the past, still love and would gladly<br />
Embrace again their ethereal forms.<br />
Flight makes me think<br />
How dying will be &#8212; carried off over the ice pack.</p>
<p>The stars so brilliant,<br />
Numerous, indifferent, the light almost liquid,<br />
Trekkers and swimmers and silver transporters,<br />
The air full of us,<br />
More than anyone knew,</p>
<p>Each returning to a room<br />
Where the light is still on and someone &#8212; a figure<br />
Silhouetted in the window &#8212;<br />
Waits up in God-knows-what kind of mood.</p></blockquote>
<p>The last stanza’s tonal change is half anticipated, yet startling. “Up here existence / is tenuous but light-hearted” could serve as description of the whole poem. The ghosts the poet imagines peopling the air around him, “more than anyone knew,” are benign, beloved whoever they are, stranger or kin. The last stanza gives the poet and each ethereal form a trajectory toward the room where mystery is, and fear, and rueful laughter. The figure, metaphor for past, or Creator, or angel or kinsman, waiting up in “God-knows-what kind of mood” is like a parent, possibly furious, waiting for a tardy child. The line brings on a flinching smile. Like many here, this poem charms with a mixture of clarity and strangeness.</p>
<p>EVIDENCE OF ANGELS</p>
<p>Trying to divine<br />
Something sacred &#8212; what the long line<br />
Played out and reeled in<br />
Delivers silvery, wet and flopping<br />
Ungodlike<br />
But alive on the crescent of the beach.</p>
<p>Of course they disguise themselves &#8212;<br />
Fish with wings, weather vanes,<br />
High-flying hawks &#8212;<br />
Those “purely spiritual and<br />
Splendid beings”<br />
(This from an Islamic tract)<br />
Who row and spin in their interceding,</p>
<p>The sum a practical account:<br />
Crops grow,<br />
Tumors fade, children<br />
Remain whole, the thread doesn’t break.</p>
<p>Sublime, sublime<br />
The evidence of angels.<br />
For them, the bamboo<br />
Unfurls its shade, long poles that<br />
Sway and clack<br />
Like socketed pinions in the shimmering air.<br />
Otherwise</p>
<p>Murmurs in the crown,<br />
A sudden cooling like the advent of rain.</p>
<p>William Keens has faced, since the age of fifty-four, a diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease. Now sixty-two, he is still able to lead a full life. <em>Twenty-six Poems</em> was an unexpected gift from Bill when he came for a visit, after decades of no contact between us. You won’t see the book because it is privately printed in an edition of only one hundred copies for family and friends of the poet. The copy I hold in my hand is a beautiful object, its simple green cloth cover lovely to the touch. The hand-binding is evident, the design elegant, the paper handmade. Its power, however, as you have read, is in the strikingly rich material inside.</p>
<p>AFTER THE GREAT WAR</p>
<p>A train crosses the desert.</p>
<p>The shadow of a train<br />
Ripples like the negative image of wind<br />
Over a plain of lizards.<br />
We are their passing dream: bright metal</p>
<p>Of the dining car decked in clouds, the bone<br />
Face of my father.<br />
I brush salt from my palm<br />
And remember an outing with my family.</p>
<p>My grandmother rests in a dry light<br />
And talks of her labors<br />
The year Debs was in prison,<br />
Making flowers until her fingers bloomed like poppies.</p>
<p>I look from her outstretched hands<br />
Toward the others:<br />
My grandfather mowed down by sleep,<br />
Mother at her easel, father rowing into the wind.</p>
<p>So we were. Every day<br />
I searched for news of our armistice &#8212;<br />
Wind in the mesquite, wind looking for something &#8212;<br />
Every night redrafted the terms of our peace.</p>
<p>In “Names for the Heirloom,” which accents the naming that poetry is, the poet’s Italian grandmother sews in a high room in New York. Perhaps it is a quilt she is sewing, perhaps a coat, perhaps a dream or a song. Or all of these:</p>
<p>NAMES FOR THE HEIRLOOM</p>
<p>In the simple darkness of her kitchen, my nonna<br />
Stitches, stitches, stitches.<br />
Snips of thread and linen fall like snow into her lap.<br />
Her dress is black,<br />
Cut from the shirts of fascists, her hands<br />
Lie down like old companions,<br />
Two sisters in the winter olive grove sleeping</p>
<p>Or lovers or partisans. They travel among us:<br />
Two immigrants, two peasants, two voting socialists.<br />
We are the last known<br />
Ark of creation, sailing under threat of forgetfulness<br />
From that distant mooring, a kitchen in the dark<br />
As snow falls over West Fourth Street<br />
And I listen to my grandmother sew</p>
<p>Ever Near, Always With You,<br />
Something to wear in that storm.</p>
<p>Echoes of Neruda hover around this poem without upstaging the story. Again a strategy of slant rhyme animates the lines, with “kitchen” and the three “stitches” and “snips” working music into the beginning, music that shows up again as the poem moves into magic, the grandmother’s hands becoming two sisters, two compatriots, two lovers or partisans. The speaker and his grandmother are the “last known / Ark of creation” in the kitchen, floating in the dark, in the snow over New York’s West Fourth Street, and the immigrant’s heritage descending as the grandmother sews “Something to wear in that storm.”</p>
<p>Why write about a book that will never appear in a bookstore? And who is William Keens? I confess to reasons of both aesthetics and personal connection. And herein is a little history.</p>
<p>As the first Randall Jarrell Scholar at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Keens studied with Robert Watson and Fred Chappell. From there. he went on to the Iowa Writers Workshop to study with Donald Justice, Norman Dubie and Marvin Bell, graduating with a stellar class that included Tess Gallagher, David St. John, Michael Ryan, Denis Johnson and Laura Jensen, among others. Some of his work was published in journals, and there was a small chapbook from Penumbra Press in Iowa. There were years of hard work teaching English at an excellent and very old private high school in Raleigh, North Carolina. That’s where I met Bill, and therein lies our small adventure.</p>
<p>He was the most intense young man I ever met. Determined, driven, focused and very, very smart, he wanted everything &#8212; poetry, success, travel, love, beauty, art &#8212; the world. In the few years I knew him (can it have been thirty-five years since we met?), he was able to energize a group of us toward efforts we’d never imagined on our own. He talked me and another poet into starting &#8212; or trying to start &#8212; an honest-to-God serious literary journal. We loved gathering to talk poems and argue poetics, and somehow the idea of a journal grew. We could call it <em>Saxifrage</em> after the William Carlos Williams line and the flower said to split rock.</p>
<p>Against all odds, we &#8212; and this means mostly Bill &#8212; were able to raise enough money to publish the first issue with first-rate paper and art. And it was Bill who was able to get commitments for poems, essays and stories from some of the best writers around, including Dave Smith, Morris Dickstein and Elizabeth Sewell.</p>
<p>Bill also oversaw, with some help from us, getting the necessary tax-exempt status and the national distributor (DeBoer) we would need. Ours, we told ourselves, wouldn’t be just another literary magazine, but the best literary magazine ever! We were, after all, young.</p>
<p>Of course, our venture failed. Even before we could gather the first issue together, we came to see that with the longevity requirement for grants, the huge costs of production, the forty percent coming off the top for distribution and uncertain revenue from subscribers and advertisers for the foreseeable future, we’d have to raise large sums of money again and again. We knew we couldn’t swing it.</p>
<p>So we changed directions. Bill’s idea, of course. We decided to establish a literary prize: After contacting our donors and gaining their permission, we used the funds collected for the magazine to set up the Saxifrage Prize Competition. Open only to books published by university or small independent presses, the competition would award the Prize to poetry books and books of short fiction in alternating years. The winning author would receive $1,000 and would be brought to North Carolina for a three-city reading tour. The three copies of each book entered were donated, after the award year, to the public libraries of each of the cities hosting a reading. The entries poured in by the hundreds. The first winner was Robert Pinsky’s <em>An Explanation of America</em>, and the five finalists were equally as stunning. I arranged the Raleigh reading at the North Carolina Museum of Art, where Pinsky read among the Renaissance paintings, with a large crowd present.</p>
<p>The competition lasted five years, then the money ran out, and we were done. Bill had learned that he was very good indeed at working with people, at fund raising, designing plans and following through. He moved to Manhattan even before our competition ended, where he took a job editing <em>American Arts</em> magazine, the publication of the umbrella organization of American Arts Councils. Soon he was tapped to run the organization that published the magazine. Thereafter, he began a successful business of his own as a consultant to donors and grantees alike. With a happy second marriage that gave him and Caroline Watson two sons, Bill had fulfilled his ambitions, found meaningful work that rewarded him well: the yearned-for travel, a long-term connection with the arts and a full family life.</p>
<p>The diagnosis of Parkinson’s in 2002 changed Bill’s life, of course. His consulting business pared down, his perspective on the future was altered and he gained an expanded sense of the value of every day and reclaimed his art. He had already begun writing poetry after a hiatus of decades, and that call became stronger. In the four-part poem “Covenant of Circles” the following lines are addressed to poetry itself, to the muse if you will:</p>
<p>My poor half-sister streams through the window.<br />
She is the morning light, I labor<br />
In the hem of her dress<br />
Trying to sew a fold in the radiance</p>
<p>And fail again. But hold in my hand<br />
The light body that breaks into flame<br />
Like tongues into canticles. . . .</p>
<p>The poem moves then from Madame Curie to Einstein, from Copernicus to Galileo, its line limning circles, hymns to light and galaxies, to “the Zodiac’s fish-filled, goat-raucous band,” and to “All who rode into the shadows and never came out again; / Shed fire, sang, burned with fever.” It&#8217;s a risky, brilliant poem.</p>
<p>These slower days, and occasionally using a cane to maintain his balance, Bill works with a few select clients as a consultant, visits Italy to be with relatives on his mother&#8217;s side, with whom he has established ties, spends time with Caroline and his boys, and writes.  He has also founded a website with his colleague Brian Lemond of Brooklyn Digital Foundry.  <em>The Poetry Ark</em> is a sort of interactive salon for poetry lovers and has culminated in <em>The Ark Anthology</em>, one hundred poems voted on by users, downloadable at www.poetryark.com</p>
<p>One of the most moving and interesting among the <em>Twenty-Six Poems</em> is this one:</p>
<p>Inversion</p>
<p>Root trunk and branch<br />
Root trunk and branch</p>
<p>Outspread up-ended<br />
Root could be crown being<br />
Source and mooring<br />
In wind gale and tempest<br />
Wind gale and tempest</p>
<p>Blows the errant seagull inland<br />
Wheatfield mystery of that oracular bird</p>
<p>Just so the displaced unexpected<br />
Rogue cell misfiring neuron<br />
Age that narrow constrains constricts<br />
Blood&#8217;s course heart&#8217;s errant tick<br />
Until</p>
<p>Breathless battered sapped<br />
Looking down looks up into that starry net</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written here about a book both present and unavailable, and I&#8217;ve done so to make it, at least in part, present for those who read this.  I&#8217;ve written not out of a long ago friendship, but because the poems are original, beautiful, strange, deeply sad, deeply celebratory, and necessary to their author in ways that make them necessary for the reader who finds them.  I have written here because the making of poems, the thing itself (&#8220;the light that body breaks into flame like tongues into canticles&#8221;), matters so much more than <em>careers</em> in poetry &#8212; in teaching or performance or publishing &#8212; and because some poets write in the dark and thereby write themselves out of darkness into light.  All the candles matter, however windblown, when the gift is there, when the flame is a true one.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>when the dogwood petals begin to fall<br />
a glass of milk knocked over on the grass<br />
like the glass I spilled on my mother&#8217;s banjo<br />
a skin of change across the morning<br />
table she&#8217;d laid it on when I was six<br />
when the dogwood petals begin to drift<br />
then I am less and when they are torn<br />
in a startling hard spring rain I am<br />
unmoored as the tree is ripped<br />
so all its milky petals on the ground<br />
just disappear they will not return<br />
no more excursions from the branch<br />
this year the banjo my mother stroked<br />
with her clicking silver finger picks<br />
like claws like machine gears flashing<br />
faster and faster her curved hands<br />
raking across the strings such ringing<br />
echoes from that hollow drum<br />
and its tightened skin by accident<br />
on the glassy disk of her instrument<br />
I knocked the glass of milk so quickly it<br />
ran I think I laughed then thinking<br />
change was pretty overlaid silver skin<br />
thin running liquid when the dogwood<br />
leaves begin to fall – no, petals – leaves<br />
still hang their secrecies tenacious<br />
but without the incandescent spread<br />
across the morning and at night<br />
amid the other darknesses petals<br />
flaring a skeletal miracle<br />
I am sad girls are indelicate banjo<br />
strings taut in their silver girdle<br />
sharp in memory as my mother<br />
calls out the petals already fallen<br />
which tells us spring is over now forget</p>

<p><em>North Carolina Blue Ridge</em></p>
<p>Here earth juts and tumbles in woods<br />
where mountain creeks purl, slake through<br />
rock, sluice schist coves and sheltered</p>
<p>gaps, then push hard through piebald sheer,<br />
down to the slant of a cabin leaning:<br />
Dusk’s long shadow flickers dark</p>
<p>in this singular room, where my kin huddle<br />

burbles over pine-hiss and ember—</p>
<p>Fire grinds the weight of nightfall<br />
on their silence, toil-dark scowls<br />
over tight frowns, throats hungry</p>
<p>to down day’s reaping. Here, land<br />
is the sole tongue, etched in intricate syntax<br />
of apple and trillium, the garden’s blood-idiom,</p>
<p>husk-dry stanzas quenched by prophecies<br />
of rain. Nights, when their worn out bodies<br />
die into sleep, their dreams are rationed</p>
<p>to applewood and rattlers, valleys’ tobacco<br />
and fodders stacks, the few words passed<br />
that I take with me, write down, and move on.</p>

Your grandfather fades behind the creak<br />
of the barn door, mouth trembling with sermons<br />
lodged forever behind his tongue. You breathe</p>

then slog in the heat of horses,<br />
saddled by noon rains, mud choking the yield.<br />
Nights, back in the stanch purity of those rooms,</p>
<p>with soap-burned hands you wrap your head<br />
with words: sorghum and lantern, cellar and sin.<br />
Then down into image, the earth’s nightlong gift:<br />
Your mother’s scarred hands fondling the plump coinage</p>
<p>of tomatoes, the pox of aphids washed immaculate.<br />
Her gloves uncoiling barbed wire, gauzing the reddening scrape.<br />
The hiss and warmth of embers, cedar-smoke’s tang.<br />
Always she dims again beneath black water</p>
<p>as mornings wrest you from sleep like a breech foal<br />
torn loose, shivering in the hay.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since birth, I have endured the Scotch-Irish curse of spots. By this I mean freckles, freckles everywhere—face, chest, back, arms and legs. At a swimming pool in Atlanta, during my high school years, a Yankee gaped at the quarter-sized freckles on my shirtless torso and shouted, “Hey, kid, what’s wrong? You got leprosy or something?” Scattered among the freckles there are also a few nevi, also called “moles”—those pigmented bumps that afflict most of the human race.</p>
<p>My spot-related anxieties first came upon me during a lecture in medical school, when I saw the photograph of a ragged black spot on a patient’s thigh. An X-ray showed his lungs filled with malignant nodules the size of golf balls. The man had a melanoma, an insidious skin cancer that can resemble a nevus during its early stages. My God, I thought—that could be me! I raced to the surgery clinic, where a resident agreed that a nevus on my chest had a worrisome pearly border. I still bear the scar of its almost instant excision. To my immense relief, pathologic examination showed no sign of malignancy.</p>
<p>My anxieties lay dormant for three years, until I examined a young law student who had dark nodules scattered beneath his skin, nodules that had spread from a melanoma on his scrotum. The poor victim was my age, almost to the day, and in the rush of an instant, this dreadful coincidence set my old obsession aflame.</p>
<p>I tried to calm myself with reason—this was nothing, just a foolish anxiety like all those that had gone before—but a terrifying truth kept fighting its way through my defenses: six of my spots are on a place where half the human race doesn’t even have a place. Not on the scrotum, like the malignant lesion that had spread through the law student’s bloodstream, but damn close. Five of these spots look like innocent freckles, while the sixth shows, by a slight elevation above the surface of my skin, the features of a nevus. But was it really a nevus, or was it… could it be… a melanoma?</p>
<p>The moment the doomed patient left my exam room, I took an early lunch break, then rushed, sweaty and tremulous, to the dermatology clinic. Here Doctor Gantry, the chief resident, listened to my story and examined me carefully, peering through a magnifying lens held inches from the organ under study. He was a good man. His deep, soothing voice calmed me down. He assured me this was not a crisis, since the lesion causing me so much distress was almost certainly benign, though there might be some risk &#8212;  very small —but one that had to be considered, since on rare occasions a melanoma can arise from what appears to be a benign nevus. He would consult his colleagues.</p>
<p>The word “colleagues” disturbed me.   With how many doctors would he share the story of my worrisome spot? Soon after he left the exam room, I heard a murmur of voices, zipped my fly shut and cracked the door, only to discover a squadron of white coats gathered in the hallway. It seemed that every student and resident and faculty member in the whole department had gathered for an avid discussion. Surely, God forbid, this wasn’t all about me?</p>
<p>It was. At last the gentle Doctor Gantry entered the exam room with a female colleague in tow. He closed the door, then explained that, after some debate, two schools of thought had emerged concerning the management of my problem. One school—the more conservative, to which he belonged—advocated a policy of live and let live: keep an eye on the worrisome nevus, and if anything changed, then a biopsy would be in order (by <a href="http://www.dresshead.com/dresshead-staff-profile-joann-whiteside" style="text-decoration: none;color: #333">whiteside</a> at <a href="http://www.dresshead.com" style="text-decoration: none;color: #333">http://www.dresshead.com</a>). From this debate, however, there had also arisen a more aggressive approach, one advocated by Doctor Taylor, the sturdy, dark-haired woman standing impatiently by his side.</p>
<p>To this day I remember her first words to me.  Not &#8220;Glad to meet you,&#8221; or &#8220;How are you today,&#8221; but “Ok, let’s see it.”  Yet more disturbing were the words that came after Exhibit A had been hauled out and inspected with a magnifying glass. “Ah, no question—they’ve <em>all</em> got to come off!”</p>
<p>“All!” I spluttered. “But those… those others… the five, except for this one… those…surely… they’re just freckles.”</p>
<p>“Freckles!” she said with a derisive snort. “To get freckles, you’ve got to have sunlight, and I don’t think… you tell me—have you…?”</p>
<p>No, I confessed, my precious parts had yet to see the full light of the noonday sun. But surely, I argued, all six spots looked benign. Couldn’t we just wait and see, do a biopsy if there was any change?</p>
<p>“Sure we could wait,” Doctor Taylor said. “But if the pathologist found malignant cells, to be sure he got all the tumor, the surgeon would have to go back and excise several cubic centimeters of adjacent tissue. An alarming prospect, wouldn’t you say, given the, uh, body part involved?”</p>
<p>Alarming indeed. My legs trembled so badly I could hardly stand. After she left, Gantry told me to sit down and stepped from the room to bring me a cup of water. There was no rush.  No reason to panic.  His voice droned on and on, so gentle and reassuring I expected him to pat me on the head. In any case, he said, I needed to see a plastic surgeon, the specialist best qualified to perform such a delicate procedure.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The next morning, I skipped a lecture and made my way down to plastic surgery clinic, where the receptionist, a tiny blonde woman, got things off to a bad start by asking the fatal question:  “What’s the nature of your problem?”</p>
<p>“Well, uh… I… uh… .” I said. After an awkward silence, “Let me wait… I’ll tell the doctor myself.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, sir,” she said, “but we need this information so the nurse can prepare you for the doctor’s exam.”</p>
<p>“Oh, God,” I said, then covered my mouth with my hand. We stared at each other. She held her pen poised over a clipboard, eager to record the nature of a problem that seemed so bizarre it would surely evoke fits of helpless laughter. I imagined the receptionist rushing about the clinic to share my riotous story with every female in sight, or leaning toward me across the counter, her eyes wide in disbelief, shouting, “Noooooooo, you’ve got to be kidding!”</p>
<p>“Look,” I said at last, “you’ll just have to take my word for it. I don’t need a nurse to help me show my problem to the doctor. I can do it all by myself, and it won’t take a second. Trust me, please…”</p>
<p>“Well…” she said, giving me the look one might give a stubborn child. “Ok, if you insist.”</p>
<p>Relieved for the moment, chart in hand, I was led down a corridor to a cubicle that contained a sink, an examination table, and a small metal stool. When the door closed behind me, I unbuttoned my shirt, ripped two paper towels out of the dispenser above the sink and tucked them into my sopping armpits. I sat on the stool for what seemed like an hour, listening to occasional footsteps and muffled voices in the hallway. At last, a brief knock announced the arrival of my savior.</p>
<p>It was Doctor O’Riley, the chief resident in plastic surgery, a squat Irishman with a cheerful lilt to his voice. The instant he stepped through the door, I gave a sigh of relief. He had red hair and pale skin. A constellation of reddish brown freckles spread across his nose and down his cheeks. Three darker spots—nevi, no doubt—were clustered on the lower lid of one eye. I  also recognized an irregular, yellow-brown conjunctival nevus on the white of that eye. Here was a fellow who could sympathize with my plight.</p>
<p>When I told him about Doctor Taylor’s dogged insistence that I submit my organ for multiple biopsies, O’Riely scowled.</p>
<p>“Damn that woman,” he said, “she’s at it again!”  Apparently Taylor had referred other terrified males for surgical extraction of spots from their delicate parts. O’Riley explained the hazard of her whack-‘em-all-off approach—bands of residual scar that might cause ripping pain when put under the tension of an erection. Moreover, a surgeon would have to excise thousands of benign nevi before he discovered one melanoma.</p>
<p>“Okay,” O&#8217;Riely said at last, “let’s take a look.”  When I unzipped my fly to expose myself for microscopic examination, he exclaimed, “Only six lesions!” Hell, I’ve got more than that. Don’t worry about the damn things. Come back if you notice any change. By the way, I think you’re right—those other five lesions are most likely freckles. And leave that little nevus alone. It isn’t nearly as dangerous as a drive down the Bay Shore Freeway.”</p>
<p>“Thanks… thanks a lot,” I said. “I can’t tell you…”</p>
<p>That was the truth—I couldn’t tell him. The lump in my throat made it hard to speak. I left the clinic in a rush, lest my spotted Irish savior see the tears of gratitude gathering in my eyes.  Worse yet, had I stayed around another moment, I might have lost all, thrown my arms around the poor man and kissed him on a rosy cheek.</p>
<p>My spots have behaved themselves for four decades.  In return, I have spared them the scrutiny of yet another microscopic inspection.  And unlike many of Dr. Taylor&#8217;s victims, I don&#8217;t double over in pain every time temptation comes my way.</p>

In her first novel, <em>The Borrower</em>, Rebecca Makkai tackles these questions as well as the more subtle themes of identity formation, the self-concept, and the possibilities of future generations. <em>The Borrower </em>is indeed the story of “a would-be revolutionary stuck at desk,” in other words, “a dormant volcano.” Exploring family, memory, and what it means to dream, Makkai uses straightforward yet somewhat psychological prose to create the story of a journey that is motivated by the impossible pursuit of knowing who you are and how you came to be that way. This very idea of the impossibility of knowing, of being able to grasp one’s self-concept, is reflected by the many surprises found throughout the novel, a feature of the story which makes it difficult to discuss without undermining the author’s strategy.</p>
<p>Reading and revolution are parallel strands in the novel. The novel’s protagonist, Lucy, is a librarian who comes from “a long line of revolutionaries.” Almost trying to escape the limitations of her Russian upbringing, and the secrecy thereof, Lucy takes a rebellious path that leads her to one of the least controversial places: the children’s section of a library. Facing a crisis of identity and the struggle to find out who she is as a result of where she came from, Lucy finds herself in a position many mid-to-late twenty-year-olds find themselves in. Graduating from college and striking out from home has not led Lucy to either an ideal life or a mature self-awareness, and the novel explores the ways in which people achieve a well-rounded perspective of who they are and who they want to be. Soon, Lucy looks to a person much younger than her to understand how to fashion an identity out of one’s dreams.</p>
<p>Lucy’s dynamic relationship with an intellectually curious, and possibly homosexual, ten-year-old boy ultimately leads to an unexpected kidnapping and a revelatory road trip. Bound up in this journey is the pervasive idea of freedom, and the possibility of earning freedom through a revolution of one’s own personal experience. Lucy constantly struggles to resolve her desire for “endless possibility” with her “librarian’s sensibility,” and her adventure with Ian only seems to upend her understanding of herself. However, Lucy is not the hero of this story, in fact, she “might be the villain.” At the core of the novel is Ian, a boy who is so full of potential and offers the possibility of what the life of a dreamer, and a revolutionary, could truly be like.</p>
<p>Ian’s family background is rather troubling. Struggling to find his expressive voice in his fundamentalist Christian home, this active mind finds freedom in the many books that he reads. For Ian, the library becomes a place not for escape, but rather, a sanctuary where he can broaden his scope of the world and develop his perspective of possibility. As Lucy fights to understand her past and sort out her present, Ian provides a sense of potential, and where revolution could lead. Furthermore, the hopeful future Ian represents is one that can be found in the everyday lives and experiences of normal people. Makkai unites the reader with Ian by demonstrating that, although his life has its own flaws and tragedies, these are not the tragedies of the heroes so often found in literature. Ian’s spirit of revolution and dreams of freedom are the dreams anyone who has ever experienced containment or limitation can recognize.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, Russian mobsters, a relentless ex-boyfriend, and a serious lack of money do not make Lucy and Ian’s quest any easier. Potential consequences of their journey always lurk in the back of Lucy’s head, from her fear of legal consequences to the ideological consequences of returning Ian to his overbearing parents and the troublesome Pastor Bob, Ian’s spiritual adviser and teacher of “anti-gay” classes. Although the novel pushes us into the microcosm of Ian and Lucy’s world, which seems safe and almost wholesome despite the illegality of the situation, it is impossible to forget the realities of the outside world, and the absurdity thereof. Throughout their quest Lucy has to develop a complex set of lies, and constantly has to answer questions about who she is and where she is going, and this inability to truly escape from the limitations of everyday life demonstrates an accountability to others that can be both nourishing and destructive.</p>
<p>Makkai employs mature techniques, imbuing each character with a well-developed complexity that forces the reader to constantly question and examine what it means to be a hero, a villain, a child, or a librarian. The depth given to each character allows the reader to wonder about the very nature of what makes a person moral, corrupt, or happy.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the narrative shape of the novel is almost cyclical, and the conclusion finds the reader returning to many of the themes and challenges presented at the start of this novel. Lucy’s struggles in the beginning of the novel remain persistent to the end. Revolution has to be read alongside this repetitive notion of time where “you can’t keep going, you can’t go back, and you can’t stay here.” Indeed, the novel itself does not remain self-contained. By the conclusion of the story the reader is left as unsure and wary of the future as Lucy. She thinks to herself, “What happy ending could I have been nursing, this whole time? It lurked there like a dream, half remembered. There was a picture from somewhere of a place I would take him, maybe a place from a book: a white-walled, sunny house where people took care of children, where they would explain everything and let him stay there forever or until he was strong enough to face his parents. Or we would all launch out together in our happy little boat and forge a new country on new land rising from the ocean foam: an ideal America finally again.” Urging a new evaluation of how to consider endings, happy or otherwise, Makkai hints that perhaps what is considered satisfactory in the present condition is just not enough.</p>
<p>Trying to understand what makes Lucy an admirable character is perhaps where Makkai’s strengths shine through. The push and pull between like and dislike, sympathizing and condemning, forced upon the reader reveals the complexity of Lucy and perhaps the complexity of all people living in the modern condition. Lucy’s story demonstrates the plethora of choices people make every day, and her mistakes show how incredibly important every choice can be. In many ways, <em>The Borrower </em>is a timeless story of human connection and impact, and how the choices we make can deeply affect others around us. It is Makkai’s astutely chosen words and her ability to weave themes that have always concerned the human condition that make <em>The Borrower</em> an excellent read for those who like to ask questions and those who appreciate the pursuit of finding answers.</p>

<strong><em>Young of the Year</em></strong> by Sydney Lea  (Four Way Books, 2011)</p>
<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/41MOSnusciL._SL500_AA300_.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-832" title="Young of the Year Lea" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/41MOSnusciL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="" width="235" height="235" srcset="https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/41MOSnusciL._SL500_AA300_.jpg 300w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/41MOSnusciL._SL500_AA300_-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 235px) 100vw, 235px" /></a>How often do I see that a poet (or even a mystic)  has written with conviction that he or she accepts, even embraces the grand circle dance of the natural world, which will of course guarantee the poet’s eventual demise, dust to dust and all that?  And how often do I respond “bullshot,” or something similar?  But when Sydney Lea concludes the final, title poem of this collection with accepting “of course”s – “Of course the glorious earth// will take me back, of course the young-year hare give profligate birth” – I nod and am wholly persuaded.  This is in part due to the ways the poem’s previous forty lines address what is past and passing and to come and partly because the whole volume weighs the woe and the weal of life with such meticulous honesty and imagination, right down to the “steaming purple pip” of a sparrow’s heart, but my response is also a function of my on-going admiration of Lea’s poetic stamina, his decades of poems that run without rushing, his extended narratives that haul along a whole landscape and an invisible world of delicious and perilous particulars, not call and response so much as cry and “countercry.”</p>
<p>This volume offers a whole trophy case of excellent poems, some of which appeared in <em>Shenandoah</em>, but I want to call particular attention to “Dubber’s Cur,” in part because it’s dedicated to the late John Engels, a poet deeply mourned but not widely enough remembered, or memorized.  Lea’s narrative recounts the sophisticated (“French bread,” “organic,” “foreign car”) speaker’s on-going scraps with a less polished (“common law,” “Scrawny pony,” “junkheap ramble”) neighbor’s dog, the cur of the title, who makes sorties into French bread’s yard, snarling and pissing and annoying the house dogs no end.  In what could easily become a class war concluding with shotgunned rocksalt and the narrator’s victory strut, Lea finds a stronger virtue than protecting one’s demesne.  He does not blame the renegade, but turns the question of passion and mission on his reader who “may have sensed/ a near-exalting rightness/ in doggedly keeping at it, just as Dubber’s cur/ keeps at his climb, shows up.”  The extended empathy and forgiveness, the willingness to project and understand are all important to the poem and in some way a tribute to Engels, one of our most sorrowful losses of recent years, but the real point is the poetry, the pace and shift of language, the restraint and abundance, the interrogated certainty.  I can think of people who would read “Dubber’s Cur” and not want to devour the whole collection, but I might not much care for their company.</p>

<strong><em>Copperhead</em></strong> by Rachel Richardson (Carnegie Mellon, 2011)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Copperhead-Rachel-Richardson/dp/0887485367"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-872" title="Copperhead Richardson" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/Copperhead-192x300.jpg" alt="" width="142" height="222" srcset="https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/Copperhead-192x300.jpg 192w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/Copperhead.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 142px) 100vw, 142px" /></a>I am still learning how to read this book, its skitter styles and sly admissions, its portrait of the sowbelly, roadside, catfish South I know and love, and it has old friend Audubon, Leadbelly, escaped horses and snakes, even early/virgin Britney Spears photo-posing at a slave cabin, guilt and hope, and nobody has written figs this deliciously since D. H. Lawrence.  It’s a book about sorrowful home and wistful demesne, swamps and crimes of passion, a song to keep you alive, “Vipers, that spring, spread thick on the ground,” “mak[ing] music of anything you have.”  If the train bound for Rachel Richardson’s Louisiana stops near where I’m biding time, I’ll soon be long gone.</p>

<strong><em>Human Chain</em></strong> by Seamus Heaney  (FSG, 2010)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Copperhead-Rachel-Richardson/dp/0887485367"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-875" title="Human Chain Heaney" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/img-article-stothard-brit-lit-1015-human-chain_122544912150-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="160" height="240" srcset="https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/img-article-stothard-brit-lit-1015-human-chain_122544912150-199x300.jpg 199w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/img-article-stothard-brit-lit-1015-human-chain_122544912150.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px" /></a>Several decades ago devilish reviewers started sniping at Seamus Heaney, who has long been Famous Seamus to his detractors, and they never seem to tire of repeating themselves.  His rustic scenes were rusty, his gritty diction discordant, his trove of obsolete utensils edgeless, his bonhomie ridiculous, his politics cagily cautious to the point of cowardice.  Even, later, his <em>Electric Light</em> too light.  And eventually the work earned some of their skepticism.  The collections released since he pitched in earnest into his wonderful Hiburnisized translation of <em>Beowulf</em> have featured fewer amazements and surprises than I was accustomed to in <em>North</em> or <em>Station Island</em>.  In the less exciting poems, his relationship with the muse had grown cozier, as if he routinely tossed her (it/them/us) a piece of doctored meat.  But nestled in each collection were a few poems that carried the genuine ore of his genius.</p>
<p><em>Human Chain</em> contains more than a few.  On a cool afternoon, tired of the strut and fret of so much contemporary poetry, the antic erudition and hipper-than-thou newness of the prompt-driven, workshopped muldoonery and joriation and snarky fool’s gold, I settled back against a rock off the Blue Ridge Parkway and began to honeydip in Heaney’s most recent demonstration of the old ways of being new.  Probably more than a few Heaniphiles and Heaniphobes have wondered what impact his recent stroke had on an already-serious writer whose imagination had long ago headed south (to Dante’s rough realm, the heart of <em>The Odyssey</em>, the center of <em>The Aeneid</em>, the fen of Grendel’s dam).  The answer is not, in Heaney circles and districts, so new.  The darkness has grown lighter, the light more crepuscular.  But the consideration (con-sidere: with + stars?) of last things is at once more intense and placid.  Heaney has always seemed to me unfashionably wise in matters of the heart, mortality and guilt.  He was also more than a little sly, but now the slyness seems to have brushed up against the voice of William Stafford, and the timbre is thereby altered in ways I admire.</p>
<p>The opening poem, “Had I Not Been Awake,” warned me on the threshold that the “courier blast” of wind that woke him one night would “not ever/ After” seem ordinary.  Fair enough: wind, stroke, discovery.  But then he pushes his report further, quietly, with a shiver that reminds me of the Heaney I discovered back when <em>North</em> came out.  “And not now.”  What a quiet little increment of caution, a halting of the reader who thinks he’s being given a long-term but not immediate alert.  But then that quiet little touch on the shoulder and the Cycladic smile: “And not now.”</p>
<p>My favorites in the volume include a couple of poems more directly about the sudden world-swirling stun of a stroke.  “Miracle” re-counts the New Testament verses about the invalid lowered through the roof to Jesus’ healing touch, focusing on those friends whose labor hauled him there waiting “For the burn of the paid-out ropes to cool” across their hands.  The “paid-out” is echoed in “Human Chain”’s “backbreak’s truest payback” for aid workers who have passed sacks of meal (or a fallen man) down a rescuing line.  Heaney (it seems ridiculous to say “the narrator” here) recalls the visceral experience of “A letting go which will not come again./ Or it will, once.  And for all.”  Again, the almost-afterthought touch, which gave me both a chill and a little sense of levitation.</p>
<p>This is supposed to be an abbreviated take on the book, so I’ll skip through, listing a few gems, as when an otter will “drop whatever he’s retrieved and gambol/ In pelt-sluice and unruly riverbreath.”  More penwork, “Hermit Songs,” an herbal, elegies, the magnificent “Eelworks” with its tangled glitter of syllables (“Sylph-flash made flesh”) and visceral thrill, a moonlit encounter with rifle-bearing militiamen, boilers, balers, tractors, “the violet blet” of granulated coal and an old man who could no longer stand to watch the sun going down (to report the last line of that one would be a spoiler).</p>
<p><em>Human Chain</em> is not a spoiler but a debut of the risen Heaney (I know, I know  . . .) to be savored and interrogated.  It lacks the “party piece” extended poem, the tour de force that many Irish poets see as obligatory for each sheaf, but the book’s overall spell is lasting, a whispery promise that the wind is breath, and that for the right eye, even the shadows shine.</p>

<strong><em>Miracle Boy and Other Stories</em></strong> by Pinckney Benedict  (Press 53, 2010))</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Miracle-Other-Stories-Pinckney-Benedict/dp/1935708015"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-884" title="1844712931book.qxd" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/Miracle-Boy-cover-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="161" height="243" srcset="https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/Miracle-Boy-cover-199x300.jpg 199w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/Miracle-Boy-cover.jpg 333w" sizes="(max-width: 161px) 100vw, 161px" /></a>Press 53 has done a laudable job of presenting Benedict’s new book of stories in a cleanly-packaged, affordable paperback  format – fourteen stories easy on the eye and pocketbook.  But these stories, set in rural and small-town West Virginia, are not easy on the heart or the mind.  The characters – sometimes the narrators themselves – are rife with strangeness and torqued normalcy.  They are undergoing ordeals of discovery and agony, whether they’re climbing power poles for penance, seeking out diseased livestock, creating hillbilly homunculi, transforming to other species or fending off ghosts, and Benedict’s resourceful style and wild word hoard, his sense of narrative and dramatic pace, his eye for the stunning image and the mythic insinuation make these stories spiel out like movies and like fireside tales at the same time.</p>
<p>The title story is one of the five or six that rise to the top of any stack of stories written by an American right at the tail of the last century and into this one.  Benedict’s style is loaded with expectation and suspense, but while readers wait for the <em>what-next?</em> he delivers the now with confidence and accuracy: “They will drop a salt lick in a clearing that he knows . . . by a quiet little stream, and they will wait together in the ice-rimmed bracken, squatting patiently on their haunches, Miracle Boy and his old man, to kill the deer that come to the salt.”</p>
<p>Every story manages to evoke redemption, death and transfiguration, the living quality of language when it addresses the natural and agricultural world.  You almost expect the words to become bobcats or miniature ponies, crickets or ivory-billed woodpeckers and rise from the page.  A couple of the more fanciful stories with strong sci-fi leanings (like “Zog-19: A Scientific Romance”) are not my meat, but if someone asks me what kind of stories <em>Shenandoah</em> is looking for right now, by the time I said “heart-breaking and side-splitting, ingeniously conceived and bravely, desperately written but presided over with a cunning and empathetic eye,” I’d be ready to abort the attempt and say, despite the fact that we did not publish any of these stories, “Read Pinckney Benedict.  He’s got the hot hand.”</p>

<strong><em>The Southern Poetry Anthology</em> – <em>Volume III: Contemporary Appalachia</em></strong> Edited by Jesse Graves, Paul Ruffin &amp; William Wright    (<em>Texas Review</em> Press, 2010)</p>
<p>This substantial volume (300 pages) in the ambitious Southern Poetry Anthology project will provide a welcome reservoir of poems for students of Appalachian poetry and curiosity seekers alike.  Although its parameters exclude such widely-loved bards as Byron Herbert Reece and Jesse Stuart, the collection features eighty poets, and though it may occasionally lean too far toward the inclusive (in matters of both geography and achievement), it will likely eclipse Marita Garin’s 2008 <em>Southern Appalachian Poetry</em>, which is also, in fact, limited to contemporaries but by virtue of its lack of recent work by most of the poets was obsolete almost as soon as it was published.</p>
<p>While I don’t want to debate the editors extensively on matters of who’s invited and how big a helping is on which poet’s plate, I will mention the absence of John Foster West (NC), Bettie Sellers (GA), R. H. W. Dillard (VA), Diane Gilliam Fisher (Ohion/WV) and the wonderful Jonathan Williams (NC) as disappointments, and the small bait of poems by Charles Wright is also disconcerting, though one never knows what considerations of copyright, cost and authorial quirk play a role in the shadowy negotiations of selection.</p>
<p>It’s far more useful than dwelling on the bean count to point out some of the riches of the collection.  Among the major voices here are (and one would be hard pressed to question their geographical credentials, so long as birthplace and conception site are not allowed to dictate) Fred Chappell, Kathryn Stripling Byer, Robert Morgan, George Scarbrough, Maggie Anderson and Lynn Powell, all essential to the endeavor, the last two absent from Garin’s effort.</p>
<p>And most useful of all – to mention a few poems which will make the reader consider full immersion.  Anderson’s mine disaster account “Long Story,” Byer’s low country “Drought Days” (one thirsts for more of her work here), Chappell’s “Halloween Moon Over Huddle Knob Graveyard” and Cathryn Hankla’s “Bee Tree,” these last two originally from the pages of <em>Shenandoah</em> (so curse me for consistency).  Also: Ron Rash’s small gem “Speckled Trout,” George Scarbrough’s “Firefly,” Wright’s “Celestial Waters,” David Huddle’s “Religious Life,” Michael Chitwood’s “Black Locust,” Maurice Manning’s “The Foot Washing,” Linda Parson’s Marion’s “Repossessed” with its closing “nigh as the wayward lamb to deliverance” and Judy Jordan’s “Waking in Winter.”  Just a sampler, but a fitting introduction.</p>
<p>It won’t take readers long to discover the truth of the widespread assumption that Appalachians write about religion, wild place, wildlife, family, hardship, quilting, bloodsport, the Rapture and beauty salons, but Frank X. Walker’s “Nyctophobia II,” Jennie Janeshek’s “July 1<sup>st</sup>, Thanks to Basho,” Scarbrough’s “Drouth” and Michael McPhee’s “Saint Lucy” will come as surprises.  High country poets know the high country, but not only.  They survey prospect, syntax, idiom and urban whirl and snarl with the same keen eye that watches hawks and uncles.</p>
<p>I unearthed a few typos in this book, a few errors of fact, mostly in the extensive biographical notes, a dropped stitch or two, a joist off level, but the abundance of craft and spirit on display, the sheer amplitude and spaciousness of this collection overrides any flaws I found.  For a long time readers have probably assumed that the wealth in Appalachian literature lies in its fiction – from <em>Look Homeward, Angel</em> through <em>Time Was</em> and <em>The Journey of August King</em> to <em>Cold Mountain</em> and beyond – but now perhaps a more accurate reckoning has begun, thanks to these editors.</p>
<p><strong><em>Boxing: A Cultural History</em></strong> by Kasia Boddy   (Reakton Books, 2008)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Boxing-Cultural-History-Kasia-Boddy/dp/1861894112"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-878" title="Boxing Boddy" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/Boxing-Boddy-217x300.jpg" alt="" width="154" height="213" srcset="https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/Boxing-Boddy-217x300.jpg 217w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/Boxing-Boddy.jpg 290w" sizes="(max-width: 154px) 100vw, 154px" /></a>The “sweet science” is, of course, not just a sports contest in which two men dance and dodge, pummel and skip, bleed and swell.  It has been thought of as everything from a moral test to an art, and its history runs from the metal-lined <em>caestus</em> (“sharp glove”) of Virgil to headgear and digitally monitored training methods.  Thomas Eakins photographed boxers, Langston Hughes wrote about them, someone painted them on the walls of Akrotiri, Jack London posed as one, Wallace Beery played one, Leila Ali became one, and who in the fifties did not shout and gesture during “The Friday Night Fights” on the TV box while Gillette razors were advertised by a cartoon parrot and hard-bitten announcers and writers (Bat Masterson had been one, before TV) commented and coined crisp phrases.  But what is it all about?</p>
<p>This is the larger question Kasia Brody approaches in this briskly written, informed and surprising chronicle full of photographs, poetry, testimonials, paintings and analyses of, among others, Dickens and Scorsese on the subject.  Boddy focuses on the appeal of boxing to the various aesthetic and reportorial media and the sport’s implications – as displayed in the arts – for work, race, violence, class, gender and any number of other human endeavors.  And it’s worth saying right away that this careful observer and analyst can write.  It’s an old trainer’s axiom: “whoever controls the breathing in the ring controls the fight,” and while she writes with compelling pace and shrewd momentum, Boddy has a full arsenal of tactics.  She knows when to feint or backslide, when to press forward and deliver the payload.</p>
<p>Pugilism has been examined and depicted since the arts began, and ever since <em>Punch</em> descried the outlawing of prizefighting in 1841, cultures and their artists have been interrogating themselves about the nature of squaring off and wading in.  Just a few of the hundreds of creative spirits who have entered the fray are Warhol, Fielding, Chaplin, Oates, Hogarth, Mailer, Doyle, Papa, Ellison, Hurston and Huston, Dylan (remember Hurricane?) and Ali the bee himself.  Mass culture, boxing and the representation of boxing have developed in tandem, of course, but who knew that Eliot took lessons or that Kubrick began as a boxing photographer?</p>
<p>My list is whimsical, but <em>Boxing: A Cultural History</em> is not.  Boddy uses what goes on in the ring to illuminate what goes on around it and explores the ways that artists have seen the boxer as, simultaneously, champion and scapegoat, how the vicarious and cathartic experiences of the sport (that word is seeming less and less apt) have helped shape the history of literature, painting, film.  Almost everyone has at one time been a pro, an amateur, a poseur or a spectator, and we know how the thrill and the shame of our compulsion are locked together.</p>
<p>Boddy concludes with a survey of recent fight films – <em>Raging Bull</em>, <em>The Great White Hype</em> and <em>Million Dollar Baby – </em>and I hope she’s had her say somewhere about 2010’s <em>The Fighter</em>; she seems the natural person to ask.  This hefty volume will delight both the mildly curious and scholars who read it from red frontispiece to red end papers.  One of my few regrets is that she doesn’t mention the following piece of weird artistic/pugilistic confluence and confusion.  In <em>Million Dollar Baby</em>, Clint Eastwood’s crusty Irish-American trainer Frankie Dunn tries to seize some of his cultural history beyond boxing; he’s learning to read Gaelic so that he can “improve himself” and read Yeats in the Irish.  Since Yeats wrote in English (of necessity; he didn&#8217;t have Irish), what bit of sedition was screenwriter Paul Haggis up to, <em>Mo Cuishle</em>?  I believe Boddy would have an answer for even that.</p>

<strong><em>Paper Anniversary</em></strong> by  Bobby C. Rogers   (Pittsburgh, 2010)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Paper-Anniversary-Poetry-Bobby-Rogers/dp/0822961245"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-886" title="Paper Anniversary cover" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/Paper-Anniversary-cover.jpeg" alt="" width="154" height="227" /></a>I discovered the work of Bobby Rogers about two years ago (late to the trough again), and the unembellished truth is that his poetry lifts me.  There’s something of Whitman in these long-lined, free associating narratives, Old Walt’s omnivorous style and his candid admiration of workers, but this poet stops short of the operatic overkill that crops up in his forebears.  Rogers is not at all reluctant to mix into his shrewdly-directed rambles the stuff of books – Faulkner or Marx, Language Poetry, Eliot – and the local runs through these poems, the tracks of the L &amp; N, fifths of Old Carter, fences and paint stripping, good setters, knives and knaves, Johnny and June, a house party in Dyersburg, Tennessee.  All with robust grace and an admirable candor.  Rogers is the first poet to come down the pike in a long time and remind me of the wide net and keen eye, sharp tongue and good groove of Rodney Jones, which is no small thing.  Yet Rogers is his own man, a little less acerbic and prone to revel in the academic swamp than Jones.</p>
<p><em>Paper Anniversary</em> is wholly itself, all the poems issuing forth from a central voice, consciousness, ethos, and as I said, it lifts me.  Rogers knows how to close a deal, pulling many incidents and details into a poem, then closing with “the closed wound shines” or “a few short scenes that won’t go dim.”  His humor is quiet, and though the echo of tragedy is never too far from his melody, his words promise that some will endure and thrive.</p>
<p>Though I’m a great fan of “Meat and Three,” set in a joint where you can get a good plate lunch, sweet tea, good talk and hints of the miraculous lurking in the commonplace, my favorite poem in the collection is the second one, “Arkansas Stone,” which looks hard at knives and the perfect device for honing them, at family knives, nicked knives, Sunday knives and swapped knives, bringing together the usual information and some obscure mineral data.  The narrator reports his grandfather’s understanding, perhaps learned from the craft of sharpening, that “these lives we’re given are made mostly of waiting/ and incremental wear and a life’s work of standing up/ against it.”  Like many of Rogers’ poems, this one operates with lines of over a dozen syllables and scant rhyme but feels more formal and reminds me how rightness and precision and concentration make a formality of their own which can make you feel like you’re reading neatly-sculpted (but flexible) heroic couplets.  “Who would ever say a knife/,” he asks, “is not a work of art, so precisely made and perfectly/ folded, so blissfully singular of purpose?”  And who would say that a poem is not a knife?</p>
<p>It seems politic, when commending a book so enthusiastically to note its shortcomings, so it won’t sound like you have an iron in the fire or have been asked for a blurb.  Fair enough.  Shortcomings?  A substantial length for poetry, but <em>Paper Anniversary</em> ’s not long enough to suit me.</p>

<strong><em>True Grit</em> </strong>by Charles Portis  (Overlook, 1968)</p>
<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/True-Grit-portis.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-879" title="True Grit portis" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/True-Grit-portis.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="261" /></a>Why recommend a slender novel, a quirky “cowboy story,” so many have read already and so many more have seen in one or both of the film treatments?  Different as the two mediums are, all the best lines and scenes in either movie, the tensions and rhythm and alternating dread and catharsis, are right out of the book, a reminder that, even in the matter of movies, somebody has to write the thing.  Somebody has to pen, type or key in all those words.  And the covenant between creator (or creative team) and consumer is different; in a book, the receiver has much more control over the pace of his/her own progress through the story.  Publishers have long known that type size and style, margins, page size and so on play a role in how the book is read, but the reader’s own preferences play a more prominent role, and the writer of prose has only the resources of language to guide those reader habits and needs.</p>
<p>It’s tempting to read <em>True Grit</em> at a gallop.  The simplest elements of the plot – felony and pursuit, the journey, the mis-match of the avenging party complicated by alcohol, cussedness and a tight weave of affection and disdain, then the climax and downhill denouement – make it a page-turner.  The characters, as everyone now knows, are eccentric/comic/loveable/irascible or full-bore scurrilous or all of the above, the comedy merciless, the dialogue clean and taut as Leo Kottke’s strings.</p>
<p>The great feat of the story is to deliver this tale in a credibly archaic version on an old woman’s voice reminiscing on a long-ago pilgrimage, t accomplish this and still prevent it from sounding like a stunt or an imitation Huck.  Portis manages this with surprising vernacular phrases, understatement, a refusal to reach for high rhetoric without wrapping it in irony or any false determination to move the story forward.  Readers and viewers alike remember LaBoeuf’s “A saucy manner does not go down with me,” Tom Chaney’s “Everything is against me.  Now I am shot by a child,” one-eyed Rooster’s “If it ain’t loaded and cocked, it won’t shoot,” Mattie’s stoicism, her insistence on being treated as equal to an adult male and her skewering use of Biblical phrases like “The wicked flee where none pursueth.”  The difference between the media is that the reader gets to say all these words aloud, to taste them on the tongue and feel them in the whole vocal apparatus.  In novel form, <em>True Grit</em> invites oral performance, and indelible as the voices of the Duke and the Dude are, the pleasures of audition may be secondary to the pleasures of participation.  I believe it’s no spoiler to promise great satisfaction when the reader or re-reader, with the whole weight of 224 pages behind her or him says, “This ends my account of how I avenged Frank Ross’s blood over in the Choctaw nation when snow was on the ground.”</p>
<p>And in the best interest of Portis, Mattie, yourself and Donna Tartt, don’t bother to Ms. Tartt’s “Afterward.”</p>

<strong><em>Saints and Sinners</em></strong> by Edna O’Brien (Little Brown &amp; Co., 2011)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Saints-Sinners-Stories-Edna-OBrien/dp/0316122726"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-892" title="saints and sin cover" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/saints-and-sin-cover-198x300.jpg" alt="" width="178" height="269" srcset="https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/saints-and-sin-cover-198x300.jpg 198w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/saints-and-sin-cover.jpg 220w" sizes="(max-width: 178px) 100vw, 178px" /></a>Edna O’Brien ranks high on my list of contemporary writers primarily due to her lyrical, mischievous and explosive short stories, which in their precision and economy, their deftly rendered characters and profound empathy resemble that other great Irish contemporary William Trevor.  O’Brien’s imagination, however, often takes a more gothic turn than Trevor’s, and the troubled lives her protagonists lead are often far from the quiet desperation of her countryman’s creations.  Whether writing about ardor, labor, class, crime, feud, immigration or sectarian violence, this author of two dozen previous books is always perceptive and provocative.  Her carefully-shaped dramas, in addition to the variety of narrative approaches and the range of tones and subjects in her newest collection, <em>Saints and Sinners</em>, confirm her status as a master of the form.</p>
<p>“Shovel Kings,” the first of these eleven stories, follows the enigmatic behavior of an Irishman – “a man on whom permanent frost had settled” – working in London.  Although the author presents a lively spectrum of Irish types making do at the bottom of the various pecking orders abroad, its sociological agenda outweighs the fictive current, and it’s not a wholly satisfying story.  Fortunately, most of the subsequent offerings outshine it.</p>
<p>In “Sinners” the landlady Delia – whose apprehension of the sensual world is ambiguous and unsettled, “whose heart had walled up long ago” – discovers evidence that the couple and “daughter” lodging with her are not what they seem and are up to some private mischief, which shocks Delia but also triggers speculations and dreams which shake her own protocols of repression.  As is common in O’Brien’s work, the surprising and challenging narration provides little encouragement for the reader to judge either the transgressive guests or the host who cannot quite sustain righteous indignation.</p>
<p>Few writers have learned as much from Molly Bloom’s soliloquy as O’Brien, and the articulate but distressed Mildred of “Madame Cassandra” reveals a Joycean stream-of-consciousness as she attempts to understand the decay of love’s bliss, treachery, nostalgia and the refuge of small mercies.  Nearly half the stories in the collection address such marriage wars and their collateral conflicts.  “Black Flower, for instance, accounts with dark economy a tryst within a dangerous context.  This story’s narrator is taken with a newly-released political prisoner – “Shane,” ironically, “visible to all in his new jeans and jazzy shirt.”  Though the reader expects matters to go awry, it’s impossible to be prepared for the story’s resolution.</p>
<p>The narrator in the brief apocalyptic narrative “Plunder” reports the reverberating horrors of displacement and mortal danger in a fashion more reminiscent of Joyce Carol Oates than James Joyce, and though it’s on the extreme border of O’Brien’s territory, it’s chillingly rendered and breath-stealing, as at the end the survivor sets out, realizing, “Many and terrible are the roads to home.”</p>
<p>My favorite piece, “Inner Cowboy,” concerns a young man, admittedly not the sharpest knife in the drawer, whose employer leads him into moral dilemmas he’s ill-equipped to address.  Curley lives in a gloomy small town, surviving on his misunderstandings and secrets, until the greedy industrialists grow careless and Curly is forced into an inescapable vise.  The author extends full sympathy to the unfortunate protagonist, but she will not rescue him from the pervasive ruthlessness.</p>
<p>Class, privilege and their absence fuel “Green Georgette” and “Manhattan Medley,” the first a little girl’s understated but heart-rending attempts to understand inflexible pecking orders, and the second a less compelling story about abuse of leisure and luxury.  I felt myself straining to empathize with the narrator of the latter but never managed the negotiation.</p>
<p>Miss Gilhooley, known to her familiars as “the Spinster,” is smitten with a famous poet in “Send My Roots Rain” and has arranged, at last, to meet him in a swanky restaurant.   Like Katherine Mansfield’s Miss Brill, she learns how little she is counted by others, but her disappointments and adjustments are telegraphed fairly early in the story, and the one pleasure of the unfolding is the topography of her desperate mind.</p>
<p>The splendid “Old Wounds” is a true Irish tragedy about the survivors of families who went from friendship to feud over a slight.  It’s full of the caution and quiet suffering of those whose mistrust and covertness lead to misunderstanding and cruelty.  The two middle-aged survivors have a chance at reconciliation, but a dispute about a gravesite intervenes.  What follows is the account of yet another passive-aggressive tug-of-war between a voluble, hopeful Irish woman and a taciturn man, a negotiation O’Brien takes as crucial.  The story includes a jarring inaccuracy uncharacteristic of this author, as the narrator describes shotgun shells as “brass bullets.”  Precise as O’Brien usually is about the world’s details, as well as more complex matters of human psychology, it’s a shock to find a slip.</p>
<p>Seamus Heaney has praised O’Brien’s writing for “the sensation it gives of the world made new by language.”  Even if these stories were not compelling for their sure-footed plotting, arresting characters and evident passion for humans in travail, they would be worth reading for their sheer sad melodies – “home to the loamy land and the brown-black lakes fed from the bog water, home to the churchyard grounds, and home to the intangible white mist.”  Landscape, mindscape, soulscape – O’Brien knows them and sings them all.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>[There are conventional reasons not to tout the next two books: both authors are colleagues, so some might cry “foul,” “conflict of interest,” as if that phrase doesn’t describe nearly every breath and thought.   But when someone writes well and memorably, I prefer to say so, accompanied when necessary by caveats and disclosures such as this, rather than to punish with silence.]</p>

<strong><em>School for Tricksters</em></strong> by Chris Gavaler (SMU, 2011)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/School-Tricksters-Stories-Chris-Gavaler/dp/0870745638"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-880" title="trickster_cover" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/trickster_cover.jpg" alt="" width="160" height="240" /></a>Of what value are occasional poems, a poet’s ephemera, and what does one who has outlived his or her creative gifts become?  These are among the unlikely and highly pertinent questions raised in a book that probes cultural identity, primarily by bringing back to its early life the Carlisle Indian School with all its cross-stitched peculiarities and unforgettable cultural kaleidoscope of denizens.  In the story “<em>Sports Illustrated</em> Interviews Marianne Moore” Chris Gavaler delves into this set of  concerns less than crucial to a public that has long ago turned away from Moore and her cohorts to find out what Charlie Sheen is tweeting and what sort of trouble the Kardashians or Cardassians are stirring up for Jean-Luc Picard.  But Gavaler loads the interview with elemental issues that assail and enrich all of our lives: how we are insiders and outsiders at once, indigenous and invented, prejudiced and curious, wise and foolish.  While the reporter flaunts his assumptions about the “savage” nature of the Indians Miss Moore taught at Carlisle, she quietly scolds, guides, deceives and evades him.  Once the aptly-named Cantwell leaves with what he is sure is “the story,” Gavaler hands the podium over to Moore behind her locked door, revisiting her past and trying to be certain she – suffragist and socialist who tried to conduct genuine dialogue with the students and found them “beautiful, unfathomable” – was not guilty in the matter of reshaping their identities, as she worked to provide them with armor against unscrupulous whites.</p>
<p>The book also circles around the figure of Jim Thorpe, Carlisle’s most famous “student-athlete” and “Pop” Warner, it’s most notorious coach, but they’re neither the narrative nor moral center of the book, though from the cover art, someone sees Thorpe as the hook.</p>
<p>The bulk of the episodes (it’s called a “novel in stories,” but I don’t feel the story shape in most chapters, which bothers me not at all in this context) concern Sylvester and Ivy, students at the Carlisle school under false pretenses.  But then who isn’t operating under false guises?  As the narrator says, “Everybody wears costumes.”  Ivy Miller is one of these faux-redskins, and she’s a convincingly rendered and motivated character, but it’s her cohort Sylvester Long whose exploits and conflicts really captivate me.  Whether scamming his way into the school, tracking a lost girl (that, too, riddled with deception) or losing his virginity, Sylvester’s progress through education and on into assimilation keeps me turning the pages.</p>
<p>Gavaler produces hard-working prose, thrifty and precise, and he doesn’t shy away from difficulty.  Challenging as it is to write post-coital feeling and conversation, the author manages it, as the Negro-Cherokee-Blackfeet-who-knows-what-? Sylvester and the soiled dove Hazel avoid coarseness, glibness or anything resembling misty sentiment.  Right after the last sexual shiver and release, when she asks Sylvester where he got a scar on his hip, he responds, “A horse . . . at a county fair.  I was, I don’t know, maybe ten I think.  Came up on me out of nowhere, knocked up the hip pretty bad.”  Considering the context, this memory of a bad ride and involuntary dismount could be sly or comic, but the author moves on, doesn’t wink, doesn’t take the easy angle.</p>
<p>Gavaler does that, moves on, instead of milking the already-loaded situations.  Although his book is full of chicanery and desperate imposture, this writer isn’t faking as he examines the inner workings of human transformation, a subject few can trump.  With <em>School for Tricksters</em> in hand, it’s a hard prospect to consider that SMU is discontinuing its fiction series, a decision the decision-makers may not even be wise enough to regret.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Good Daughter</em></strong> by Jasmine Darznik    (Grand Central, 2011)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Good-Daughter-Memoir-Mothers-Hidden/dp/0446534978"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-882" title="the-good-daughter" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/the-good-daughter-197x300.gif" alt="" width="163" height="249" srcset="https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/the-good-daughter-197x300.gif 197w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/61/files/2011/03/the-good-daughter.gif 200w" sizes="(max-width: 163px) 100vw, 163px" /></a>“I was eleven years old and already I understood shame and secrecy, pride and resourcefulness,” writes Darznik in this intriguing twist on the memoir genre.  Darznik is Iranian-American and not the first female in her family to understand these four qualities in her list.  Her mother and grandmother broke convention for their own survival and that of their daughters and took risks almost unimaginable one and two generations ago.  Darznik explores the source of her own identity by recounting the lives of Kobra and Lili, information gleaned from tapes sent by the latter, who feels her history too difficult to speak it.  With the ear of a faithful amanuensis and the eye of a novelist, Darznik weaves and unweaves this sensuous tale of life in Iran (or perhaps “the Irans”) which few American even suspect.</p>
<p>Some aspects of the story will of course strike many American readers as exotic, the atmosphere created by spices and silks, fruit and the Persian language, but interwoven with tradition Iranian culture are the growing influences of the western world, the resulting alloy sculpted in fascinating prose and infused with those eternal verities like pity and sacrifice.  At the center of the story is a fourteen-year-old girl’s disastrous marriage, her bewilderment and fear giving way to resolve and independence.</p>
<p>The story’s storm also has a second eye, not altogether unlike Sophie’s choice, as a shadowy other daughter’s existence comes to haunt both Lili and the author, but before this dynamic arises the memoir navigates through spousal abuse, alcoholism, drug overdose, escapes and banishments, bazaars and denials, luxurious bathhouses, a fourth-hand sewing machine, pistachio orchards and rites of passage, not to mention storytelling itself and the mysterious actions of <em>qesmet</em> (destiny, and nothing like the Broadway concept of kismet).</p>
<p>The three generations of women whose chronicle this volume elucidates live within that dangerous territory of “interesting times,” and while Darznik lovingly describes and animates the life of a mercurial extended family, she makes it clear that adaptation is a crucial ingredient in the education of these women who also become midwife, seamstress, beautician, while fulfilling the full range of domestic responsibilities and keeping the current of language, humor, outrage and loyalty running clear, though not without set pieces like the following, which indicates the grace and liveliness which characterizes Darznik’s style:</p>
<p>It was then, in springtime, that the <em>kolis</em> – the Gypsy girls – came down from the mountains to the city with their arms full of branches from the mulberry trees.  They had coal-black eyes and hennaed hands.  Silver flashed at their throats, their wrists, and their ankles.  Their plaits swung out from under their bright, patterned kerchiefs and their long, flounced skirts skimmed the ground as they walked.</p>
<p>Despite the temptations to linger in such moments, Darznik practices restraint and remains true to her larger purpose, to convey the complex lives of women in a changing and often hostile environment and to shape her own memories and dreams into a beautiful and challenging journey few readers will regret sharing with her.</p>

<p>The long summer twilight filters through the leaves of the birch trees in the front yard, throws lacy patterns on the yellow walls of the bedroom. In a jar next to my bed, the fireflies my brother and I caught earlier in the evening crawl up and down the glass, their light gradually fading. The dormer window, an eye onto the open world, frames swallows winging past. Through the wall, I hear my mother crying, my father’s low tones. But this is better than last time, when they fought in my room and I pretended to be sleeping. And it will be better than next time, my eighth birthday, when I will fall asleep to the sound of their arguing and wake to find that it’s snowed during the night and my mother is gone. Giant icicles hang from the eaves, break free and plunge into the drifts. Until I leave for college—and even sometimes now, at twilight, or just before I wake—she is heels clicking down the sidewalk, a dark-haired woman turning away to light a cigarette.</p>
<p>You and I met in Bangkok, there to report on the refugees flooding in from Myanmar. It was a year later, when we went to Havana to write about people who’d tried to escape, that we found out I was expecting. I’d filed the story and you’d finished taking the photos; we were talking over lukewarm Cristal beers in the dingy, deserted hotel dining room. “In spite of how things might seem, history doesn’t have to repeat itself,” you told me.  We went walking along the Malecon promenade next to the sea. A storm was rising: clouds scudded across the sky in the time-lapse photography that was one of your specialties, the illusion of quick forward movement. Waves crashed over the sea wall onto the road. <em>Move back</em>, a policeman shouted, <em>es muy peligroso</em>. But we stayed where we were, you with your arm tight around me, telling me everything would be all right, the salt water cascading over us, starfish and seaweed tangling in my hair, the hair of a woman washed up from a shipwreck.</p>
<p>I live alone now in Japan, a place that suits me, an island country of walls made from stone, frosted glass, paper screens, glances, what is left unsaid. I couldn’t write any more about the nomads of the earth, so instead I travel around Japan reporting on mountain fire festivals, regional seafood specialties, the best traditional inns. Winter is my favorite season: the mournful song of the <em>yaki-imo</em> sweet potato vendor winds through the streets; snow slips with soft thuds from the stone lantern in the garden; rows of red-aproned <em>jizo</em> statues at the neighborhood temple are visible through the bare trees. The bodhisattva Jizo protects dead children as they travel through the underworld, the temple priest told me. It was as if he knew I’d decided to have the abortion after we returned from Havana, or like he knew something about my past, the way summer can turn to winter. Every day at twilight an old woman, her hair still black, shuffles up the stone walkway with an offering for the <em>jizos</em>: a pinwheel, candy. The priest has never seen her, but I know she is there. In the long hours of night, when I can’t sleep, I visit the <em>jizos</em> and make my own offerings: a lullaby, or sometimes just words. <em>Salt, snow, firefly</em>. Then I walk the city, lose myself in the indigo canyons of evening.</p>
<p>The last time I saw you, we were at the apartment you kept in Paris, the walk-up in the Marais where you stayed between shoots. Blue storm light spilled in through the tall windows; children ran laughing and shouting in the park, their calls twisting away in the wind, voices from my childhood. You talked about communication, about love and trust. I turned away, lit a cigarette. Stared into the lowering blue. Why hadn’t I kept quiet? You’d always said we could weather anything and I’d wanted to believe you, but the ties we have to other people were, after all, too tenuous. The understanding hopelessly incomplete. A random memory swam around, surfaced. “In Havana, I learned that in Spanish there are different words for ‘inner’ and ‘outer’ wall,” I said, turning to face you. “<em>Pared</em> means inner, and <em>muro</em> is outer.” You gazed at me with . . . compassion? Pity? Hatred? After a long silence, you said, “There’s a wall around your heart.” I saw the wall then: stone, encircling, with ramparts. Sightseers walking along the top, marveling at the great pulsing heart at the center. Shaking their heads in wonder, murmuring to one another: <em>Who ever really knows what we are capable of accomplishing?</em> But you see, that wall is a good thing. Some people don’t realize that we need walls to survive. Without them, we’re animals set free, huddling together in the middle of the open plain; we’re words begging for the form of a sonnet, a prayer. It’s something I’ve always known, a lesson I’m lucky to have learned early in life.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My knees recall a watery buckle whenever I remember my encounters with snakes, their undulations across my path, their many permutations. Once, in early summer I nearly stumbled upon an adolescent copperhead a foot long and as big around as a dime. It had moved into my storage shed, following the food chain. When I saw it, I did something without thinking.</p>
<p>LAST WEEK I was out spit-shining the country property because it’s on the market. Picking up the last remnants of shriveled oak leaves wedged between the heat pump and the house, I had one of those very human moments when you find yourself alone surrounded by nature. There’s a certain stillness I’ve come to recognize that means you are being watched. The human is object not subject; the gaze of nature turns back, or the silence of nature is held in suspense as you stumble into it. Late autumn chilled the air, and just past my left foot a young copperhead lazed on a warm orangey-brown slab of flagstone, perfect cover for the snake, as rock and snake share the same mottled color. The snake’s head tensed up, sensing in my direction. I glanced to check its pupils and confirmed that they were elliptical like a cat’s. There was no mistaking this narrow fellow for a<br />
nonpoisonous variety.</p>
<p>The copperhead was very near, but I worked my way around it without scaring it off. Stealthy in my motions, I dashed inside for my chef’s knife, afraid the snake might slither too far off if I trekked all the way to the shed for a hoe. The knife was one of those heavy cleaver jobs best wielded by professional cooks that amateurs keep in their kitchens for inspiration. My chef’s knife had come with a German-honed set, and so far I’d only used the paring knife.</p>
<p>Leaving out the details, I used the big chopper on the copperhead, knowing they usually travel in pairs and hoping this one was still young enough to be dating around, but old enough to have wandered far from its nest. Seeing it so close to the foundation gave me a shiver. I wasn’t certain where it had nested.</p>
<p>I wish I could say that I regret having done it, but the last thing I need is some potential buyer getting spooked as he walks up the stairs to the back deck. I genuinely hate that I killed it without even a nod to the big picture of the life cycle of all of us creatures here below, but I have to accept that I prefer the snake’s death to the possible theft of a customer. This is probably a good sign that it really is time for me to leave country living behind. When I first moved from the suburbs, I was not capable of killing a mouse, let alone a snake. I carried all ladybugs and stinkbugs outside, leaving the spiders be and puzzling over the ants, large and small. Clearly, country living has not been the constant pastoral, the peaceable kingdom I once imagined. And I’m not necessarily more peace loving for having experienced its conditions. The first thing I saw when I moved to the country was a bunch of slaughtered hogs hanging on big hooks at the side of a barn. My new neighbors smiled and waved as I drove by.</p>
<p>THE DICTIONARY PROVIDES that our North American copperhead appears after Copernicus and before its capitalized variation. Copperhead was a derisive appellation applied to anti-Lincoln “Peace Democrats,” northerners sympathetic to the South during the Civil War. The Knights of the Golden Circle was a Copperhead secret society. It’s a term I&#8217;d never heard until I consulted Webster’s to begin my elementary education beyond what practical experience had already taught me about a certain serpent: copperheads live in rocky areas and favor thick underbrush; they eat small warm-blooded mammals for the most part, but will eat aquatic life and insects if pressed. How small were those mammals? I wondered. Most active in late afternoon and early evening, copperheads can grow to four feet in length, but average two. I cling to averages. That last fact bothered me a good deal.</p>
<p>Now we hear that snakes originally walked around on numerous feet, that there was no slither to the snake primeval. Snake derives from what it means to crawl. I can&#8217;t help but picture snakes on all fours scuttling across the floor. It gives me a funny image of the fall of man in the Garden of Eden. Was it more like a centipede that tempted Eve? Not much of story. I prefer my dog or cat, familiar mammals with furry paws.</p>
<p>The coloration of copperheads approaches hazel with chestnut brown markings. Bands taper across their spines like saddlebags or the hourglass. Shadows speckle their pinkish to white underbellies, and, yes, they do sport blunt-nosed copper-colored heads that taper like arrows on narrow necks. Aside from their slit eyes, the arrow shape of the head also means poison.</p>
<p>The rubbery oblong eggs I found in the rock pile along the drive were those of the black snake, famous for climbing trees. I’ve watched one wrap my nearest jack oak, spiraling gradually toward a nest to filch eggs or baby birds. A few times I tried to unwrap it from the trunk on its way up and managed to toss it into the brush with my walking stick, but the black snake always came right back, persistently after chirps in the high tree branches. I knew black snakes were good for eating rodents and for keeping away the poisonous snakes, so I didn’t disturb the eggs I found sprinkled in the rocks.</p>
<p>Copperheads are born live and emerge from a viscous pool of something akin to the primordial soup. I’ve seen copperhead afterbirth shimmering with alien hieroglyphics, black words scribbled in eight-inch snakes at the center of the goo. Until I saw this, I thought they came out of eggs.</p>
<p>ONLY AFTER I tossed my shed intruder by its tail out of reflex with one garden-gloved hand did I learn another salient fact, or maybe two: 1) I had done something foolish, and 2) As we sat around a table deep into dinner conversation much later in the summer, one of my companions reported that her husband had discovered a young copperhead in their house and been advised by the county extension agent to swiftly kill it, because the babies come equipped with a more lethal supply of venom than their parents.</p>
<p>Venom means the snakes’ survival and ignorance of it perhaps my death. I downed some more wine as I considered my luck at not having been bitten. My foolish left hand quivered in my lap with my napkin. I had twirled that little sucker from under my feet without a second&#8217;s hesitation. This is probably what ultimately led me to chop the autumnal copperhead in two with the chef’s knife several years later. I’m not really out for nature’s blood. I believe in karma and try not to create the bad sort. I know enough to stop and think about what goes around.</p>
<p>After having flung it far from me with one hand, I found my little copperhead the following day, edging a kindling box in the very same shed, perched with head up sensing the air when I disturbed its lair for my garden tools. I determined then to reorganize the kindling, to destroy the snake&#8217;s habitat or hunting ground instead of the snake. I spent the better part of a steamy summer afternoon dumping boxes of wood into a plastic garbage can I situated behind the shed and firmly lidded. Something I&#8217;ve learned by experience is how attractive copperheads find wood, especially stacked lumber or firewood where mice nest. Everyone loves to hang out in the kitchen.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve not seen that very snake since, but I do not fail to give a stomp on the shed floor before grabbing or replacing a tool. I peer up into the rafters, even though I&#8217;ve heard that copperheads do not climb, because I&#8217;ve seen them sunning atop lumber piles, and I doubt they make fine distinctions.</p>
<p>“WELL, WELL!” CONCLUDED Max O’Rell, upon discovering that the snake he thought he was in bed with, in a rural town in Australia, was really his trusted walking stick: “Is it possible for a man to be such a fool!” (“My First Snake,” <em>The Ladies’ Home Journal</em>, 1894). Since our very first encounter, copperheads have had a tendency to make me look and feel stupid. As a consequence, I do not trust them to behave as they should. Before I entered first grade, I could tell a snake from a worm and had seen a copperhead wriggling along the floor of our foyer. It confounded me, but not because I did not recognize it for what it was. My own reptile brain was hard wired for recoil even though I could not correctly pronounce its name. I was left with another mumbled word that was almost as unwieldy in my mouth, since I had trouble with W&#8217;s, too. After running outside, I announced to my mother, who was busy sunbathing, as people in the sixties felt justified in doing, that there was &#8220;a big worm&#8221; in the house. She urged me to just pick it up and throw it out the door.</p>
<p>I was not a squeamish child, but luckily my instincts – better then than now – did not allow me to follow her instruction. Instead, I bravely called my older sister out of her sacred room, away from her oil painting and teenage rumination, but by then the snake, or &#8220;nake,&#8221; as I called it, had fled. Despite the amusement that usually followed my struggles with pronunciation, I told my sister about the snake in my own language, but that only made me look like an idiot or a liar. Where was it now? And I was scared, too, because unlike my mother and sister, I knew what I had seen had been no simple worm, and I vigilantly kept watch for the viper to turn up under someone&#8217;s feet. For weeks I checked my shoes before I tied them on.</p>
<p>I WAS CLOSER with my &#8220;worm&#8221; than I knew at the time, at least closer to Norse legends of the Midgard-Worm that girds the earth, its tail in its mouth, endlessly cycling through the yin-yang of oppositions. I think it was a long time before I saw another copperhead, with only harmless black snakes and their lost skins in between. Those freshly sloughed sheaths – glimmering on the grass, drying out on stone patios, lying decorously in flowerbeds or carried down the attic stairs of my new house over the shoulder of the home inspector – have never failed to attract and hold my attention. Some of those shed skins have been intact and very long, like giant transparent bean pods the texture of cellophane, something like a mask waiting for a dancer to peer back through its vacant eye-holes. You could pour the snake back in to fill its old skin, I think. But, of course, you cannot. No more than you can turn back time.</p>
<p>Last summer I found a dead black snake tangled in the plastic netting of my pond, its skin split where it tried to force itself backward to escape. Seeing inside the peeled snake filled me with guilt. The netting I had laid to protect the fish from raccoons, and tortoises from falling into the water and drowning, had caught and held the snake fast. There are obviously greater forces at work than our individual intentions, good or bad.</p>
<p>The backward push of the snake in its panic reminds me of a recurring nightmare I had for years, in which I had to drive a speeding car with my view restricted to the rearview mirror. I had to try to anticipate what lay ahead from what was just behind. Twists and hair-raising turns lay ahead, to which I was blind. It makes my stomach tense just to write this down. Eventually I’d wake up, wrecking the car.</p>
<p>“Don’t look back,” said Satchel Page.  “Something might be gaining on you.”</p>
<p>Indeed. And there is nothing back there that’s going to help you guess where this road goes next.</p>
<p>I&#8217;VE HEARD ABOUT black snakes that share living space with human households, plopping in a polite way onto cool, kitchen linoleum after everyone has gone to bed. A friend of mine who rented a renovated log cabin had an infestation of black snakes in her walls that started in her underwear drawer. It was rather a long story that made her shiver to tell, which eventually led to a thousand dollars of damage to her truck when she moved out of her cabin in the middle of the night in a thunderstorm as snakes slithered from the walls and ceiling.</p>
<p>According to the Gnostics, we&#8217;ve snakes to thank for wresting knowledge from the gods. But if I am to restrict the limits of my life story in snakes to first-hand accounts, I have only a few snakes left to tell about, aside from the six-foot timber rattler that buzzed across a hiking trail (no real story there); the several black snakes I’ve already mentioned that I unwrapped from summer tree limbs with my walking stick and tossed out of range to protect wren and barn swallow nests; the many black snake lodgers in the giant oak, inside its rotten trunk and among its gnarled roots, at the camp where I go each summer to teach; and certain others worth only short reports, encountered with mere glimpses, stepped over and forgotten. The sight of a black snake climbing up the wall of your house can do wonders for adrenaline, but it’s probably not going to bite you unless you tangle with it, and even then you won’t die.</p>
<p>WHEN I SAW a copperhead in my rental house west of Lexington, Virginia, I had no doubt about its identification, although I duly described the color and markings over the phone to my Indiana Jones-type friend in an attempt at denial.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep, you&#8217;ve got yourself a full-grown copperhead,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I can get there in an hour or so. Just leave it alone and shut off the room.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like I was going to stand there and poke it with a stick. I did what he suggested, but I had to reenter my bedroom to dress.</p>
<p>In the early 1990’s I was living in a renovated granary. I&#8217;d been outside taking a shower, the inaugural outdoor shower of the year, on an unusually warm Mother&#8217;s Day afternoon. I&#8217;d come back into the bedroom and had seen something stir in the closet. All I saw at first was motion. I&#8217;m nearsighted and had left my glasses on the dresser before padding outside. I donned them, still wearing nothing but a towel, and the snake came into focus out of the dimness. There was no door on the closet, just a rod where I&#8217;d not hung a curtain. The copperhead was coiled, head up at the ready, imitating every image of a giant cobra I’d ever seen. I guess it had sensed my approach and was poised to defend its claim on the great indoors. I was its swami, my wet head wrapped in a towel. It looked large, thicker than the lower part of my arm just above the wrist. Before I called my Indiana Jones, who lived near Charlottesville, I had called everyone I knew in town but had gotten only one answering machine after another. I figured everyone was out having dinner with their mothers, while I was caught here with a snake. On some level, I suppose it served me right. Oh, Swami.</p>
<p>I rattled a few drawers looking for clothes, trying all the while to keep an eye on the viper. It slowly changed position, and I went to the closet to investigate in time to see it glide behind a stack of shoeboxes. True to form, it was just trying to escape.</p>
<p>I was glad it proved shy, but I was disgusted, too. “Great,” I thought, “after my Indiana Jones drives an hour to rescue me, the damn snake will be gone.” The least it could do after making me feel so vulnerable was to stick around long enough to validate my story.</p>
<p>I closed the bedroom door to be safe, but I didn&#8217;t expect my visitor to return. The snake had no stake in my credibility. It wouldn’t be the first or last time a snake made a fool out of me. I amused myself by imagining the copperhead coiled over my flip-flops or pumps. After all, it had shown an interest in my shoes.</p>
<p>Sleuthing for a slithery trail, I rounded the barn that was my house and found an array of loose boards stacked against the closet’s exterior wall. Soon I located what I thought was the copperhead’s entry point, a gap in the foundation near the ground.</p>
<p>While I awaited my rescuer, I made a quick trip to the grocery store for steaks. I wasn&#8217;t going to drag my friend all this way over a mountain for nothing. The least I could do was throw something worthwhile on the grill.</p>
<p>Indiana pulled up in his truck equipped with a hoe, some bludgeoning logs and his wild animal scat book. We started our safari in the closet. He pulled out my shoeboxes and uncovered the offending hole.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stuff some steel wool in that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As I gave him the inside tour of everywhere the snake had been, I strategically mentioned the steaks. Then I led him around to the side of the house, where I&#8217;d circled several times already, nosing around the lumber pile and searching for more entry points.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t move,&#8221; Indiana said. &#8220;Just back out slowly.&#8221;</p>
<p>I backed out and stopped about ten feet from the stacked lumber, hunched over and focused on the ground. Then I threw my glance toward the wood. Shoulder high, or where my head had bowed but a moment before, sprawled the copperhead, all three feet of it. Forget averages. My stomach lurched as I counted the number of times I&#8217;d stood exactly on or near that spot in the last hour and a half. Yes, if it had been a snake . . . . Indiana informed me that unlike other snakes copperheads give no warning before striking. They hold their ground and lunge if cornered, but generally inject less venom than other poisonous varieties that give warning gestures.</p>
<p>I was breathing hard when I asked, &#8220;What do you think we should do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Indiana didn’t hesitate. “Kill it. It knows its way inside now, and it&#8217;ll keep hanging around.”</p>
<p>I must have looked distressed or afraid.</p>
<p>“They mate, you know. Why don&#8217;t you start the charcoal,” he added with sympathy.</p>
<p>I did as I was told and never asked where he pitched the dead snake. He did say it was as tough as old shoe leather and hard to kill. I told everyone about his chivalry and derring-do. I kept thinking about Bruce Dern, though, in the film &#8220;Tattoo,&#8221; with his skin so completely obscured by patterns and designs that he ended up evoking a reptile. But my Indiana was just a regular, transplanted Yankee, with a penchant for trail wear, leather bomber jackets and nature writing.</p>
<p>UNFORTUNATELY, INDIANA WASN’T the only gentleman I had to recruit to kill a copperhead while I was living in that barn. Instead of being a genuine nature lover, the next one was enrolled at the university&#8217;s law school. I think I would have fared better with a medical student, who would at least have had an affinity for the caduceus. This law student had nothing more in mind than a few lazy weeks of R&amp;R house-sitting at the Big Farm House, not engaging in jungle warfare at the converted barn below. Law students and lawyers, in my experience, are generally tired or nervous most of the time. All of that left-brainiac stuff of building arguments out of human nature makes them fall into a light coma the minute they sit down.</p>
<p>On a Sunday evening in hot July, I was sitting on the stairs that led down to my kitchen, sweating, with my portable phone pressed to my ear, chatting away long distance when I happened to gaze toward the stove. At first I wasn&#8217;t sure what had caught my attention, but a few seconds later I saw a vibrating tongue and then a head emerge at floor level. No mistaking the slit eyes, the anvil head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Copperhead!&#8221; I announced, into the phone.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a copperhead under my stove.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re shitting me,&#8221; my city friend said.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I gotta go,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Damn, it just disappeared.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the previous long winter months, I’d caught all manner of rodents – brown field mice with white feet, grey, smaller-eared house mice, and chubby, stubby-tailed, squint-eyed voles. I started by catching them in Havahart traps. Catch and release. But that sentiment didn’t last through November.</p>
<p>After clearing out all the items from the cabinet beside the stove, I lined it with various death-dealing devices. Over glue traps or poison, I favored the old-fashioned snap traps that worked as swiftly as the gallows. I&#8217;d caught such a succession of mice and variations of mice under the kitchen counter that I&#8217;d pasted a picture of Mickey Mouse inside one of the doors, circled and canceled through with black marker. I had been practicing with small things, it’s true, but I still wasn’t ready to kill a snake.</p>
<p>I eased open the door to my &#8220;The Cabinet of Doom&#8221; and peered inside, but I did not find the snake. The way the cabinet ran the length of the kitchen and the kitchen connected to the bathroom just beyond, the snake could have been anywhere. I know this must be hard to picture, but remodeling a granary into living space necessarily leaves some gaps of convenience, some loopholes through which civilization and the wild can still slip in an exchange of sorts, back and forth. I would have preferred a pest-free living space, but the granary had its share of charms. I moved in with a sense of adventure. My cat had the same idea and vanished through a hole behind the water heater on our first afternoon in the place. When I stopped panicking and calling everyone I knew, I saw her, the consummate tuxedoed house cat, strutting down the driveway from the big house. I promptly called my landlady, who plugged the hole. Life had been proceeding in this fashion ever since, presenting hole after hole to be patched. I&#8217;d even seen it snow right through the wall.</p>
<p>I remembered something my Indiana had said after he killed the Mother&#8217;s Day Special. &#8220;They follow the plumbing when they&#8217;re thirsty.” I did say it was a very hot July.</p>
<p>I gathered up my cat, remembering the &#8220;copperheads don&#8217;t climb&#8221; lore, and situated her with her litter box in the loft where I also planned to retreat. It was almost dusk, and I didn&#8217;t know what else to do. I waited, turning pages of a book. Just before ten, I heard a car crunching up the gravel drive and ran out to flag it down. It was the law student house sitter, heading up to the main house after downing a few at a local watering hole. I told him about the snake and didn&#8217;t stop chattering until he offered to come in and look around. Did I say he was reluctant?</p>
<p>&#8220;It could be anywhere by now,&#8221; the law student said hopefully. &#8220;Probably went back outside.&#8221; He suppressed a yawn.</p>
<p>But it hadn&#8217;t. We soon found it pressed up against the back door of the tub and laundry room. At first, I was in favor of just opening the door, but I remembered what Indiana had advised about the other one. This was probably its mate, but perhaps not. There was no way to be sure.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want to do?&#8221; the law student asked, backing away.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t blame him; my knees were water and my stomach felt like I&#8217;d just eaten a bushel of grass. &#8220;Death Valley Days&#8221; flashed through my mind, episodes that inevitably featured a bandanna tourniquet at some crucial point in the narrative, a knife slicing thigh or arm flesh and our hero sucking and spitting out rattlesnake venom to save a bad man&#8217;s life. Forget about anti-venom.</p>
<p>This was my home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kill it,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But how?&#8221; the law student asked, now with more interest in the project.</p>
<p>&#8220;With a hoe or something?&#8221; I hadn&#8217;t actually witnessed the other snake&#8217;s execution, so I was guessing here. Didn’t Farmer McGregor always swing a hoe after the rabbits?</p>
<p>“I’ve never killed anything before,” my reluctant hero said, and then qualified his statement. “Deliberately, I mean.”</p>
<p>“Me, neither,” I echoed. I guess I had already discounted the mice. I was the butcher of mice among women, yet I didn’t stop to count them. I was already gone, I suppose.</p>
<p>If it had been anything else, I would have stepped in at this point and volunteered, cheerfully relegating the law student to moral support. As a child I was read to incessantly from two books, <em>The Little Engine That Could</em> and <em>The Little Red Hen</em>. From these wise sources I’ve gleaned my personal philosophy of &#8220;I think I can do it myself.&#8221; And most of the time, it works well enough. I can use a wrench, a drill and two kinds of screw drivers, truss a turkey, make a decent cherry pie from scratch, replace the inner workings of a toilet, shop for a car without male support, and I once drove a stick shift on little notice as my high school date puked Boone’s Farm Burgundy out the window, but I was not doing this.</p>
<p>Where was my nature writer-Indiana Jones or the Hell’s Angel-turned-zoologist I later met, who had a dragon tattooed in his palm? The zoologist studied snake vocalizations by dissecting their throats. True. He was allergic to anti-venom and King Cobras were his research subjects, but I’m positive he’d have had no qualms about killing this snake. For that matter, where was my Lady of the Lands, who had so skillfully, if unmercifully, used a cool poker to clobber a rat that had refused to die in one of my attic traps?</p>
<p>Gentle reader, she was in France. I would have to make of this law student the one I required.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you can handle it,&#8221; I said, as if dropping a file onto his desk at 5 p.m., offering him a preview of corporate law practice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go get something,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t expect him to return. I doubt I would have. Someone had whispered to me earlier that summer that she thought the law student was gay, as though I cared. Now, I desperately wanted him to go against whatever remained of that tired typecasting. To his credit, he came back down to the granary toting a hoe, an ax and an orange snow shovel. They turned out to be good choices.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you’d better do it fast,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>He did it slowly, and the snake bunched up like a bulging biceps every time he tried to saw it with the dull ax blade. Eventually he managed to divide the copperhead into two stubborn halves while I held down its head with the hoe.</p>
<p>He carried it out the door in the shovel, one half after the other, apologizing for the iridescent mess of scales and pungent blood saturating the indoor-outdoor carpeting.</p>
<p>I just thanked him profusely, and after he&#8217;d gone, repeatedly scrubbed at the metallic blood. I swept up scores of glittering scales that adhered to my hands. It seemed I could not erase the stain with detergent and water, or even Boraxo powdered hand soap. Only time would wear the shimmer from my skin, and it never entirely left the blue carpet.</p>
<p>I KNOW MY snake story, like the World Serpent&#8217;s endless circling, has no end, that my encounters will continue until I receive the message, but what’s with these snakes? To live in harmony seems unlikely after so much blood and fear, avoidance and confrontation. If snakes are following me, I have to wonder why.</p>
<p>Today, I take a break from writing and walk outside to see how Ron’s doing with the rockwork on the pond below the waterfall. I want it all finished before the open house. Although he’s a large man, a professional greens-man for the movies and as practiced as a Druid with rock moving, I’m a little worried he’s handling too much alone. Virginia bluestone is much heavier than it looks; it’s very dense stone. I remember that each of the eighty Stonehenge bluestones weighs up to four tons and probably had to travel 240 miles from Preseli Hills in Wales. It’s enough to make you believe in aliens.</p>
<p>I’m trying to forget about snakes, about words and mysteries, when Ron says, “I’m sorry, but I killed a little snake in the pond. I didn’t mean to, but I flicked it when I saw it. Reflex.” Ron tells me it was a Queen Snake. Not poisonous at all. He pulls back a fold of rubber pond liner, and I see it, bright green and still writhing. Ron tucks back the liner. “I’ll get it later,” he says.</p>
<p>SNAKE MEDICINE IS potent, linking us back through every culture to the first shamans, snake charmers and holy women, alternately despised and worshipped. Perhaps I need to take a dream-time break and retreat, as the ancient Greeks did to their dream temples decorated with undulating snakes, guardians of sleep and healing. Maybe I need to consult an oracle.</p>
<p>My spoken language is tightly tied to the snake by my first encounter in the foyer of my childhood, when to speak its name through the shame of my imperfect speech meant the difference between complete and faulty communication, perhaps life and death. I didn’t yet trust that speaking the truth requires passion, not perfection. There are still a lot of things left to learn and certain mysteries to ponder: like why speaking the truth can so often lead to ridicule or silencing, even when the words are all pronounced correctly.</p>
<p>IN THE COUNTRY house I bought after living in the granary, I found another baby copperhead in my foyer late one spring. I almost stepped on it, and surprisingly, my ailing, elderly cat just avoided it, if she sensed or saw it at all. Even my dog let it alone, neither cat nor dog alerting me to the intruder. Again, it was a woodpile that attracted the invader: split logs stacked conveniently next to the door. Sometimes I learn things only after constant repetition. Would I ever, finally learn? I have let snakes go, aided in their deaths, and now I have killed them myself, but in every case they return, loop back, with another variation, another chance for me to gain some ground, some wisdom. Maybe this story has no resolution. I know it has no simple moral. Maybe my hair’s made of hissing snakes, and I’m the only one who can’t see it. Don’t look.</p>
<p>I swept that copperhead out the door, and gave it a good long toss off the shovel over the fence. This time, at least, I cast out the snake with a shovel, not my hand. Incremental progress, but progress nonetheless. The next few hours I spent in long sleeves, poking through the woodpile and gingerly removing each log until the steel frame cord holder was empty. I dragged the frame far from the house before restacking the logs. Then I ordered a new sliding door. There was a gap in the old one. I could have filled it with caulk, but I was into renovations in a big way back then, trying to achieve something that was all mine by rebuilding my little house one piece at a time. I had started with new hardwood floors before moving in and gone from there, replacing the faulty stove pipe that had a disintegrated liner, then the woodstove itself, graduating from a smoky appliance to one with a catalytic converter to save the environment. I replaced the kitchen appliances with ENERGY STAR brands, added a heat pump and a back-up furnace. Forty-year architectural shingles covered the roof, and the overhead light fixtures were all upgraded with ceiling fan kits. I added a carport and finally a screened porch, new stairs and decking, a waterfall and pond. Soon I would be gone.</p>
<p>The man who had installed the new sliding door told me that it was far superior to the old lopsided door that had never opened smoothly in the first place. “Botched installation,” he said, pointing out the rough and bent ridges of the original sliders. I had periodically re-greased them, but it never really helped.</p>
<p>The improved door was all metal, and too heavy and snug to be lifted off its track by burglars, he said. The way he said it kind of gave me the creeps. Something about my country house on fifty acres of trees always brought forth the approval of men, and their obvious envy made me nervous. Some of the men had wanted to move in with me after a few dates, and more than a few I’d hired to fix things over the last fourteen years had tried to sabotage something, maybe in hopes of returning.</p>
<p>&#8220;What about snakes?&#8221; I asked him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Snakes?&#8221; He reared up from the lock he was tamping and peered at me as if he’d seen Medusa.</p>
<p>His tense shoulders said it all, all that I imagined he thought about me: that if I was scared of snakes, maybe I and my copious bookcases belonged in a townhouse, not way out here in the sticks with wild turkeys and deer, owls, raccoons, three kinds of woodpeckers and the occasional fox, rare bobwhite and black bear. He didn’t know I’d seen a mountain lion perched on an outcrop like a watchful old spirit guide one bitter winter night. And in the rocks and woodpiles: snakes, an assortment of mostly invisible beauties. Timber rattlers; copperheads; the hog-nose rooting for toads; smooth black snakes keeping the perimeters clear; water moccasins down at the creek, swimming with their mouths unhinged, skimming the surface, each snake far more than a word to me. But how could this stranger know?</p>
<p>SOMETIMES ON SUMMER mornings mist wrapped my mountain, or, in winter, its rough, jagged shape caught the light stark against a cloudless sky. Spring trees dressed its angles with clumps of impossible green. Soon the color would molt again, transform, shedding red and orange down its slopes to tumble across the valley toward my porch and into my eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; I said to the door installer. &#8220;It was just a lame joke.”</p>
<p>&#8220;You had me going there with your snakes. I’d rather kill them than look at them, myself.&#8221;<br />
So, he was scared of snakes. That’s all. His face relaxed, and he bent back to his task, to test the new lock against the strike plate for the perfect fit.</p>
<p>It would be years before I was ready to sell that house, trade that solitude, that close range view of a mountainside and all of the creatures that came along with it. Neither of us knew what was coming next. The door was so heavy, he reassured me, that I wouldn’t need a sawed-off broomstick wedged in it for extra protection any more. No one could lift it off its sturdy new tracks, and nothing dangerous or beautiful could ripple through a gap.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Hawk and the Swallow</strong></p>
<p>Understand this: I had thought long and hard about birds. I had once, in fact, been a Fisheries and Wildlife major. I’d worked at a wildlife research center, fed waterfowl, cut up mice for raptors, taken blood from the veined wings of ducks, and, I’m sorry to say, “sacrificed” them for research purposes. The point is, I wasn’t a shrinking violet, and I’d paid a certain kind of attention, but I was a sucker for the Big and Dramatic &#8212; namely predatory birds like the osprey, the red-tailed hawk, the bald eagle. <em>Raptors Magnificus</em> floated my boat, especially in the Wide Open Spaces of the American West. My father, however, though he was a manly ex-fighter pilot and admirer of John Wayne, preferred a bird I frequently overlooked: the purple martin.</p>
<p>A nondescript swallow, I thought. A bird smaller than my hand, the male is the only swallow with a completely dark plumage, glossy blue-black above and below. The female has a similar back, but her chest and belly are a dingier gray-brown. In certain light, the bird’s glossy dark back looks purple &#8212; thus the name. In the air, they sometimes seemed to swarm, but each individual’s flight was difficult for me to follow. They were so small and fast that I couldn’t keep my binoculars trained on them for long. I much preferred the big hawks whose movements I could often make out with no field glasses at all.</p>
<p>Yet my father was fascinated by them.</p>
<p>He’d majored in zoology at the University of Kansas, finishing up what was left of his Navy-funded education around 1960, when I was a toddler. Later he’d taught me how to pay attention to the natural world. Sycamore trees had the big broad distinctive leaves and the peeley bark. Loblolly pines were the tall slim-trunked trees with the needles I had to rake constantly from the grass in our yard. The big tree I climbed in the side yard was a maple. He showed me how to use field guides and identify the songbirds that congregated at the feeders in our backyards. Bright red cardinals (my mother’s favorite) with their peaked caps were easy. Fussy jays often left behind bright blue feathers. Robins bobbed and hunted worms in the driveway after a rainstorm. Sparrows and towhees were common, but when the hawk-sized pileated woodpecker showed up, both my parents shouted for all to come and see. Perhaps because of this family value on nature, and the trailering we did as a family of five &#8212; once all the way across the country from California to Virginia &#8212; I’d developed a passion for the outdoors and spent hours in the Tidewater of Virginia daydreaming about how to get out West for a Rocky Mountain High. Indeed, John Denver’s album was among my first when I was coming of age in the 1970s. Birdneck Point, Bird Sanctuary, as our neighborhood announced itself, was lovely, but I wanted more drama in my life.</p>
<p>Thus, the road took me West, where I could sit on cliff edges and watch ravens soar and play on the wind. Red-tailed hawks flew low over the sagebrush, then arced upward into the sky, where they circled with their mates. Bald eagles and osprey hung out in the trees by the river or over the mountains along the Puget Sound. Osprey in particular built huge impressive stick nests on telephone poles in the open spaces near rivers and lakes. If I had to be reincarnated, I wanted to come back as an osprey. The joy, for me, was to be able to see over wide expanses of sky populated by one or two big soaring birds tracing the movement of the wind.</p>
<p>Who wanted to watch the nondescript swallows?</p>
<p>Yet, when I went back to Virginia, where my parents now lived on a 90-acre“gentleman’s farm” in the Shenandoah Valley, and allowed myself to enter “retirement time” with my parents &#8212; that less-hurried, less-harried lifestyle I both dreaded and desired &#8212; I was intrigued by the colony of purple martins living in the two apartment houses my father had erected for them.  Standing next to their houses, I craned my head back and watched them. Indeed, they were aerially acrobatic as they pursued a swarm of insects. Flying around each other expertly, they’d appear to be on collision course and then tilt their wings for a miss. They’d flap their wings and then sail, flap and sail, beautifully proportioned, streamlined, not unlike miniature planes with their outstretched triangular wings.</p>
<p>Arthur C. Bent’s 1942 monograph for the Smithsonian Institution offers Witmer Stone’s 1937 description of the martin’s flight:</p>
<p>Now one of them turns in his course and passes close to my head, swift as an arrow and uncanny in his blackness, which has no relieving spot of white, not even on the belly. . . . Again he will mount upward with rapid strokes of his narrow pointed wings only to return again to the lower level on a long sloping sail. Sometimes at the very summit of the ascent he will come about into the wind and remain stationary, on rapidly beating wings, before sliding away on the long downward sail. When flying high over the town, late in the summer, the Martins&#8217; mastery of the air is particularly noticeable.</p>
<p><em>Mastery of the air</em>. A marvelous phrase, descriptive not only of the martins but also of the males in my family. My father had flown one of the first jets &#8212; the F9F Panther jet &#8212; for the Navy during the Korean War, my brother flew the F-14 years later. Both of them landed and took off from carrier decks, making postage-stamp landings as the ship’s surface moved up and down on the heaving waves. I didn’t want to imagine it, much less execute it. For me, the only flights were flights on which I was a passenger, or &#8212; more frequently &#8212; flights of fancy.</p>
<p>In fact, my role in the family was determined early on: my father said I was the best dreamer.  As a girl, I do remember wishing I could fly. Someone told me if I ate a carton of Morton’s salt, I could do it. Not the big round carton, but a miniature size, as the vodka bottle on an airplane is to the larger version. I loved salt, so it wasn’t hard. After I downed the full container, I climbed a few feet up on a ladder and jumped. Gravity, of course, proved stronger than the flight of fancy.</p>
<p>My father, as a boy, made cardboard wings and ran down the alleyways in Altoona, Pennsylvania, trying to catch the wind. He built model planes from balsa wood and glue and found himself glued, also, to World War II movies. In fact, he volunteered to join the Navy toward the end of the war, at age seventeen, in Philadelphia, but it wasn’t until the Cold War, after a couple of years at the University of Pennsylvania, that he trained in earnest as a Navy pilot, going on to fly in combat in the Korean War.</p>
<p><strong>Luck</strong><br />
Beyond the blue rectangular pool surrounded by red brick, drinking our pre-dinner drinks, my parents and I could see the big barn painted a warm beige &#8212; my mother’s choice. The roof had flown off that barn once during a storm, nearly hitting my ex-fighter-pilot father inside his truck at the pasture gate. It surely would have killed him, but instead it plowed into a tractor shed &#8212; another moment of the sheer unadulterated luck that has followed him (so far) through life. The very day he was sworn into the Navy in 1945, he emerged from the building to find that World War II was over: it was VJ Day. Some years later, he was called from the cockpits of two different airplanes because, as a pilot with an instrument rating, he was needed to fly a different craft. After his replacement pilot took off, each original airplane had a mechanical failure, killing the unfortunate substitutes in separate crashes. The Navy, said my father, had orders to keep flying the aging planes, although they needed replacing. At that point, my father decided to quit flying and asked for reassignment to the Supply Corps.</p>
<p>He tells the story in summary &#8212; a rendering that, like the government documents he had to write and sign &#8212; leaves out the drama and horror of what he must have felt when he heard of his compatriots’ deaths. He knew what a dead pilot looked like. He’d been in charge of “clean up” after airplane crashes when he was stationed at Kingsville, Texas after the war. While at that post, he met my mother, a high school English teacher, in Corpus Christi.</p>
<p>All these years later, my mother listens to his story from her patio chair. Dressed in a red scoop-necked T-shirt and white capris, she holds onto her iced Manhattan, looking like a woman at a cocktail party with her shiny silver bangs and red lipstick. Her eyes still get wide when she says, “He had the keys to the King Ranch. No one had the keys to the King Ranch.” She gives her head a shake, her hair catching the evening light. The King Ranch in South Texas &#8212; an acreage the size of Rhode Island still home to some 60,000 cattle and 300 Quarter Horses &#8212; only offered its 150 years of history to the public during visiting hours. To be given the keys to such a place was impressive indeed.</p>
<p>My father shrugs. At 82, he’s thinner than ever, though he still does 50 crunches and push-ups a day, lifts weights, plays tennis and golf, gardens, repairs fences and tractors and keeps the place shipshape. He’s not a big man &#8212; maybe 5’10” and 150 pounds &#8212; but he’s always been determined, persistent, his blue eyes shining. Those blue eyes have always been ablaze with his various passions, whether they be the glory days of his flying, the richness of his garden, the excellence of my mother or the purple martins. “I <em>had</em> to have the keys to get in if there was a crash,&#8221; he recounts.</p>
<p>“I thought that was a terrible thing to do to an aviator,” says my mother.</p>
<p>“It didn’t bother me,” my father responds. “I loved flying.”</p>
<p>Watching the swallows swoop and skim to drink from the swimming pool before they chased insects in loops and wingovers, nearly colliding but never touching, as they joyfully found their suppers, I thought perhaps that was how my father dealt with sorrow &#8212; dip, taste if you must, then fly away. Don’t give yourself over to the depths of what touches you. Instead, take to the sky, to the joy of flight. It helps, of course, if you’re lucky.</p>
<p>IN FACT, SWALLOWS are said to bring luck. Their arrival portends springtime. They appear on flowering branches in Chinese paintings and are the harbinger of new love in Egyptian poetry. The Egyptian <em>Book of the Dead</em> instructs the deceased how to transform into a swallow, and the ancient Greeks and Romans believed the souls of dead children live on in the bodies of swallows. For pilgrims on their way to Mecca, the swallow is a symbol of fidelity: before people knew the birds migrated to Brazil, Muslims thought they went to Mecca.</p>
<p>Although some cultures warn that a swallow flying through the house portends bad luck, seamen welcome them on board as a sign of approaching land. Migrating between South and North America, of course, swallows range be far out to sea. Seamen who’ve sailed more than 5,000 miles wear a swallow tattoo; two swallow tattoos equal 10,000 miles, and a swallow with a knife through its heart is a memorial for a friend lost at sea. Thus, the largest swallow, the purple martin, is an appropriate favorite for my retired-Navy father.</p>
<p>FOR ME, ON the other hand, the tattooed swallow once signaled danger. As a teenager in Virginia Beach, sitting in my bikini on a towel, I frequently had to figure out how to ward off invasion by swallow-armed sailors who didn’t realize (or didn’t care) that I was underage.</p>
<p>I have other associations to overcome. Considering the martins from the farmhouse porch as they perched on an electrical wire against the evening sky, I saw something familiar in their heart-shaped silhouettes: weren’t they the cartoon birds that helped damsels in distress like Cinderella and Snow White? In my Golden Book circa 1965, Snow White rests her elbows on the windowsill to look out, and a songbird perches on her finger. This is the image of all that is good and pure from the <em>Good Housekeeping</em> era: the pale, raven-haired, wasp-waisted heroine keeping house and enjoying the quiet while her miniature men earn a living. In this Garden of Eden, pre-poisoned-apple moment, Snow White’s joyful submission to the drudgery of housework puts her in harmony with the swallows and songbirds, warbling their helpful melodies. She’s the happy bauble awaiting the return of her asexual men. It’s an image of entrapment that the feminist in me rejects. Unlike my father, I have never associated swallows with freedom.</p>
<p><strong>Housing</strong><br />
My father latched onto the swallows just as he was making his own transition from the air to the ground. He was going to college at University of Kansas in 1960-61 when a biology teacher offered purple martin houses to interested students and urged them to observe the inhabitants. My father, wishing to identify particular birds, loaded paintbrushes and mounted them above each apartment entrance to mark the birds’ feathers. He and my mother named the birds. When my Texan grandmother came to visit, she became so fascinated by the project that she got up at 4 a.m. to make notes about the birds’ behavior. Although I was just a toddler and have no memory of it, my parents’ stories of their time in Lawrence, Kansas is integrally connected in my mind with their passion for the purple martins, and I can’t help but associate the open skies and green hills of Kansas with my parents’ youthful enthusiasm for these swallows.</p>
<p>My father’s neighbors have erected purple martin houses to no avail on their woodsier lots, but the birds prefer my parents’ place, with its superior airspace. They like the electrical wires, which provide easy perches near their “apartments.” In fact, my father chose to install overhead rather than underground wires because he was thinking of the birds. The Big Sky, as my parents call it, is a feature they sought for my mother, too, when they bought their 90-acre gentleman’s farm and named it Riverbend. Though, as the daughter of an Air Force man and wife of a Navy pilot, my mother is a bit of a migrant herself, she grew up mostly in Arizona and Texas and feels most at home where she can see the horizon.</p>
<p>IN THE EASTERN U.S., purple martins used to nest in tree or cliffside cavities, but they quickly came to prefer artificial dwellings, and now they nest exclusively in human-made high-rise houses raised up on poles or wires. My father has two such structures mounted at 11 and 14 feet, each with about nine “apartments.” Martins in the Western U.S. are more traditional: they still use their ancestral dwellings, supplemented by hollowed gourds people provide.</p>
<p>Griggsville, Illinois, advertises the purple martin as “America’s Most Wanted Bird.” Its town center features a 70-foot, 562-apartment high-rise for purple martins and a martin house on nearly every street corner. Not surprisingly, its main industry is the manufacture of martin houses by a company called Nature House, Inc., started by nature lover and former antennae manufacturer J.L. Wade. During the pesticide worries of the 1960s, martins were thought to be good controllers of mosquitoes, but a study done by the Purple Martin Society concluded that, although martins consume a wide variety of flying insects &#8212; dragonflies, damselflies, flies, midges, grasshoppers, Japanese beetles &#8212; they don’t eat many mosquitoes.</p>
<p>An &#8220;Animal Planet&#8221; video clip shows an Ohio couple who remind me of my parents &#8212; attractive and apparently affluent, the gray-haired pair dressed in matching khaki shorts and tidy round-collared knit shirts (hers pink and his blue) and white tennis shoes. A knee-high dog with a long fluffy tail stands with them as they watch their purple martin houses with binoculars from their back porch.</p>
<p>The Ohio man grows gourds for the martins in his garden and hollows them out with tools in his shop. He strings a slew of gourds on wires between what appear to be telephone poles. With a pulley system, he can raise and lower the wires to check nests and clean out parasites. These are, apparently, condos with cleaning service, available only to the most upscale birds.</p>
<p>At the end of breeding season, all martins fly to Brazil for the winter. Condos in Ohio for the summer, Brazil for the winter. Monogamous pairing. Equal partnering in the nest-building, egg-warming and hatchling-feeding activities. Nice life.</p>
<p><strong>War</strong><br />
Sketches by a man with the unlikely name of Delmar Holdgrafer, cartoonist for the Purple Martin Society, suggest that landlords’ devotion to their tenants is a cultural phenomenon. One in particular reminds me of my ex-fighter pilot father. Peanuts’ Snoopy and a purple martin ride atop their respective houses manning machine guns. As they swoop toward an unsuspecting man whose hat has already been knocked off by a purple martin, Snoopy advises, “Get as close as you can before you climb up out of your dive.”</p>
<p>In the Korean War, my father was advised to hit “Targets of Opportunity”: bridges, trains, boats &#8212; anything that looked like it might carry people or objects related to the conquest of territory. “Anything that moved,” says my father. He remembers flying low over a fishing boat and seeing three men, afraid for their lives, jump overboard. “I could’ve killed those guys, but I didn’t,” he says. “They were just fishermen.”</p>
<p>A few years ago, I sat watching a video of pilots taking off from an aircraft carrier to go into combat in the Korean War. With me in his living room were my father and two of his friends who flew with him during the war. The men had, with their wives, driven their RVs to my parents’ farm, and the weekend had been full of laughter and good energy, but as the pilots on the video got into their cockpits &#8212; dressed in flight suits like the one my handsome young father wears in the black-and-white photograph next to his F9F Panther jet on the dresser in my bedroom &#8212; the room was filled with a heavy silence. It was as if these gray-haired men who now piloted RVs felt the same dread they had when they entered those planes on the deck of the <em>Bonne Home Richard</em> (the Bonny Dick, as it was called, tongue-in-cheek).</p>
<p>How many compatriots had they lost? What did they think as they looked at these men in the video, so like themselves, in their twenties, the crème de la crème in terms of coordination, intelligence and courage? Did they now also realize the extent of the destruction they had wrought, trying to stay alive, do their duty and serve their country by strafing airplanes piloted by “gooks,” who were, in truth, just excellent young men like themselves? Had any of them, unlike my father, flown low over boats full of innocent fishermen and blown them away? If so, had they been able to forgive themselves that great wrong done in the service of American idealism?</p>
<p>A LITERARY CRITIC compares the sound of Odysseus&#8217; twanging bow-string to a swallow’s call. Odysseus made his bow sing upon return from his 10-year wandering after the Trojan War and found his house full of suitors for his faithful wife, Penelope, a woman who put off the men who wanted to take Odysseus’ place by telling them she would not marry until she finished weaving her father-in-law’s shroud. She wove by day and took her weaving apart by night, still hoping for her husband to return. The poet makes an appropriate comparison between the swallow and Odysseus: both are returnees &#8212; like the swallows, Odysseus finally comes back at his nesting grounds, ready to take aim in order to reclaim his territory.</p>
<p>PURPLE MARTINS ARE defenders of territory, too. My mother gets a charge out of the female’s insistence that the other “girls” stay out of her nest. Her favorite thing about the birds is their chatter. “You know they’re talking to each other,” she says. “It’s all consuming.” She tries to imitate the twittering, making a vibrating sound with her tongue and lips. She admires their monogamy, also: she and my father are going on their 55th year of marriage.</p>
<p>Predators and competition, of course, provide unwelcome drama in the lives of the martins. My father hasn’t forgotten saving the martins from a blacksnake after my grandmother saw something odd hanging from their birdhouse pole.</p>
<p>“She said, ‘It looks like a sock or piece of rope,’” my father recalls. “But it was a snake. The martins were going crazy.” He lowered the birdhouse so he could remove the snake. “I tried to give it to your mother, but she didn’t want it, so I let it go down by the river.”</p>
<p>After that, he put up a copper wire parallel to the post in the ground and connected it to the 4,000-volt electric fence. “I saw the snake go up again, but he got down in a hurry.”</p>
<p>The &#8220;Animal Planet&#8221; Ohio man uses a sentry system to warn the martins about hawks. Tree swallows, who nest nearby in boxes he provides, issue a high-pitched warning call that tips off the purple martins when hawks are in the area. My father also keeps a loaded gun in his bedroom and regularly patrols the borders of his property. No one – man or beast or fowl &#8212; gets to fish or hunt on his land without his permission.</p>
<p><strong>Perennial Summer</strong><br />
Aristotle noted, &#8220;One swallow does not a summer make . . . ,” but summer is when swallows are most numerous, busily raising chicks in their apartment houses on my father’s Virginia farm. Males and females take turns caring for their young. They passionately defend their nests, fussing, with open beaks, in purple martin language and making expert aeronautical maneuvers overhead in their quest for insects.</p>
<p>Purple martins don’t show up much in central Washington state, where I live now. They like water, and the insects that gather near water, so they do appear west of the Cascades, where &#8212; unlike the eastern birds in their tenements &#8212; they prefer to nest singly in boxes over water. Yet, because of my parents’ passion, when I walk my dogs down Idaho Street toward the local irrigation canal, I notice the swarm of swallows &#8212; not purple martins but cliff swallows &#8212; described collectively as a “richness” of swallows.</p>
<p>Now, even when a hawk flies low over a distant cow pasture, drawing my attention to its swoop of feathers over high grass under a wide-open central Washington summer sky, I am more tuned in to the swallows than to this big predatory bird. A swallow flies right at me, a few feet overhead, tips its wings and makes a 90-degree turn, then flutters, turns, and goes the opposite direction. There’s another, and another, and several fly at once in a narrow airspace that must be full of bugs. They come at each other in what appears an impending collision, then tip their wings and miss by inches. Such a common bird. Tiny, dark, persistent in its pursuit of insects, flying in great “richnesses” from one continent to another. In this moment of communion with these birds, I am connected to their cousins, the purple martins, on my parents’ farm, and to my parents, especially my father the ex-fighter pilot, and seeing their flight I feel all the joys and sorrows of our trajectories.</p>
