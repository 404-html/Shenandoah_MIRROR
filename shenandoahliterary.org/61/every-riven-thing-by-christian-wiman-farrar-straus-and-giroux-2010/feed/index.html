					<description><![CDATA[This review gives me a gateway of sorts into this collection&#039;s poetry, and from the excerpts quoted, I can understand Mr. Belcher&#039;s reservations.  I&#039;d say this is the sort of review I want, the sort that offers a detailed, intelligent assessment.  There are so many books of poetry out there, and I appreciate a reviewer taking the time to delve into a book&#039;s strengths and shortcomings.  I need to see portions of poems to form my own judgements; this review gives them in just the right number.  Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this detailed and insightful analysis of the book, which voices some reservations about it which I haven&#039;t been able to put into words. It&#039;s a difficult book, grief-laden and unconsoling - God&#039;s absence is indeed everywhere felt. I really liked &quot;To grasp at minnows&quot; though - &quot;a mind resolve / star by slow star&quot; is lovely.]]></description>
