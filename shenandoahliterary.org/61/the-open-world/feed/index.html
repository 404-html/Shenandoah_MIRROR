					<description><![CDATA[From the first to the last, your story drew haunting images with words.  The precise and beautiful prose very much reflects my acquaintance with Japanese aesthetics and restraint, which I found flowing from the narrator-protagonist.  And suddenly, a whole life was conjured.  Really lovely writing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a fine essay, Ann. Your indigo canyons remain with me...and the walls we try and try to un-wall. I&#039;m happy to have heard from you, and I thank you for the link, and for your very kind words about my book. 

Paris must feel very distant to you, but if you have crossed many seas, the words carry you, yes? 
warmest regards to you, and all good to you for your future writing,
