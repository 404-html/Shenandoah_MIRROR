					<description><![CDATA[This story was thoughtful and complex. I especially enjoyed the segments traveling from different time periods, snapshots of Will&#039;s life and experiences as well as his joys and tribulations. Regina is described as almost so perfect it is frustrating, like she needs to just let it all go and take off on an impulse. The juxtaposition between her beliefs and desires and the tension holding Will back from pursuing his own hopes. The author has a clear and meaningful voice. I especially liked the metaphor in the opening of the story when Will is listening to the boys&#039; choir, how he felt as if he was being attacked. How could the harmonies of young voices make you feel attacked? Is it the guilt that these boys have been collected and improved, from their own complex and often painful histories. I appreciated that Will ultimately ended up following his intuition, buying a plane ticket for himself, despite the controversy he knew it would create with Regina. This story was well-written and impressively executed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A common trait that all of my favorite stories share is ambiguity. I like having something to chew on once I&#039;ve closed the book, or the tab. This is one of those stories. When I read his first incident, I tried to brush it off. I wanted to brush it off. &quot;Oh, it was just an episode of synesthesia.&quot; But it wasn&#039;t just anything. It was something else, and the more that became apparent to me, the deeper the story dragged me. I felt compelled toward it, just as Will is compelled toward Uganda. For me, it culminated with the startlingly clear image of  &quot;a sliding hue of dark blue, light blue, and grainy beige&quot; -- the ocean has its own ambiguity. This story will stay with me for a long time, I think.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A fascinating and delightfully ambiguous piece.  I appreciated that Fox set his story against the backdrop of American fundamentalism.  Though initially I wondered as to what this detail had to add to the overall narrative, I believe that Fox was making a comment about how right-wing fundamentalism, like the left-wing secularism that it often clashes with, tries to impose a pattern of rationality upon the world in spite of all the signs that the world is a fundamentally irrational place.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with Grace that it is the vivid descriptions and compelling details of Fox&#039;s story that draw the reader in first, and maintain this grasp voraciously until the end; a difficult feat to master. I grew up knowing some Christians who were home schooled and held similar views to the characters in the story. In my experience authors treatment of such outdated values are one-dimensional, so I appreciated the dynamic approach the author took with Regina, Will, and their families in this regard. Will believes a life of mundane certainty can bring him happiness,&quot;This, this. He wanted only this. With this he could be happy.&quot; But the possibility of this happiness does not solidify itself as a necessity. Are people searching for happiness alone, or is it a more complex condition of purpose and adventure that sustains satisfaction? Will chooses a dangerous, uncertain path rather than his simplistic vision of marital life with Regina. This choice is in keeping with what makes him a special character capable of defying the predictable: his ephemeral out of body experiences that draw him closer to the spiritual world. This makes Will unique, which is made clear by the authors description of the doctors who could not categorize his odd condition. Overall, the primary strength of this story is the way Fox travels through time, tying distant memories and recent occurrences together seamlessly. The woven collection of mismatched subject matter (refugee choirs, a home schooler’s dogma of strict chastity, young devoted love, a call to volunteer service abroad) are brought together harmoniously to make this piece really sing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The writer has a wonderful grasp of language, and he uses it to describe familiar details in unique and revelatory ways. I enjoyed how well the author conveys Will&#039;s branch of Christian culture in small details, not needing to go into lengthy exposition to convey a sense of the whole. I also value the sense of the author&#039;s invisibility. It feels like there&#039;s a direct connection between the reader and what Will thinks, what Will sees and experiences. In a similar way, the author never tells the reader what to think and how to feel; his writing creates impressions, but it&#039;s left for the reader to judge.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I truly enjoyed this story. Each paragraph was strategically used to used to add depth to the characters, furthering the plot tension. 
I loved how the story began, foreshadowing the ending, but allowing the reader to ignore the blatant hints in the meantime. Will looks to the Ugandan choir in an infallible, biblical sense and regards Regina as a seemingly shallow woman prioritizing social commitments above those in need. 
I love the description of the total body effect that the boys&#039; singing had on him and what little emotion he gave to his relationship with Regina. They seemed to reach both polarities of overwhelming emotion and none at all.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I loved the vivid descriptions and compelling details of this story. The author made me feel as if I was in Will&#039;s head and experiencing his internal dilemma firsthand. I enjoyed learning about Will&#039;s relationship with Regina through Will&#039;s portrayal of their experiences together and conversations between them. A lot was told about Regina through Will&#039;s flashbacks and internal musings. The clever. title immediately grasped my attention. It&#039;s a play on Will&#039;s dilemma to take a chance for the first time in his life, to leave behind the familiar and strong traditions of his community and to plunge into an exciting adventure.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like the division of character in this story. Will is two people: Regina&#039;s Will, who is reasonable, and pure, and whose simple desires are within reach any time he wants them; and the mystery Will, who appears without warnings, always alone, through these strange, unexplained, metaphysical moments. The story is on the surface about Will&#039;s decision to go to Uganda because he&#039;s a Christian and he wants to help people, but the layers below that are so much more complicated and unknowable. Will can&#039;t even articulate to himself why he wants to go. He knows it&#039;s not safe, and not good for his relationship with Regina, and any benefits the trip might offer are vague and never spelled out. But some otherworldly force makes his rationality meaningless. What exactly that force is, is the crux of the story. Less crucial to the deeper meaning of the story but absolutely necessary for the punch that it packs is the way the writer describes the sensory details of the experiences: he feels like he&#039;s been &quot;attacked,&quot; he feels &quot;pursued,&quot; it&#039;s the &quot;bubbling up of the vertigo, the uplift of a freefall.&quot; It terrifies him but it&#039;s a pleasurable terror.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As someone picking up pen and paper again after a long departure, it heartens me that the literary world still has a place for the sharp and cutting edges of ambiguity wrought in the realms where faith and physical-spiritual experience are drawn and upset by smiths (and Foxes, apparently) who understand in three dimensions, the price of the curves they forge. 

This is clearly not just a prize-winning story, but a tale that should be included in the literary lexicon of future generations. There&#039;s not one line that doesn&#039;t bear a Truth worth looking at, pondering over. [Cuss word implying writers&#039; Hades deleted.] You sure set the bar, high, don&#039;t you?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really appreciated the religious elements of this story, and I thought that the author did a wonderful job of tying all the religious points together at the end with the actual, audible &quot;calling&quot; that the main character experienced. The fact that it was just that, someone calling his name, and not the overdramatic display of bright lights and overt holiness, was what really struck me. It was by no means the burning of the biblical bush; yet it fit better into the story because it was something that could have happened in reality. After all, someone hearing their name being called is not supernatural. But in the context of this story, it carried great significance. 
One thing that I was slightly unclear about was the importance of chess in this story. Will points out that every move, at one point in the game, was accounted for and predictable. He knew how it would all play out, and so did his father (who the reader has come to dislike). And his father, realizing that he will lose, strikes the table in a fit of fury and injures Will, thus effectively ending the game. I thought that the significance would be that one side was religious, and one demonic, and that the father was always on the religious side. This could have been representative of God the father, who would always win. But the fact that the demonic side is about to win, and then the game just abruptly ends, threw me. Is there a metaphor hee that I&#039;m just not seeing?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Overall, I found this story interesting and enjoyable. One of the story&#039;s strongest aspects was the fact that it grabbed my interest at the beginning and only heightened that throughout. I think that starting in the middle of the story, rather then establishing a setting and characters and background information first, was the main reason for this.

Also, I was very interested in how the story would ultimately end. This was because I was invested in the main character, Will, very much. Not only did the author of this story make the main character come to life, but he did the same for every character in this story, and especially Regina. He wasn&#039;t judging any of his characters or telling readers what to think about them. The author simply presented the facts and allowed us to make opinions of our own. Because the characteristics displayed from Regina though, such as the long hair and home-schooling and great piety, usually come together to form a certain person, I was able to assume a bit more about her life, which I found really useful.

					<description><![CDATA[The author, John Matthew Fox, does a very impressive job of co-opting the language of people who grow up in home-schooled environments and thus develop a worldview that is off the track of the &#039;mainstream&#039; American experience. For instance, Fox captures the spirit of the home-schooled experience when he says things like &quot;He first met Regina at a brother-and-sister wing night at the bowling alley.&quot; I&#039;m friends with two people who were homeschooled at one point in their lives, and what I was struck by is that members of the home-schooling community don&#039;t refer to people they are friends with, but rather, families they are friends with. And the whole &#039;brother-and-sister wing night&#039; aspect captures this effectively. 

I like how Fox captures the inner conflict that plays in his thought process. The best stories are when two seemingly contrasting character qualities seem to combine to form a consistent character at-large, and I think that&#039;s happening here. A home-schooled student fits the profile of someone who would marry his high school sweetheart and never look back, and most home-schooled students are brought up in heavily religious environments. But what is another character trait of home-schooled students? Often, they have a tendency to participate in meaningful charity work beyond the &quot;dip our toe in the pool&quot; service popular with the country at large. So the fact that he would have an urge to go to Uganda to do service seems to be a consistent character trait that adds the layer of complexity necessary to drive the plot.

And, of course, the motives behind this desire to go to Uganda cut right to the big picture of what is going on. Does he want to Uganda purely out of a selfless desire to help the less fortunate? Probably not. So why would he want to do it then? For himself. This isn&#039;t to cast a harsh moral judgment, but rather, to examine the driving psychology of the protagonist. Why exactly does he want to go to Uganda? Without explicitly saying so, it seems that Will is dissatisfied with the predictability of and the steadiness of his life at home with his girlfriend. In some regards, Will is a weak character--most men probably wouldn&#039;t admit that their girlfriend makes the advances and drives the relationship, yet Regina is wearing the proverbial pants in the relationship, and Will&#039;s escapism to Uganda is an attempt to get away from that undesirable power dynamic. We see how this shifts the power a little bit--Regina acquiesces and kisses him, because Will has finally gone on the offensive for what is most likely the first time in their relationship. 

Looking at what Professor Smith said, I agree that the interplay between psychological strangeness and religious intervention form an underlying strength of the novel--I like wondering, is this really happening or is there a psychological deficiency taking place? The two are blended together in a way that &#039;makes the story work&#039;---if it was explicitly religious, then there is less suspense and the reader has to suspend disbelief. If we know he is having psychological problems explicitly, then the question arises whether the author is overstepping his bounds in creating a character that might be too wily unbelievable to be fully appreciated. But when the two come together, the reader thinks &#039;Huh. Tell me more about this guy&#039; and that serves as the hook that catches and then keeps the readers&#039; emotional investment in Will&#039;s future that give this story its consequential aspects.

I like the mismatch between Regina and Will on expectations that Fox introduces to the reader early when he mentions that Regina is attending a baby shower of a friend who is already having a third child. Regina is looking to this woman with envy, and suggests that she is disappointed she is not at that stage of life herself. Will, meanwhile, is disappointed over that very possibility--he has a &#039;there must be more to life than this&#039; attitude towards the stable marriage route. This is a clever play on disappointment that reveals a sharp divergency--Regina is disappointed she&#039;s not married with kids, Will is disappointed his life is pointing in that direction. 

I liked the consequences of Regina&#039;s decision to kiss Will. Fox gives it a seriousness and gravity that is difficult to capture in a mere kissing scene without coming across as over-the-top. She makes a last-ditch attempt to maintain control of her relationship by abandoning one of the most manifest examples of her control--the desire not to kiss--in an attempt to keep Will that falls short. The mechanical, forced nature of the kiss that backfires is an original storyline--where else does a first kiss induce this type of failure? It&#039;s a very creative concept, and I like Fox&#039;s artistry in demonstrating how Regina&#039;s attempts to keep Will inadvertently reinforce Will&#039;s desire to leave--this law of unintended consequences is something we can all relate to and extrapolate meaning from. In Middlemarch, I read how Causabon&#039;s desire to mention in the will that Dorothea can do anything but marry Will Ladislaw and she can receive the full inheritance--this is Causabon&#039;s dying wish, and puts into Dorothea&#039;s mind the potential to see Will Ladislaw as a romantic partner, and ushers her on that inevitable path to marrying him. A similar thing happens here--Will was probably going to go to Uganda anyway, but Regina&#039;s failed kissing scene has an impetus affect that further strengthens Will&#039;s resolve to leave. 

This may seem odd, but my favorite scene came when Will visited the bookstore and saw three books on Uganda, bought a guidebook, and then didn&#039;t tell Regina about it. This scene gentle packs a lot of information for the reader to decipher. We learn about the consistent religious orientation of Will&#039;s mind--he sees three books, and sees the coincidence as proof of divine Trinity forces at play. That reveals his mindset. We see him buy a book--vote with his dollars and make a cold-hard purchase--which reveals that he is taking the next step on his path to going to Uganda. There is something concrete about buying that guidebook--it transforms from a nebulous idea to a legitimate potential plan of purpose. And most importantly, the fact that he does not tell Regina about this--in fact, he lies to her and says he was &#039;just browsing&#039;--tells us a lot about Regina and Will&#039;s relationship and how Will wants to avoid causing Regina pain is about to commit to an action that will permanently call into question their relationship. Potent stuff from visiting a bookstore and buying a book!]]></description>

What I most like about the story is probably the fact that I can take Will&#039;s spells as either religious experience or psychological strangeness, or I can say &quot;both,&quot; all without decentering the story, which doesn&#039;t depend upon our understannding that part of Will&#039;s consciousness to empathize with the more sublunary aspects of his dilemma.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In one of the latest creative writing classes, we discussed the implementation of the adage, “carpe diem,” into one of the stories being work shopped. In “To Will One Thing,” (featured in the current issue of Shenandoah) author John Matthew Fox draws on the cliché of “seize the day” through a skillful blend of descriptive imagery and well developed themes, but the story is refreshing and far from contrived. Like its main character Will, the story transcend the theme and endorses Pascal’s infamous saying: “The hear has reasons that reason can not know.”  Although the story is not a prototypical Shenandoah story with religious extremes and out of body experience, the quality of writing and the overall narrative is worthy of the magazine. Fox illuminates a character more complicated than original perceived: “Instead of his normal instinct to pin down feelings with philosophical thoughts, he wanted to run through fields and not grow weary. He wanted to swim and not grow tired. He wanted this soundtrack to animate his life.”  Will’s response to the Ugandan boy choir and desire for growth embodies the story’s central question. The ever evolving struggle between safety and individual desires. Fox fluidly combines descriptive language with seamless internal monologues in this portrayal. 
	Although the story has numerous strengths, I believe its best quality is the effective voice of the narrator, who serves as the impartial, but eloquent intermediary in Will’s plight. The story focuses on Will’s revelation as he debates whether to leave his “pure” queen Regina and face the challenges in another world. Fox portrays this epiphany through floating imagery and the clear narrator voice. The ending scene shows this sort of out of body experience: “ Then he sensed, behind eyelids, the entire room swell, objects blooming so close that he felt shrunk by their magnitude, and the shifting sizes disoriented him. His ears hurt; his equilibrium swam. It tilted him, made him drift. This time, he didn’t fight it. He let the objects press against him, overwhelm him. He sensed his own body enlarging to match their dilated size and was not afraid.”  In describing a fairly unordinary transcending experience, the narrator is concise, but his language is powerful. The chosen diction “objects blooming” and “shrunk by their magnitude” eloquently conjures the scene from Will’s perspective in a simple, but potent manner. Throughout the story, Fox walks the tight rope of religious extremism in which the story is set and never waves. In his alteration of syntax and sentence structure, the author creates a lively and powerful scene. “This time, he didn’t fight.” Again, Fox presents another precise sentence with great meaning. In my own creative writing, I need to take a page (unfortunately not literally) from the author and chose my words with the utmost care. Sometimes more is less, and Fox avoids the overly grandiose, which I am victim to. From many stories in Shenandoah, I realize that constant tinkering and deduction is needed for quality prose.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This story is interesting in that the author is able to present two choices. One is certain- Will knows exactly what his life will be like if he indeed marries Regina. The other is not so certain. He has no idea what he is throwing himself into when he volunteers to go to Uganda which indeed he suggests is a &quot;volatile&quot; territory. He could even be putting himself in  great danger. What makes his choice believable, however, is from the very beginning of the story, the author shows Will as not quite ready to fully commit himself to Regina- he has not yet bought the ring. Regina resents this, but there is no mention that Will resents it as well. Perhaps this great choice was the thing that he needed to propel him out of the relationship in which he was not quite sure of himself. His relationship is a certainty and he desires the opposite. When he finally makes the decision he enjoys the instability that it makes  him feel, &quot;The bubbling up of vertigo, the uplift of a freefall armed with only timing and hope. It was a feeling he’d missed.&quot; Perhaps it was really never a choice for Will at all, but rather a natural progression of things. He says that he could be happy with her, but that would be in a world in which he had no other options. That world does not exist. 
Personally, throughout the story I was hoping that Will would make the decision that he ultimately made. Regina seemed to me almost overwhelmingly chaste and I wanted Will to be able to experience everything that he wanted to. However, I liked how the ending was not an overly joyful one. In order to go to Uganda, Will is giving up someone he loves and he is aware of that. He is happy about his decision but at the same time it saddens him. We can see that he truly did love Regina and this makes him a more sympathetic character.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What I enjoyed most about this story was the exactness of language and creativity of description. For example, &quot;Terraced upon metallic risers, they elongated their jaws,&quot; is a sentense that is unusually crafted but perfectly accurate to the action being described. The endurance of such descriptions provides for an interesting variety in the narrative. Because the reader is so intimately cued into Will&#039;s thoughts, there is an automatic sympathy and understanding of his actions. Although Regina is not a villain by any means, her coldness towards his wanting to go to Uganda renders her an apathetic and unlikable character. (Despite the fact that Will does seem to care about her). Also effective were the sentences that were short and nondescript, as they contrast the rest of the narrative. This juxtaposition is seen in the sequence of sentences, &quot;Then he realized. Those were not bags. Those were not bags.&quot; The repetition adds to the dramaticism of Will&#039;s realization that his calling will involve a world so different than his life of muted emotions and chess figures.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My favorite part about this story was that it was told in snapshots through Will&#039;s point of view.  I felt like that really helped me see that he was just going through the motions in his life, taking in a lot, but trying to decide what everything means to him and how he feels about everything that is going on.  

I felt a lot of sympathy and emotion for Will because of the internal conflict that is presented throughout the story.  He is constantly saying that he loves Regina and thinks he could be happy with her; however, he just seems like he&#039;s going through his life and setting, wanting more, and knowing that he can make more of his life whenever he wants.  

I saw the change in him that we&#039;ve been talking about all year.  I saw him turn into a more independent and confident person who, although he remains kind and doesn&#039;t want to hurt Regina, decides to live his own life and make himself a priority.  I respected him greatly for that.  This was a very entertaining story.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Will, she just wasn&#039;t the girl for you.

What do people make of these &quot;moments&quot; Will has? Several times he describes these out of body experiences, and I found myself wondering why the author put them in the story. Could it be that by showing some sort of reoccuring health problem, Will realizes his time on this earth could end? Could the motivation for going to Uganda be the result of a declining physical health?

Also, I found myself doing a double-take of this line: &quot;Then he jammed the list in the trash beneath the chicken carcass.&quot; Is the image of the chicken intentional?

Lastly, just a quick note: while it can affect men, hirusitism is the excessive hairiness on women. Either way, a very interesting way to describe a potential father-in-law (she really wasn&#039;t the one for you, Will).]]></description>
