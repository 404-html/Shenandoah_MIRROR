					<description><![CDATA[Re: Alarie&#039;s comment
Never thrilled with technology.
Nothing like a book in the hand to hold and smell,
taste... like a lover near, no photograph or holograph.
Imagine the kiss of air, and all the thought
that disappears... we are, of course, temporary -- 
and even quicker than before: because of today.

Re: Rosemary
I wish there were a law that music (and it is unwelcome noise) were banned from ALL public places and instances, where you did not go there to specifically hear it being played/performed.  Being as irritable as cigar smoke and cess pools, if you don&#039;t want to smell  them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m delighted that Shenandoah has gone on line.   So far I&#039;ve only read Linda Pastan&#039;s poem of the week and this one, and I&#039;ve loved both enough to pass them on.   Reading your journal could take quite a while at this rate.   Both these poems make me sit and ponder a moment after my first thought, &quot;Wish I&#039;d said that.&quot;]]></description>
