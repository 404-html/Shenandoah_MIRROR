					<description><![CDATA[I may not sleep for weeks again after reading this!  I am so frightened of snakes I once had to be physically carried out of a field at Bread Loaf after stepping on some harmless reptile!  But Sewanee is on a &quot;copperhead trail&quot; and the place swarms with them.  People refer to outbreaks of children getting &quot;stung&quot; by the vipers because the antivenin is so much more dangerous than the poison itself.

That being said, what a beautifully written, lyrical, and ... provocative (?) essay!]]></description>
