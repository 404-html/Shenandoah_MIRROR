								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Señor Don Armando’s throat was slit in his sleep under a full moon, the same fate that befell his other men. As daylight broke, his decapitated head speared on a stake greeted the dawn, a pointed warning to other outsiders. King Juan Carlos, having not heard from his envoy, dispatched another crew of brigands, misfits, criminals, psychopaths, rapists, child molesters, murderers and other psychotics to find Armando’s men. I need not tell you what happened to these miscreants, suffice it to say that their bones were picked clean and that they complimented the stew of roots, cassava and turtle meat nicely. More powerful that their guns, swords and spears, however, were their germs, which crossed an entire ocean, incubated for months aboard a filthy ship, a virtual floating cesspool. By the time they made land, most of the men—those who had survived the sojourn—were sick. Within weeks, the natives developed boils, sores and itchy rashes never before seen, none of which could be cured by their brews, spells and potions. Convinced they were being punished by the gods, they accepted the newcomers as their rulers and, within decades, the natives were indistinguishable from the European conquerors, so much had their genes intermingled.</p>
<p>The first Spanish ruler of Corõzco, Carlos Izquiera, died of malaria within two weeks of arrival. Izquiera, who expected to land upon a tropical paradise, was quickly disabused by the larvae infested waters, the stifling heat and humidity, the impenetrable jungle, and the vapid, starch heavy indigenous food. By the end of the second day he was sick of cassava, plantains, taro root and manioc. In his final moments, delirious from the mosquito borne disease, too weak to reach for a glass of water at his bedside, he called out for his mother and asked for water.</p>
<p>Miguel Santiago, the first indigenous person to hold office, was overthrown in a coup d’état orchestrated by the CIA over concerns about his coziness with the Soviets. One dawn the army raided his house and, finding him not in bed but sleeping on the floor because he was used to sleeping on it as a child, the army shot him dead. That very same night the head of the army General Jorge Huerta was sleeping in the former president’s bed.</p>
<p>Not long after, following a series of kidnappings, police beatings and harassment of the press, General Huerta died from eating a bowl of tripe stew. The cook was apprehended and executed on the spot. Said a guard, “I never liked his cooking anyway.” Some said the tripe was poisoned, others that the cook had purposefully not cleaned out the intestines. Either way, the dish, which was already popular among the poor who had been eating it for centuries, became sought after among thrill seekers and gastronomic daredevils.</p>
<p>The first democratically elected president of Corõzco, Pablo Morales &#8212; nicknamed El Niño not for the much maligned weather phenomenon (of course, a bad weather pattern had to be foreign) but for his babyish features &#8212; died when the stage he was speaking from collapsed, killing him and dozens of his supporters who were celebrating his victory. El Niño was given a state funeral with full military honors (although he clashed with the latter on several issues). Both those who watched the funeral on television and those who saw it in person agreed that the former president in his open casket looked every bit as youthful as he had in life.</p>
<p>Fidel Conteras’s short-lived presidency ended when his private plane crashed over the vast uninhabited interior. It took days of arduous trekking and machete hacking through the jungle to reach the crash site, during which time one of the rescuers died of dengue fever. No black box was ever recovered from the wreckage, the cause of which was chalked up to mechanical failure. However, it was rumored that a member of the opposition was servicing the cabin that day and, having made his way into the cockpit, wrested the controls from the pilot and made the plane nosedive into the jungle. It was also said that the man crossed himself and kissed a locket of the Virgin Mary he kept around his neck before impact. In his native village, his family erected an altar in his image with a small toy airplane. What was recovered from the crash were a case of the president’s favorite cigars, five kilos of cocaine, and a pallet of thousands of singed dollar bills. News of the crash was withheld from the public until a suitable successor could be found thereby preventing the opposition from filling the power vacuum. The choice was clear. General Sanchez was not only the head of the army but the president’s right hand man. In fact, he was scheduled to travel with the president that very day but—conveniently or not, depending on your political affiliation—he happened to oversleep the morning of the flight.</p>
<p>General Gustavo Sanchez, convicted of genocide, bribery and corruption, was executed in a fusillade by his own men in the Plaza Domingo after which his body was spat and trodden on by the locals. Rather than have one bullet and several blanks distributed among the firing squad, each soldier had a bullet in the chamber of his rifle so that each one could say with pride that his bullet had been the one that killed the General.</p>
<p>Luiz Gusman died in the Terre Haute federal penitentiary in southern Indiana from type II diabetes. During his rule, Corõzco became the biggest narco trafficking state in the southern hemisphere. Blatantly disregarding international condemnation of his regime, which provided protection and support to the drug cartels, he was abducted by Navy Seals in a Black Ops raid and extradited to the U.S. on drug charges. It took two full days for his security detail to realize he was missing, so notorious were his marathon drug benders which could last days without anyone from his staff ever seeing him leave his room.</p>
<p>Efrain Nocera was executed at The Hague following a successful conviction for crimes against humanity, the first sentence of its kind. The court, not equipped to carry out such a sentence, built an execution chamber which, over years of disuse, was ultimately converted into auxiliary office space, the occupants of which reported strange happenings, from a malfunctioning copier that would print blots of red ink to an overboiling coffee pot that would whistle and hiss. Needless to say, the office was vacated, boarded up and used as storage thereafter.</p>
<p>Fernando Gomez, a Harvard educated technocrat and reformist—who vowed to bring Corõzco into the twenty-first century by funding education, linking every village to the Internet, and acknowledging the crimes of the past through a truth and reconciliation tribunal did not die. Seen as an outsider with his PhD and expensive suits, he never connected with voters. He lost handily whereupon, discouraged and dispirited, he returned to Harvard to take a post-doctoral fellowship, wrote many papers about the economic dysfunction of Corõzco and became a professor of economics. In his fifties he was tapped as Corõzco’s next economic minister, a post he politely declined by citing his family and health. In truth, he’d aced his last physical, his wife and he were estranged, and his children grown.</p>
<p>Enrique Sandoval, a popular and handsome telenova actor who won in a landslide, died of an overdose shortly after taking office. Much beloved, news of his passing devastated the public, especially its women who sobbed day and night for a week. Reruns of his telenovela ran nonstop on state television. During his funeral procession, mourners carried large placards with his picture. Husbands and boyfriends, however, breathed a sigh of relief as they would no longer have to compete with Sandoval, whom every woman in the country was secretly in love with. So many bouquets and cards were deposited on his gravesite that local boys would take the freshest bouquets and resell them.</p>
<p>Uriel García, by the far the longest tenured head of state at two months, three days, eleven hours and fifty-three minutes, was found dead in his favorite whorehouse. He passed so quietly that Isabella did not notice anything wrong except that his staying power seemed vastly improved. Her screams brought his security detail into the room. His death confirmed—a bad heart; women and spicy food were his downfall—his security detail wrapped him in a sheet, put him in the trunk of the presidential Mercedes and drove him back to the presidential compound, where he was placed in bed, a doctor summoned, and the official time and cause of death recorded. A great man mourned throughout the country for his commitment to indigenous rights, no one at the funeral cried harder than Isabella whom the secret service out of indulgence permitted to attend.</p>
<p>At Fernando Ruiz’s state funeral there was no open casket. There was no official medical report stating the cause of death. Some of the pallbearers were rumored to have said that the casket was surprisingly light. No sooner than he stepped into office that he fell prey to accusations of embezzlement. One newspaper report claimed that as much as five million dollars were missing from the state coffers. By one account, he is living in exile in Miami where he spends his days at the beach, smoking cigars, enjoying the view, and watching women in bikinis stroll by.</p>
<p>Jóaquin Jimenez, strangely, did not die in office. Well aware of the inauspicious end that befell his predecessors, he nonetheless took the oath of office. He may have been the only president who out of precaution cooked all his own meals. His handpicked security detail, each member of which he personally vetted, always varied their route. He never took a plane, helicopter, boat or any other conveyance that posed a risk, even though he was an expert sailor. At all times under his suit he wore a bulletproof vest. Anyone who came within ten feet of him, even his staff, was frisked. He rarely travelled and, if he did, he travelled by car in a convoy of multiple armored vehicles. Each speech he gave, each meal he ate, each hand he shook he expected to be his last. His heart raced whenever he was in public. He governed judiciously and diplomatically, avoiding conflict and making few enemies. In fact, his tenure was so unremarkable and unmemorable that much to his relief he lost reelection. So it goes without saying that people took news of his death barely a day out of office as a shock. It appears the ex-president, so happy to have survived his tenure in office, celebrated his newfound freedom by taking his catamaran out to sea. It was a clear beautiful day, perfect for sailing. No one could have predicted the gathering clouds on the horizon that seemed, without explanation, to converge on the tiny vessel.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chase works the edge of the pool with the shovel, sweat plinking from the tips of his hair, chittering out the perpetual monologue of the eight-year-old boy. Mallory, elfin-eared, eleven, sits squinching her brown toes in the delicious warmth of the bottom sand. This is the musical simplicity that appeals to her: the chunch of her brother&#8217;s spade, the whisper of the ocean shallows, the sizzle and lash of the shorepound.</p>
<p>She scans the wind-rippled sea for her mother&#8230; afloat somewhere on the breathing hills, out past white ropes, a blonde speck on a sky-blue board. Mallory&#8217;s eyes––Cherokee eyes, lambent as black tea––strain to the belt of darkest water, to the place where dream monsters glide white-eyed in the abyss.</p>
<p>A storm brews in the Sargasso: witch cauldron, twists of Saharan sand, hooded troops launched shoreward. The swell&#8217;s fury is still a few hours from this coast, but the little girl can sense it with an animal prescience, like the seagull that bends suddenly landward but cannot divine why.</p>
<p>Chase––tanned, towheaded, awkwardly muscled, jointed in the way of a young macaque––stuffs his shovel into the sand. &#8220;Is that good enough?&#8221; he says. &#8220;Mallory, wake up!&#8221;</p>
<p>She is watching her mother levitating over water. &#8220;I just remembered my dream,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I was flying over the Montessori playground.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Flying? I never fly in my dreams.&#8221; Chase plunges his fists into silt and bubbles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you ever try?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought if I jumped out a window, maybe. It didn&#8217;t work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to start on the ground,&#8221; she says. &#8220;A sidewalk, or a field. You get running with the wind, like you&#8217;re paddling for a wave. When your feet feel really light, you test the air in little hopping jumps, and then, when you&#8217;re ready&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Chase&#8217;s head snaps to attention. The father is thumping down the beach––bald, shoulders tufted, monkish, three surfboards balanced on his head. He lays them by the pool: gleaming crafstman&#8217;s pieces, hand-shaped tints of coke-bottle blue, malachite green, ripe persimmon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it too big out there?&#8221; Mallory says.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s four foot glass,&#8221; says the father. &#8220;Swell&#8217;s not going to hit until the afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chase is already kneeling at his board, scraping wax over his deck with rapid strokes. Thrumming sound, like wings.</p>
<p>They wade out through warm lace, toss their boards down, swim into bands of white, lattices of rainbow.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that face?&#8221; the mother says when the little girl ejects over the top of a wave. The mother turns round to look, but sees only lilac clouds glued on the low sky, the water like hammered gold.</p>
<p>Fresh from her bath, ponytail darkening the back of her shirt, Mallory arranges the plumeria in the bowl with zen precision, plipping them in stem-first so the pink and yellow petals overlap spiralwise. She has the same heart-shaped face, same Cherokee cheekbones as her mother. Listen: the stormswell attacks the beach: thunder made operatic by distance. Her father is away, surfing some coquina reef, her mother on a quest for groceries.</p>
<p>Cabbage palms flail east. A yellow butterfly dances in the front yard, tracing in backward hops and loops its doomed crusade against the wind. But what is missing from this sonata? Some whoosh, some clatter. A familiar percussion instrument. Mallory glides over polished oak floors, calling her brother&#8217;s name. His bedroom is empty. The playroom, too. The bathroom. She peeks her wet head into the steam and dust of the garage. &#8220;Chase?&#8221; His sandals are gone. And his surfboard.</p>
<p>She sprints across the road on fawn legs, barefoot, threading a gap in the traffic, throttle of waves like china cymbals––whiting out the hum of the northbound cars. She can see them already, a hundred feet before the crossover: monstrous salt geysers, erupting over the sea grapes, over the wooden rails. She takes the stairs by twos, wind spitting tendrils of hair into her eyes, into the corners of her mouth. The ocean rears up like a mountainscape, creased, blue, majestic.</p>
<p>Where is her brother? There: a lone black buoy, rising up a pleated hill, swept down again into a valley. The sea pulsates, shrugs. Folds in slow motion. Chase appears high on a glittering cliff, vanishes behind a seaglass ridge. Again he mounts a ledge, this one too steep&#8230; Mallory watches as his board flutters out from under him like a leaf, like a weightless thing.</p>
<p>The wind pulses. The sea oats––plumaged priests of the dunes––all bow east. Both boy and board are crushed by the white pillars.</p>
<p>Mallory&#8217;s heart is a mess. No surfers in the water, no fisherman, no one walking the sands. Only the slow, unfeeling waves. Building, collapsing.</p>
<p>Chase&#8217;s board comes up first, breaches like a tarpon, flips and flips, feathers toward shore, moving too fast, weightless. Unmoored.</p>
<p>Only after the set has cleared does she sight her brother again, windmilling on the milky ruins. A rip current drawing him out like driftwood.</p>
<p>She tests the wind in dashes and leaps. The sand scalds her soles like a skillet. So not a dream. She runs under the wrack line, hops from foot to foot on cool packed sand. Chase&#8217;s board skips along the inside reform, tumbles like a blade of grass on the rapids, fires over the shorebreak toward her, leash twitching like a cut snake. She snatches it at the water&#8217;s edge.</p>
<p>Chase, like a water insect, flitting in the impact zone. A cresting wave holds him up like a moth in a glass box. His arms airfoil––fragile wings––before the smack of the white paw takes him down.</p>
<p>Whitewater forces Mallory up into the seaweed. Board tucked under her arm, she awaits the set&#8217;s discharge. The long period swell: a chaos followed by a simmering lethargy, like a father who, after a rage, sinks into his chair to gather his breath.</p>
<p>Chase reappears now, smaller than before, still reeling out. Mallory feels herself pulled eastward, tugged toward him as if by a fishing line. Taste of metal in her mouth, she sprints into the water. Everything drained of sound. Blood attracting blood. Even her footsplashes are silent. She falls onto Chase&#8217;s board, slices out like a scull, shivering in terror. Clouting slick leather.</p>
<p>Zephyrus, wind from the west, flings the girl over the green shoals. She rises to her knees, driving, lets loose a wild bark as the horizon curtains up in the east. Here is Chase, panting, treading water.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get on!&#8221;</p>
<p>The board lurches with the boy&#8217;s added weight. Mallory shoves him to his stomach, wedges herself between his legs. A foundering vessel. Chase retching, spagging seawater. His arms like clay over the rails. The thundercloud nearly on them. Mallory throws her shoulders into her strokes. They cut a slow line toward the dark frothing hem of the world. The only safety in the deep water now. The wave climbs beneath them&#8230; she can feel herself going slick, slipping down the backside of the board.</p>
<p>Swan-winged Zephyrus, lover of youth, lightest of all things, shrills another gust, skims the children up and over the blunted hill. Chase&#8217;s hands, revived now, track like horse hooves on the seaskin. A second wave, bigger than the first, advances on them, teeth sparkling. Mallory digs in. Her father&#8217;s lessons: <em>Xanthus and Balius, the storm-foot twain.</em></p>
<p>A monsoon––the spray blown off the back of first wave––swallows them whole. Blind, deafening ephemera. They pace through the torrent. Again Mallory has the wild sense of sliding off the surfboard. They are vertical. Chase is perched on the nose. She grabs hold of his legs, the board tilts, and they soar together down the backside of the wave.</p>
<p>Thrash of forehooves. They fight up and over the humped blue back of the third wave. Push. The fourth wave slips under them. The fifth. On the outside, the children sit up and face each other: sick at the bumping of their hearts, at the sight of the faraway tiny playhouses on the beach. Too much sky over them.</p>
<p>Chase&#8217;s jaw seems more square, whittled to bone, like the hard little boys up the street. His eyes smaller and blacker in his face. &#8220;It&#8217;s five waves,&#8221; he says, trying to sound tough, his voice thin as tissue paper. &#8220;Every time, five.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What were you thinking?&#8221; Mallory says. &#8220;You paddled out by yourself? You didn&#8217;t tell me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was fine. I caught a couple good ones. Just, my leash&#8230;&#8221; He lets loose a wet, gurgling hack. Gushes foam from his lips.</p>
<p>The surfboard is an eight-foot egg, sturdy enough for a boy of 48 pounds, but dubious under the weight of both brother and sister. The children kick in constant circles to maintain balance in the rollwaters. The houses are shrinking. The coastline is bent, fish-eyed, so that the Eighth-street steeple seems too close to the Cape, and the Cape too close to the water tower.</p>
<p>&#8220;How are we going to get in?&#8221; Mallory says.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to try to catch the fifth wave,&#8221; Chase says.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if we wipe out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if we do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We swim in on the lull,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like you were doing before?&#8221;</p>
<p>The children tense in unison; another wave shoulders up in the east. They grapple into darker water. The sea builds under them, hoists them into the gale, then plunges on, dropping them in the shade of a quiet cove. The water thickens about them, and they are thrust once again into the smack of the heights. Five times they take the ride, five times are held up for inspection and let down. When the set is done, they squint through the spindrift at the sun-glossed clouds&#8230; flaming spines, tangerine feathers, golden fishbones&#8230; and paddle toward the steeple.</p>
<p>Impossible to know time. Late. It&#8217;s getting late. When the next set comes, the children lurch over the outer sandbar, rolling ever nearer to the heaving ledges. On the fifth wave they come dangerously close to the ten-foot vertical wall. Mallory anchors her legs, Chase whips back like a seal, and they pull back in desperation.</p>
<p>&#8220;How are we supposed to take that drop?&#8221; Mallory says.</p>
<p>Chase has no answer. They drift in the vacancy between sets. The clouds dim to pink smoke, to ash. When the next set comes, they paddle hard for the fifth wave, and for a wild slashing instant they are soaring down its face, taking a high line, the rail of the board fully engaged.</p>
<p>Then Zephyrus, playful Zephyrus, strikes the wave, stretches it like a sail. The board helicopters and Mallory&#8217;s hands open and Chase tumbles over her head and the world woofs into a violence of green.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to learn how to take one on the head. That&#8217;s the first of all.&#8221; Bristled with sideburns, the father is a slightly less evolved animal than his little ones. &#8220;All you need to remember&#8230; are you listening? Two words. For when you take one on the head.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mallory can see his bright, apish eyes, can hear his voice now––two words––as she rag dolls in the spume, lungs screaming, shredded, sandblasted, sucked up and over the falls, smashed with a red scud to the sand. Two words to keep you from slipping away completely.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Go soft</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little girl huddles against the shellgrit, eyes closed, bubbles leaking from her lips. She lets her mind swim. <em>In death, the beauty and pureness of all reality, which is one.</em> She dies. She is released from the wheel. She resurrects into another sun, golden and hot, flooding her eyes. Chase is swimming away from her, glowing like an ember. She wants to call out for him, but she cannot stop the sound emitting from her throat.</p>
<p>How long was she under? She floats on her back, meditates on the veil of clouds, tries to calm her breaths, but the croaking persists, a frog sound, vibrato. Maybe she can slow it. Flusters of clouds, brushed dust. A hump or an aftershock of the set carries her up. She catches a dream-like glimpse of the shell necklace of the houses on the shore.</p>
<p>Mallory swims breaststroke toward her brother, still convulsing. His surfboard is beyond him, drifting out to sea. Zephyrus, still at work, teases it ahead, flicks it upside-down.<br />
Chase splashes after it. Who can know time? Only the dimming sky. The children reach the stray board together, monkey atop just as the next set wells up beneath.</p>
<p>Clutching and giving, kicking in circles, hands interlocked, she remembers her father&#8217;s reading of Lao Tzu: &#8220;In motion, be like water, at rest, like a mirror. Respond, like the echo, be subtle, as though non-existent.&#8221;</p>
<p>A lull now, an Atlantic fatigue, brought on by the coming of dusk. Chase rests his head on the deck. Sobs. Water plashes over his shoulders. The first Florida star, Vega––touchpoint of Orpheus&#8217;s lyre––glints high on the charcoal field. All color drains east. Band of emerald over kingdom of gold.</p>
<p>The sea smooths, grows weighty and slow. Cold ebony mounds, cavernous depths beneath. What now? Unable to confront the possibility of another takedown, the children hover in this fringe between sea and sky, fuzzed convergence of inky worlds.</p>
<p><em>Subito fortissimo</em>: an explosion of the water. A double discharge like musketfire. Enough to rattle the bones. Only a pelican, shivering out its beak. It flumps into the air, salutes, inspects them with wary eye, whispers north.</p>
<p>First comes the coldness. Ringing. White. An electric flow from the extremities inward. Screaming to the spine and neck. Even before the water fans to icicles, even before the hideous gleam of the white belly: the coldness. Chase is shouting, but his voice comes in muffles and echoes, bouncing at her as if from across a long corridor. She can see the stained water, red-green foam. Sees her brother ripping off his rashguard, twisting it. Sees her leg mouthed open in four or five places. Black, weeping wounds, the size of quarters. But it is the coldness that paralyzes her, makes it all so distant.</p>
<p>Chase is working the tourniquet, whimpering like a dog. The next wave billows in. He tightens the knot, takes Mallory by the arms. The chariot floods up, sinks achingly into the trough. They dance. Dark saline wine blooms on the rashguard. Five waves. He sets her bloody leg up on the board. Mallory, clenched all over, cannot feel her toes or fingertips. All legs on the deck. No words. Conservation of energy.</p>
<p>The tourniquet comes untied on the next set. Parted flesh, seep of blood. Chase blunders with the rashguard, reddens his hands, cannot seem to tie it. The little girl cracks through the cold, wrenches it taut.</p>
<p>Swimming shadows. Horror of violet dusklight. Another wave. Another.</p>
<p>When she can sustain no more, Mallory lies back on the board. The sea pities her. For a long while no waves come their way. Chase holds her stable. She sleeps.</p>
<p>When she wakes again, her mouth is sand, the sky a glistening plum. She sits up. Stabwounds in her right shin. Gibbous moon, low and dirty. How long was she out? Chase is shaking all over. The rashguard is black as the depths.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m hallucinating,&#8221; Chase says. &#8220;Look.&#8221;</p>
<p>Low on the star-field, a crown of gold light, embedded with dual rubies, sweeping the distance with roving white beam. Frumming, feeble, it vanishes its way.</p>
<p>&#8220;I need to lie down,&#8221; Chase says.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay,&#8221; Mallory tells him. The little boy eases back, shuts his eyes. They ride in delirium. Butterflies on the wind.</p>
<p>Later. Much later, the children lie braided on the deck, sleeping. Zephyrus has blown the sea flat, clean as lakewater. But a burble, a loose current, jostles them over, and they slip together into blackness.</p>
<p><em>Go soft</em>. Allow body to react unimpeded by mind. The lungs: balloons of air, suctions giving natural pull to the surface. She hoists herself up on the board. Chase, too. Alive, both children, under the wobbling lamp of the moon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nineveh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chase turns full round. &#8220;Do you hear that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Their oil-slicked backs cut mercury. Scythed silver dorsals. Telepathic spirits, blowholes ploofbreathing, eeping tickety sounds. They encircle the children. Slithery. The night sky breathes, throbs, wommm&#8230; wommm, celestial horizon brightening in slow casts of blue. The cetaceans roll and laugh, rapturous, spinning high-frequency wavelengths above the range of the ear.</p>
<p>Time? A spell cast by the body. Impossible to know how long before it comes––the white glint on the horizon, the shine of the fishing boat.</p>
<p>The water mammals blow joyously, dive deep.</p>
<p>The captain cuts the engine, tosses the ring over the starboard rail. The boy reaches out, takes hold. The captain hauls them in, lifts the little girl out of the water first, eases her onto white cushions.</p>
<p>Mallory wants to study him, this tanned stranger with his black ponytail and sunglasses, this man pouring water over her leg, over her elfin lips. She wants to understand him, but the corridor collapses.</p>
<p>When she opens her eyes again they are buzzing away from the light. The man at the console has his sunglasses off. He is speaking into the radio, another language. Japanese? She hoists herself into the breeze. A knife in her leg. But here is the water tower. And here is the air force base. And here, across the pink shallows: the small, sad people, some with stretchers, some in uniform, some in swimsuits. Her mother and father, poor lost creatures, wade out into the ocean. And the corridor again.</p>
<p>Warmth now, splashes. Cradled in the hot, hairy arms of the father, his gorilla face melted by sadness. Grunting, murmuring &#8220;my god, my god.&#8221; Feet squeaking on sand. The corridor.</p>
<p>A needle in her arm. Stingbite of pain. Tubes, pouches of liquid. Fleshmeat, torn and white. High-pitched whistle. Sleep.</p>
<p>Where is Chase? Here: stretched across the cold white corridor. His staccato voice backing the clink of wheels. She closes her eyes, and the dance continues. Surge and plummet of endless waves.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“I know how you’re gonna die.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say that, dude. I hate when people say creepy stuff like that.”</p>
<p>“Well, I do,” he says, turns right on Dixie.</p>
<p>My partner’s driving. We’re on the way to a bar for an unknown medical call, which, when it comes to bars, tends to mean a couple of patients with epistaxis. <em>Epistaxis</em> means bloody nose. We make the patient pinch his or her nose and lean forward. You’re not supposed to lean back, because the worry is aspirating. <em>Aspirating</em> means choking on your own blood.</p>
<p>We walk in. The floor is loud. Every step, it feels like crepitus. You can even hear it over the jukebox that’s a combination of emesis and Taylor Swift.</p>
<p>The floor’s covered with peanuts. I mean, thousands. Of shells. Thrown over the shoulders.</p>
<p>We ask them to turn down Ms. Swift and they don’t.</p>
<p>There’s a certain focus from everyone in the room that the guy in the center barstool is the one we want to be treating. We walk up and it’s the strangest thing I’ve ever seen—actually, I have to be careful with that; as a medic, I’ve seen a lot of crazy shit. I’ve seen a man decapitated by a moose. (There was nothing we could do.) I’ve seen a kid who jumped from the fifth floor of a building successfully into an outdoor motel pool only to have his foot get caught when it broke through a vent at the bottom. (Drowned. Nothing we could do.) I’ve seen a lady who—I could keep going. I’ll stop there. But a lot of crazy shit. Wait. No, I’ll tell you the lady story. It’s quick. She sneezed so hard one of her eyeballs popped out. That’s globe luxation. The only one I ever saw. We just covered her eyes with taped-on Dixie cups and told her to keep looking straight ahead.</p>
<p>But this guy’s got a ping pong ball in his mouth, blocking his airway.</p>
<p>We introduce ourselves to the patient and then ask his girlfriend if he can spit the ping pong ball out.</p>
<p>He shakes his head while she tells us she’s not his girlfriend.</p>
<p>I ask how many ping pong balls he has in his mouth.</p>
<p>Twice, I’ve been called to competitive eating contests that have gone bad. Once it was for hot dogs and once for cheese steaks. The cheese steak guy wanted to win a $100 grand prize and got CPR instead.</p>
<p>Our ping pong patient is starting to struggle, so my partner puts on one of his PPE gloves and goes to take the ball out of the man’s mouth. The man, though, is shaking his head no, to leave it in. But we tell him it has to come out.</p>
<p>My partner touches it and says it’s not a ping pong ball.</p>
<p>I ask what it is and he doesn’t know. He says it felt like a heart.</p>
<p>A human heart?</p>
<p>He says yeah.</p>
<p>Then something about the color makes me think it might be his tongue. I ask the patient if it is and he starts nodding like crazy.</p>
<p>And then he nods himself right off the barstool, passing out. He goes down. I’m looking for cyanosis. I’m ready for cardiac arrest and every bad thing you can imagine.</p>
<p>This is when my medic head starts spinning. Everything has to be fast. In medic school, sadly, the reality is you can get 80% on your tests and pass, which means that one in five of the things I’m supposed to know, I don’t. That’s pretty much across the board for all medics. We’ll get four out of five things right when we really need to be correct on everything.</p>
<p>But tongue inflammation as far as I remember is one of two things. One, snakebite.</p>
<p>I ask his wife if he’s been bitten by a snake.</p>
<p>No. And she’s not his wife.</p>
<p>Or two, food allergy. Does he have any food allergies?</p>
<p>She doesn’t know. She just happened to be in a barstool by him. We ask if anyone knows the guy. The crowd has gotten bigger. Medical scenes attract audiences. The problem is we want the opposite. The best thing for a patient is plenty of room, fresh air, a calm environment. Crowds are always bad. People smoke nearby, which isn’t helpful for someone having breathing trouble.</p>
<p>Then it sounds like fireworks are being lit off in one of the bathrooms, which makes about as much sense as trying to have a parade in a restroom.</p>
<p>I look at the patient lying in peanut shells and have a two-word revelation: peanut allergy. Index of suspicion. We prep the Epipen.</p>
<p>The woman asks if the needle is a needle.</p>
<p>We ignore her.</p>
<p>She starts saying she doesn’t want to see a needle go into—</p>
<p>But before she can finish, my partner jabs the black tip at a ninety-degree angle into the patient’s outer thigh, right through the clothing. He counts out loud to ten when a guy in a cowboy hat says to us with a thick London accent that there’s a guy shot in the loo.</p>
<p>No, I tell him, he’s not shot.</p>
<p>He says that, no, a guy is shot in the toilets.</p>
<p>I yell over the music that he’s not shot. At all.</p>
<p>And he starts talking to my partner, but my partner hates being interrupted when we have a patient, so the English cowboy comes back to me and says there’s someone else shot in the toilet. But his accent is so thick I’m not sure I’m hearing him right, especially with the Hank Williams Jr. drowning out thought.</p>
<p>I shout to the bartender to turn down Mr. Williams Jr. and he doesn’t.</p>
<p>I start to wonder if I should try to put an OPA in, see if I can get it by the ping pong tongue, but I see him looking at me, which is good. Unconscious patients tend not to blink. They tend not to sit up. Sometimes it’s having a needle jabbed in your thigh that can wake you up a bit. I’ve seen that with heroin addicts. We had one guy, he was overdosed to the point of drooling death and we hit him with Narcan and he popped up and ran right out of the ambulance with the needle still in his arm. The problem is that we have to keep track of all our needles, so I was chasing him down the street trying to get it back.</p>
<p>But ping pong tongue doesn’t need an OPA, because he’s talking, which is always a good sign with a patient. He says mush-mouthed, “Am I gon’ die?”</p>
<p>I say, “Are you alive right now?”</p>
<p>He says, “Yes,” so I tell him that’s a good sign, except I can tell he’s heading straight for shock. Shock is not vital signs. Shock is something you can see. It’s pale, cool, and diaphoretic and his skin is taking on ghost qualities. The whole concept of what ghosts look like comes from shock. We call it “going down the drain,” but it basically means your patient is going to die on you, which means a hell of a lot of paperwork, so I start to get the oxygen ready to pump as much into him as possible. Blow-by oxygen, nasal cannula, nonrebreather, BVM—hell, I want to have all of them going at once, if that was possible. And right when I’m untangling nonrebreather and fumbling with BVM, I see a guy wearing red pants walk up to us.</p>
<p>Except the red pants aren’t red pants. I can tell because they’re dripping. I look up to see a bariatric with Levis covered in blood.</p>
<p>I think I could use you, he says, and turns to show me the reddest part of his pants, the blood oozing out with each heartbeat.</p>
<p>This, by the way, is common in medicine, to end up with more than one patient.</p>
<p>Accidents create accidents.</p>
<p>You have a car accident and another one is likely to happen shortly. Drivers gawk at what’s going on and end up rear-ending the motorcyclist in front of them.</p>
<p>I tell the woman who isn’t married and isn’t his girlfriend to call 911 and she says, Aren’t you 911?</p>
<p>I tell my partner we’ll call it in once we get in the ambulance and we gurney up the ping pong tongue and start wheeling him out and suddenly it’s like a riot is going to happen. People start yelling that they’re going to kill us if we let the guy bleed to death on the bar floor, so I turn to my partner and he tells me, screw it, we’ll put both guys on the ambulance and call for a unit to meet us en route.</p>
<p>We’re not allowed to push a gurney by ourselves and we’re not allowed to ask anyone to help us—too much liability—so I ask the gunshot victim to walk along with us until we get to the ambulance, but I can see his footsteps of blood leading from the bathroom to where he is now. People are leaving that path wide open, not wanting to step in bloody footprints.</p>
<p>I figure he probably shot the bullet down into his leg, which is common with unintentional shootings. So I’m expecting an entrance wound and an exit wound. Exit wounds tend to be explosively larger than entrance wounds. And the way they’re making bullets nowadays, they tend to ricochet off bones, so the bullet can end up anywhere, not necessarily the straight-line path you might think. Who knows, maybe even hit the other leg as well. I tell him to lie down so I can find where he’s bleeding.</p>
<p>This, in the EMT world, is called Wednesday.</p>
<p>This isn’t abnormal. The normal, in emergency medicine, is the abnormal.</p>
<p>We wheel in our anaphylaxis patient, get him inside on the ambulance gurney and I tell my partner to watch his airway. With a patient like that, there’s only one thought—breathing, breathing, breathing.</p>
<p>I run back into the bar and the gunshot victim is still standing there. He’s doing nothing to try to stop the bleeding. He’s not lying down. He doesn’t even have his pants off so I can count bullet holes. So I take my shears out, which are basically big thick scissors, and a man tells the crowd that I’m going to cut the bullet out of his leg.</p>
<p>While I scissor his left pant leg completely off, a woman dressed all in pink—pants, shirt, hair, fingernails—tells me that I better make sure he doesn’t get an infection. As if I didn’t know this.</p>
<p>I’d love to sit down and have lengthy conversations with all of the passersby who, over the years, have offered me the most horrid of medical advice, to explain to them why what they’re recommending makes no physiological sense. But there’s no time to tell her that gunshots are actually too hot to bring infections. The incredible heat caused from the gunshot actually works as a sterilizer. If you ever want an area of your body to be completely sterile, shoot it with a handgun. We don’t take bullets out, because it’s hot lead, so it’s safe to stay in there, for now. And, only a doctor can do that anyway. You want to get fired really quickly, start doing surgery out in the field as an EMT. You’ll end up in prison as well.</p>
<p>When I have his pant leg in my hand, I look up and he says, Guns don’t kill people, rednecks kill people.</p>
<p>Gunshot victims, I’ve found, tend to have every single emotional reaction you can imagine. I’ve seen anger, humor, apathy, sadness. When you put a bullet in someone, their true personality comes out. This guy’s a natural bad comedian.</p>
<p>How you feeling? I ask him.</p>
<p>Like dancing.</p>
<p>Seriously, I say.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>This is what patients are supposed to say. Patients are put on Earth to lie to medics. Their entire purpose is to tell you they are perfectly healthy so that they can die on you. If you’re a smart medic, every person is inches from death. If you’re a smart medic and you find a person lying down in a park, they’re not sleeping; they fell from a plane. You always imagine the worst. And the worst for me now is finding out how many bullet holes we have. I count one. He’s got a major hole in his leg—medial, inferior. He’s lucky, because I’m not seeing the streams of blood that comes with arterial spurting. I had one guy who was like a fountain with his bicep. The blood shooting in amazing gushes, pausing, gushing, pausing, gushing with his heartbeat.</p>
<p>He’s all capillaries and venous bleeding. A dark red, an oozing.</p>
<p>It’s amazing he’s been able to walk on it. But my partner told me about a guy who had his feet cut off in an eight-car pile-up and was walking around on his tib-fibs, the second most insane thing he’s ever seen.</p>
<p>Our bariatric probably weighs about 400 pounds, so I want to lie him down and ask for some people to help get him to the floor, but no one wants to come near the guy, so I ask him to sit down again and he says he wants to stand.</p>
<p>I just stare at him and he asks what I’m doing, and I tell him I’m waiting for him to pass out so that I can start treating him. And this gets him to go down to the floor, with a lot of wincing, but now I don’t have to worry about him falling on top of me while I’m mid-gauze.</p>
<p>Emergency medicine can sometimes be painfully simple. The number one thing with a gunshot victim is to stop the bleeding. You’d think all gun owners would be well versed in first aid, being that they have this thing around them that’s made solely for destroying flesh. But the reality is none of them seem to have a clue what to do once they get shot.</p>
<p>Treating gunshot victims is a bit like factory work. We have a conveyer belt of these patients. I’m based out of Orlando and the amount of bullets flying around that city makes me wonder how Mickey Mouse’s ears have never taken a bullet. My old EMT school was based right in the heart of the murders for the city. The guy who bought the building got cheap rent. That’s because one day they found a corpse in our parking lot. That’s the funny thing about the U.S. Places like the White House and Disney Land, these great American landmarks, are really surrounded by nonstop murder.</p>
<p>I shout for the bartender if he could perhaps get some people out of the bar and turn the music down. He pours some shots for a group of weightlifters.</p>
<p>I control the bleeding. It’s a bit like trying to control your brother. It tends to do what it wants to do. And the problem here is I don’t know how many brothers I have. I start searching for the entrance wound, because there has to be one.</p>
<p>My partner comes in and tells me that we have a patient alone in the back of our ambulance and he could stop breathing at any time.</p>
<p>I ask if he’s radioed all this in and he nods yes like he hates the question.</p>
<p>He crouches, finds the entrance wound in one second.</p>
<p>Where?</p>
<p>He shows me the tiniest hole known to mankind.</p>
<p>You sure that’s a gunshot wound?</p>
<p>He looks at me like it’s the stupidest question in the world. It is. He’s right. Entrance wounds can be so small that it’s common for EMTs to deliver patients to the E.R. and completely miss them. Especially with all the blood.</p>
<p>We slap on all the sealant.</p>
<p>Pressure points are bullshit. You have a medic doing that, he’s caught up in the 1980s.</p>
<p>We’ve got QuickClot, which is a miracle drug. I’ve never had to do one single tourniquet in my life, although, trust me, I’m pro-tourniquet as all hell, but with natural vasoconstriction, luck, and Celox, bleeding, for me, is something that I’ve never had to worry about with a patient. I mean, the ones who lived.</p>
<p>My partner whisper-shouts, How the hell we getting this guy in the ambulance?</p>
<p>We aren’t. He needs a bariatric ambulance. We actually have ambulances made specifically for fat people. We have to. We can’t get them into regular ambulances. And obesity, from what I’ve seen, is becoming an art in America. Patients every year get fatter and fatter. And, a lot of people don’t know this, but the number one injury for EMT is lifting fat people. I’m not making that up. Research it. You’ll see it’s true. Back pain from lifting fat patients. I was down for a week after I blew out my back lifting a diabetic woman who weighed five hundred pounds and, keep in mind, she didn’t have any legs.</p>
<p>If I’m not sounding like the most tenderest, kindheartedest person when I talk about patients, you have to understand that they actually teach you to hate your patients in medic school. The instructors constantly make it so you see them the same way that cops see criminals. Patients have no problem getting you killed. Patients will give you the common cold and hepatitis and tuberculosis and not lose sleep over doing so. I used to cry about patients until one time my boss took me aside and told me I need to look at elderly people as animals, that I’ll end up committing suicide if I don’t see grandmothers as Siamese cats and grandfathers as miniature poodles. Sometimes we have to put them to sleep. It’s called cancer and heart disease and chronic lower respiratory disease. Stroke happens.</p>
<p>Is anybody coming?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>When?</p>
<p>My partner shrugs.</p>
<p>So?</p>
<p>We ask the patient if he’s good to go. If he can sit there until someone comes.</p>
<p>We say another unit’ll be coming shortly and we start to go.</p>
<p>And the bartender now suddenly acknowledges our presence, telling us we can’t leave the guy. He’s got 400 pounds on the floor, a liter of blood poured all over the place. The bar is nothing but blood and peanuts.</p>
<p>As we’re walking out the door, someone says, Just so you know, that guy’s HIV positive.</p>
<p>I turn, but I don’t know who said it.</p>
<p>My partner tells me to hurry, but I start asking the crowd who said that and my partner is about tugging me out the door when I say to hold on, I’m using the bathroom.</p>
<p>He says I must be kidding, but there aren’t any sinks in the back of ambulances. There’s no running water back there. It’s probably the stupidest thing about emergency medicine. If you want to save a ton of medics’ lives, do one simple thing: install a goddamn sink in the back of the ambulance. You puncture yourself with a needle or have a patient vomit in your eyes or put your hand down in a pool of blood, you’re screwed until you get to the hospital.</p>
<p>So I tell him I’m using the damn bathroom.</p>
<p>I crunch across the floor, avoiding the bloodstains, open up the door with the word AMIGO on it and a smiling sombrero that looks like it’s on fire and the first thing I see is the blood. The bathroom looks like a slaughterhouse storeroom. And I see legs on the floor inside one of the bathroom stalls.</p>
<p>I turn and crunch my way straight back to the front door.</p>
<p>I get into the ambulance, crawl up front, and my partner says, That’s abandonment.</p>
<p>I ignore him and tell my partner to radio in a murder.</p>
<p>What murder?</p>
<p>There’s a body in the pisser.</p>
<p>What pisser?</p>
<p>That fat guy shot somebody.</p>
<p>Himself.</p>
<p>And somebody in the goddamn bathroom. I try to keep my voice down. There’s no ping pong ball in the guy’s mouth anymore. He’s sitting up, one-hundred percent flow of O2. He looks ready to pinch hit for the Dodgers.</p>
<p>Did you treat him?</p>
<p>Who? The bathroom guy?</p>
<p>Hell no.</p>
<p>You didn’t do anything?</p>
<p>I got out of there. Scene safety. Drive!</p>
<p>He starts up the ambulance.</p>
<p>I go in back, making up vitals for the time when I was inside. We are firmly in lawsuit territory right now. We’re firmly set for a future in Quality Improvement hell.</p>
<p>The patient is doing fine. He’s 122-ish systolic. A little high, perfectly in range. He’s twenty breaths a minute. A little fast, perfectly in normal range. He’s 100 bpm. Little high, normal range. All those numbers mean nothing. What matters now is change. What matters now is inclining or declining. What matters now is change.</p>
<p>I remember the HIV comment. I have a moment to think. Vital signs for a guy like this are done every fifteen minutes. I tend to do them every five for every patient. I usually take nonstop vitals. Just in case. Except if a patient complains. If a patient says, Don’t touch me, then I don’t touch them.</p>
<p>But I take a minute to get some alcohol swabs. I rub my hands. I check for blood on me. I find a speck on my wrist. I look at it.</p>
<p>I get minimum wage.</p>
<p>I’m a bit fat myself.</p>
<p>I don’t have a girlfriend. Or a boyfriend. Or, in fact, a friend. Not here. In California, where I was born, I have plenty. But here, in Orlando, I don’t hang out with a single person.</p>
<p>I shout up to my partner, saying, So, how am I going to die?</p>
<p>I hear him laugh.</p>
<p>I look out the back of the ambulance. I remember something my EMT instructor told me. He said, Orlando—it’s a good place to die. Good as any.</p>
<p>My partner yells back, Maybe that guy in the bathroom was just drunk.</p>
<p>Passed out.</p>
<p>I feel a sense of relief until I realize he probably fell out of a plane. Being passed out in a bathroom spells death. Part of me wants to go back, but there’s never any going back.</p>
<p>We drive.</p>
<p>Well, I say.</p>
<p>Well what?</p>
<p>How’m I going to die?</p>
<p>He shouts back, It’s simple. However your parents die, that’s how you’re gonna die. It’s all heredity. They’re doing studies, catching cancer before people get it, because their father’s colon cancer warned ‘im it was coming. Medicine is magic, he shouts.</p>
<p>I think of catching my death before it happens.</p>
<p>I see the Jesus amusement park pass by, the constant car sickness I have from this job, watching the cars tailgate us so that they can speed.</p>
<p>The Holy Land Experience passes in a flash. I heard that one of the guys who plays Jesus there gets laid a lot. I heard he’s a big pot-head, that he’s done acid so many times that some doctors would declare him legally insane. I heard that he’s a really nice guy though, mellow. But there’s a lot of bullshit talk in the break room back at the base station. Who knows what’s true?</p>
<p>Funny thing though is the EMT who’s friends with the fake Jesus said that I remind her of him. She said I’d make a good Jesus if I could lose the weight and start smoking pot. She said it’s hard to get hired there though, that you really have to be good at faking like you’re a Christian.</p>
<p>A family that looks scared gawks in through the ambulance’s back window at me. I stare back at them, the sun blinding, perfect for a car accident, and I think of myself delivering the Sermon on the Mount for minimum wage, my robe as clean as all hell.</p>
