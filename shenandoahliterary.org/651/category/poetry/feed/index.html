								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I could get up from this kitchen table, I think,<br />
and go see for myself whether, even how,<br />
in the worn planks of the old barn floor<br />
there might still be the two holes I saw made there<br />
forty years ago, in a single second along<br />
the ponderous time-line of farming. Well,</p>
<p>I might get over there one of these days.<br />
Meanwhile, what can I see from here? We entered<br />
the barns second story through a big sliding door<br />
at the top of an earthen ramp. There was a haymow<br />
on either side of a wagon-wide aisle -way.<br />
A rail under the ridgepole ran gable to gable.</p>
<p>High in a dark far end, when I was a boy,<br />
the old hayfork still hung there barely visible<br />
in cobwebs and thin strips of sunlight<br />
that burst between weathering boards. Shaped<br />
like a three-foot inverted U, a giant staple,<br />
it rusted toward absolute darkness against which</p>
<p>stark blobs left by last season’s mud was<br />
stood out like white spots on a heifer.</p>
<p>Who knew how long it had been there? Loose hay<br />
was giving way to bales before I was born,<br />
though here and there I’ve seen it made, the teams<br />
of work-horses pulling the loader and wagon,</p>
<p>a man with a pitchfork working everyday magic<br />
on top of the rack, the slow ride to the barn,<br />
drawing the load up under the rail and the trip-stop.<br />
A man dragged the fork down, hauling against<br />
the two-rope’s weight the forty punts of steel<br />
with two barbed ends that grabbed the wads of hay.</p>
<p>Then the team, unhitched from the wagon, pulled<br />
on the two-rope, moving away from the bard,<br />
lifting the hay toward the roof. A click<br />
as the trolley-hook caught, then the hay<br />
rode back along the rail into the mow<br />
where men forked it away for the winter.</p>
<p>So to a day when I was twelve or thirteen,<br />
when the baled hay we were making was plentiful,<br />
stacked in the mow almost up to the roof,<br />
and we were standing around in the aisle-way<br />
after the wagon backed out, catching breath,<br />
getting ready to go back to the field. One man</p>
<p>up in the mow took a notion and snatched<br />
at the tag-end of rope twill fastened to the hayfork,<br />
so it whirred down the track to a place just above<br />
the middle of the aisle-way, hit the tripe, and dropped,<br />
all faster, it seemed then the noise of the track<br />
could make us look up, and plunged its two points</p>
<p>into the floor just beside the left foot of Joe Trammel,<br />
who stood there, leaning away from it, looking down<br />
and then up, and round at all of us, a barnful<br />
of men struck reverently silent in the presence of<br />
whatever it was, the good luck that kept Joe<br />
from injury, the bad luck that gave him his worst scare</p>
<p>in years, the innocent thoughtlessness that led<br />
to that heat yank on the rope, the way things can go<br />
for years without happening, biding their time<br />
in a dust-whirling, cobwebby barn I can see<br />
and smell and hear right now, staring down<br />
at the grain in the wood of this kitchen table.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>September, 1926, clear</em></p>
<p>He had before come courting – with pecans<br />
or peaches, berries. She had those times been able<br />
to thank him with one of her pies and be<br />
done with him. For this, though, he would want<br />
supper, to sit at the table with her<br />
after supper. For this, she reckoned he had<br />
spent most of the morning emptying<br />
the sky of its plenty: the doves spilled from<br />
burlap in iridescent disarray,<br />
three dozen at least, a shimmering</p>
<p>bouquet. And so the afternoon was for her<br />
defined; the hour deepened the mound of feathers,<br />
blue-grey, plucked in porch-dusk, and the wind,<br />
disinterested, would once in a while stir them.<br />
She knew they were easy to bring down<br />
over a field where they would fall into<br />
the tangled grasses and go on on flying against<br />
what had been wind. Easy – as this was not:<br />
feet, gut, heart, the smooth brow with eyes open<br />
like garnets glowing; she cut and tossed over</p>
<p>and over what was in the end useless<br />
onto the feathers, a last and bloody bed<br />
or to the cats, who growled and circled her,<br />
to keep the peace. A dove would amount to,<br />
at best, a half-dozen mouthfuls, the dark<br />
breast tender but grizzled with shot – black seed.<br />
She threw a whole bird to the nursing cat<br />
and wondered whether the white kitten had opened<br />
its eyes; if they were blue, it would be deaf,<br />
she had been told and told she could not let it</p>
<p>live. She would see about that. Her mother called down<br />
how are they coming. More work than they’re worth,<br />
she answered back, for such a little meat.<br />
Even with the birds still baking, yet to be<br />
eaten, with still the biscuits to stir up<br />
and gravy yet to make from the meager fat –<br />
with a strait hour to pass before he would<br />
lean back from the table to pick his teeth and sigh –<br />
she had decided he should have left the doves<br />
their beloved sky, for she would not be won.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A bee colony,<br />
black hole<br />
in a split juniper trunk.<br />
Gnarled, rough mounds of bark<br />
guard a slash of buzzing dark.</p>
<p>Wild bees delight,<br />
work and hover –<br />
dive into an artificial night.<br />
They pass each other<br />
to cover cones with stolen nectar.</p>
<p>This could be the last bee tree<br />
in a food chain of cultivated<br />
colonies. Bee homebodies<br />
thrive – imports mingle<br />
without improvement,</p>
<p>and migrants sicken, shipped<br />
on flatbeds cross-country.<br />
No swarm, only purposeful acts<br />
in a daylong dance to and fro.<br />
The gash of hive is low</p>
<p>on the trunk, the whole<br />
secret two feet high.<br />
This fir, bearing cones<br />
like shrunken blueberries,<br />
with bark striations of whitish gray,</p>
<p>resembles a faded fence post<br />
more than a living tree.<br />
Inside there is a kingdom<br />
waiting to collapse<br />
on a queen so plump with life</p>
<p>she cannot see the danger<br />
of such sweetness. Expanding<br />
honey cores the juniper,<br />
as sinkholes honeycomb the comet’s<br />
nucleus until it cries out,</p>
<p>its coma burning bigger than Jupiter.<br />
17P/Holmes explodes gas<br />
and dust as the sun strikes it.<br />
To the eye, a fuzzy spot enlivens<br />
Perseus. To the lazy</p>
<p>bees, tucked into a moon-lit tree<br />
it is nothing. Soon, it is nothing.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Inside the infant<br />
is already the path they will travel.<br />
It is how the newly born<br />
will grow to become a woman, a man,<br />
salvaged from other lives and worlds,<br />
and a heart that never rests.</p>
<p>How something is made flesh<br />
no one can say. The buffalo soup<br />
becomes a woman<br />
who sings every day to her horses<br />
or summons another to her private body<br />
saying come, touch.<br />
This is how<br />
it begins<br />
and the gathered berries,<br />
the wild grapes<br />
enter the body<br />
to become<br />
human wine<br />
which can love<br />
where nothing created is wasted<br />
the swallowed grain<br />
takes you through the dreams<br />
of another night,<br />
the deep meat becomes hands<br />
strong enough to work.</p>
<p>But I love the most<br />
The white-haired creature<br />
eating green leaves.<br />
The sun shines there<br />
Swallowed, showing in her face<br />
taking in all the light,</p>
<p>and in the end<br />
when the shadow from the ground<br />
enters the body and remains,<br />
in the end, you still might say,<br />
this is myself<br />
still unknown, still a mystery.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Of the one instant we might die in, if we consider it,<br />
it has not yet happened or it is too late, and what<br />
seems to remain of it after an hour misses the point,<br />
and twenty years after it is like twenty years before:<br />
a mud dauber buzzing, the burn smell of the miter saw,<br />
some warp in the quotidian where our talk<br />
migrated to the Steelers, midmorning light<br />
striped and angled by the odd bunching of the shades.</p>
<p>That the husband was sick, gravely ill, we did not know yet<br />
Or much of that place beyond the hardwood floor,<br />
tongue and groove red oak in nearly flawless condition,<br />
which I had bought for a dollar a foot<br />
and that we were prying up from the underlayment<br />
of the house the couple had moved out of into a trailer<br />
where they were living while the carpenters<br />
framed in the new house across the road.</p>
<p>From all we could see, he was just thin, nothing extraordinary<br />
In his talk, a young farmer with an education.<br />
She was the one who got our attention,<br />
large and blond, easy with others and herself.<br />
If you read <em>Beowulf</em> and come to the place<br />
Where Wealhtheow, Hrothgar’s queen, moves among the men,<br />
pouring mead in the great hall, there is the grace I mean.<br />
And where could we go with that?</p>
<p>Only that a respect accrued from watching her<br />
tow a wagon across the lawn, pivot, and back it into the barn.<br />
A pleasure to see her hoeing or petting the dog.<br />
And when she spoke, a lightness to her voice, no hint –<br />
Though later we would agree we should have known,<br />
so gray was his face, so drawn his mouth<br />
when he dropped by, saying how his mother had kept the house,<br />
the kitchen spotless, the floor always shiny and lemon scented.</p>
<p>Or perhaps we denied it or knew subliminally,<br />
wedging a crowbar under each board, leaning back<br />
and rocking gently to save the wood from splintering –<br />
the Midwest cocked outside, the wind carving runnels in the wheat<br />
and farther, the identical fields repeating, the houses,<br />
clean and functional, each with its outbuildings,<br />
farm implements, and farrowing pens – and then<br />
one day he said, “This hospital shit is bad for business.”</p>
<p>The good humor of a dying man is worth something.<br />
I do not say what. We took the floor. Courage?<br />
Beauty? – Leukemia, she said, bone marrow –<br />
but not like sorrow, more like the dust<br />
shaken from the boards by the violence of the saw,<br />
the particles before us, distinct, then invisible.<br />
More tests, she said, and hope – the evidence<br />
was there in the rooms going up across the field.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She was all in black but for a yellow pony tail<br />
that trailed from her cap, and bright blue gloves<br />
that she held out wide, the feathery fingers spread,<br />
as surely she stepped, click-clack, onto the frozen<br />
top of the world. And there, with a clatter of blades,<br />
she began to braid a loose path that broadened<br />
into a meadow of curls. Across the ice she swooped<br />
and then turned back and, halfway, bent her legs<br />
and leapt into the air the way a crane leaps, blue gloves<br />
lifting her lightly, and turned a snappy half-turn<br />
there in the wind before coming down, arms wide,<br />
skating backward right out of that moment, smiling back<br />
at the woman she’d been just an instant before.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>two roistering dogs splayed me flat<br />
on frozen turf shattering six ribs<br />
consigning me to gray walls, bleak thoughts<br />
I’m up and about, hitching from place to place</p>
<p>and I see the common coarse-grained stones<br />
have not given up their good seats in the wall<br />
though the deckle-edged daffodils came and went<br />
while I motored my rented bed up and down</p>
<p>and I see the greening margin along the road<br />
is shaggy and unshorn and the goldfinches<br />
have exchanged their winter costumes<br />
for strobic lozenges of yellow that brighten</p>
<p>the window feeder and an indigo<br />
bunting has brought his electric blue<br />
to my sphere so that each time the rose-<br />
breasted grosbeak alights for a sunflower chip</p>
<p>I am stunned into wholeness, healed<br />
by a wheel of primary colors.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How could it be that none of us saw it<br />
when we were there all of us that one time<br />
standing with our arms around each other<br />
smiling it had been so long since we<br />
had been together perhaps we scarcely<br />
noticed anything else in the ancient<br />
beautiful city we had loved before<br />
in the old days not thinking about it<br />
most of the time while we lived there those carved<br />
heads at the corners of high roofs the domes<br />
shining beyond them did any of us<br />
know there were overhead all the time<br />
who was it we got to take the picture<br />
of all of us with our backs to it<br />
not seeing it who did we find to look<br />
at us there in the narrow street waiting<br />
for the flash no doubt a complete stranger<br />
was that how we appeared to a stranger<br />
was it visible then to a stranger<br />
the great square just at the end of the street<br />
behind us opening to tall facades<br />
caught in the sunlight as in a shining cloud<br />
and directly in line with us as we<br />
stood there so that it seems to be rising<br />
out of us the statue of those enormous<br />
figures reaching upward the horse; hooves<br />
climbing the air with mouths op en only<br />
now do we seem them whoever they are</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All night crackling camp-fires boosted their morale<br />
As they dozed in no man’s land and the killing fields.<br />
(There are balmy nights – not a breath, constellations<br />
Resplendent in the sky around a dazzling moon –<br />
When a clearance high in the atmosphere unveils<br />
The boundlessness of space, and all the stars are out<br />
Lighting up hill-tops, glens, headlands, vantage<br />
Points like Tonakeera and Allaran where the tide<br />
Turns into Killary, where salmon run from the sea,<br />
Where the shepherd smiles on his luminous townland.<br />
That many camp-fires sparkled in front of Ilium<br />
Between the river and the ships, a thousand fires,<br />
Round each one fifty men relaxing in the fire-light.)<br />
Shuffling next to the chariots, munching shiny oats<br />
And barley, their horses waited for the sunrise.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<pre>Seven white butterflies
delicate in a hurry look
how they bang the pages
   of their wings as they fly

to the fields of mustard yellow
and orange and plain
gold all eternity
   is in the moment this is what

Blake said Whitman said such
wisdom in the agitated
motions of the mind seven
    dancers floating

even as worms toward
paradise see how they banter
and riot and rise
    to the trees flutter

lob their white bodies into
the invisible wind weightless
lacy willing
    to deliver themselves unto

the universe now each settles 
down on a yellow thumb on a 
brassy stem now
    all seven are rapidly sipping

from the golden tower who
would have thought it could be so easy?
