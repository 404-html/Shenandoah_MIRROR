								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each of us bridesmaids hated the others. We milled around the bride, pinning flowers in her hair. We pulled other flowers out to put ours in. The maid of honor was the bride’s sister, but she was the most useless of them all; she looked out the window at the sky we were missing. Earlier, the groomsmen had held doors open for us, served us patient, patronizing smiles while we stepped on their toes to gather our things. As soon as we left we heard them laughing. Everything must be perfect, the bride said. She was crying. What a show you’re putting on, said the sister. You don’t even believe in it anymore. What does it mean, this show of a promise? This deflated tradition?</p>
<p>We thought about this. The bride cried harder.</p>
<p>But then we’d spent too long thinking, the daytime moon sliding magnetic tentacles around our hearts so we all beat in sync, listening to each other, waiting for the slightest thump to step out of line. It was the sister who spoke first. I can’t breathe, she said. I can’t move.</p>
<p>We blinked. The moon had dragged night around us. We’d all missed the wedding. All we could do was fall over on each other and lay like dolls against the wall. My cheek was mashed against the sister’s mouth. She breathed hot into my ear. Why do you all hate me so much? she asked, I’m down here with the rest of you. She blinked her eyelashes against my forehead.</p>
<p>None of us can move. We are all facing the ceiling so we can’t see the door. We hear sounds of the wedding reception continuing anyways. Finally, I see in the window the reflection out the door. There’s a whole ballroom out there, way more than the bride could afford. The groom is taking the first dance with a floor-length mirror in his arms, but the mirror cuts him at the edges. He looks perfect, we all agree. The bride’s make-up has run completely down her face, and out of the corner of our eyes, we see she was never the bride, she was always the wolf, the one who eats everything we can give until we are consumed, the one we tell, How big your eyes are, clear as emeralds, How beautiful your mouth, glistening like rubies, Your teeth sharp as diamonds. If we could skin the wolf and wear her pelt we would.</p>
<p>But the night is cold, so we press our dresses up to her for warmth. We can move our arms now, but not much more. The sister curls her hand around a fragment of mirror, blade thin as a knife. It hurts to hold, she whispers to me. She brandishes the knife towards the wolf’s stomach. She’s going to dig her sister out.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Selena made it sound easy. All I had to do was place a pancake in my palm, high-five her, and repeat some sort of mantra. We were at IHOP, in a window booth, waiting for my food.</p>
<p>“Then what?” I asked, breaking into giggles. Selena was so weird.</p>
<p>“Then nothing, darling. That’s it. You’re ordained.” She winked, mixed ice water in her coffee. She was on her third cup. I like to count things, keep track.</p>
<p>Selena had found me earlier outside the Greyhound station. I say found because it was two in the morning and I was stuck in Vegas, broke, sober and bored, which was just about as lost as I’d ever imagined myself. The bus had broken down, something wrong with the radiator. New parts were on the way. The other passengers who’d ridden from Sacramento were either sleeping in the station or gambling at the Plaza next door. To kill time, I went outside and counted the burned-out bulbs in the Plaza’s flashing sign. If you’re wondering why I didn’t walk the Strip to see the sights, you must not be familiar with Greyhound stations—always at the edge of town, nowhere near the fun and games—and for this I congratulate you on the choices you’ve made in life.</p>
<p>I’d counted thirty-one burned-out bulbs when a guy in cowboy boots shuffled up. Grey skin, a hacking cough. “Hey boss,” he said, “bum a smoke?”</p>
<p>That I wasn’t smoking made me think he was interested in more than cigarettes, and in this I was correct. He asked all the usual questions: how old are you? What do fellas call you? Where you headed? How much for your love? I knew from his voice that he thought I was a boy. I get it a lot from men. I don’t blame them. Folks see what they want.</p>
<p>Selena appeared right then, threw her arm around me like an old pal. “I’m starving,” she said. Her heels clacked as she marched us down the sidewalk. “You like IHOP?”</p>
<p>The pancake squelched between our hands. Selena knitted her fingers with mine, squeezed harder. Syrup dripped on the table with that velvety patter you’d recognize from melting candle wax. The waitress yawned behind the counter.</p>
<p>Once I stopped giggling I repeated Selena’s mantra. <em>Pancakes of everything, of everything pancakes.</em></p>
<p>According to her, I was now a Pancake High Priestess.</p>
<p>She didn’t bother with a napkin before going back to her coffee. She watched the flash of my fork and knife as I dug in. “You’re gonna be good at this, darling. I can tell.”</p>
<p>She had a decade on me. Early thirties, I would’ve wagered. Long black braids. Thick lips. Amber sea glass eyes. Stylish skirt, jacket. Very pretty. You might’ve called her a lipstick lesbian, but I don’t think you’d be right. I’ve learned to read people. Friendly, older women used to take me in. Turns out they’re not always so friendly. My memory has snipped the worst frames from the reel. For this, I suppose I ought to be more grateful. What I’d become was weary. But Selena didn’t care where I was headed, where I was from. Didn’t ask my name. These acts of charity made me the most grateful of all.</p>
<p>She rattled the ice in her mug. “Darling, you know Spanish for bread?”</p>
<p>“Pan,” I said. Everybody knows Spanish for bread.</p>
<p>“Bingo. What about Greek for all?”</p>
<p>I looked down at my plate. Eat the center of a stack of pancakes and what you’re left with is a crater to fill with syrup. You probably know this trick already, but the novelty was new to me.</p>
<p>“Pan also happens to be the name of the old goat god who looked after the wilds and the nymphs.” She waved her spoon overhead as if it were a lasso and there was a calf that needed roping. “All around us, both sticky and sweet. Nothing wrong with that.”</p>
<p>Then she glanced at the wall clock, cursed. “I’m on, in ten, darling, gotta scamper.”  She stood and blew me a kiss.</p>
<p>A twenty fluttered from her handbag as she left. I knew before the bill touched the table that I would take that object of Selena’s and make it mine. I felt sorry for the waitress. I did. But there were other things for which I felt so much more.</p>
<p>Hustling back to the Greyhound station, the blinking sign of the Plaza set my mind to the roulette wheel. Selena’s twenty plus one decent streak of luck was everything I needed in the world. You might say I ought to have known better, and ordinarily I’d agree. But let me tell you about me and luck. By my accounting, I had lots owed me, heaps of good fortune due my way.</p>
<p>Suddenly this young kid, my age, his face one big blister of a sunburn, sidled up to me and spilled his story, as if I’d begged to hear it.</p>
<p>He’d hoofed it from Bakersfield. Five days on foot in the name of love. His girl had left him, moved away. He figured he’d prove himself by walking to her. Nearly passed out in the Mojave earlier that day. Had to stand at the roadside, his thumb to heaven, praying for an angel to sweep him up. As these tales always go, one angel did.</p>
<p>I waited for the real proselytizing to begin, but the kid only grinned. I looked him over. No bags. Just his peeling face, his ratty sneakers. I didn’t doubt a word.</p>
<p>I asked him, “So what’d she say? Your girl. You win her back?”</p>
<p>“Won’t know till St. Louis. She’s waiting for me there.”</p>
<p>His pilgrimage had hardly begun. I briefly considered giving him my bus ticket. The forces we try to control. The lessons we’d love to learn.</p>
<p>“You hungry?” I said, thumbing Selena’s twenty. I nodded back in the direction of IHOP.<br />
“You gotta be starving.”</p>
<p>“Well sure,” he said. “Sure I am.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I.<br />
David and his grandfather walked through Blenheim Forest looking for May apples, the first sign of spring. His grandfather moved slowly, his bowed legs more wobbly than ever.</p>
<p>When he was younger, David thought his body was fueled by tiny men inside him, ironing clothes or tending to their small homes. When two or more of them grew tired or ill, so would David. As they rallied, so would he. Later he learned that the body was muscle, blood and bones and eventually it would let you down.</p>
<p>Hal showed David how to look for the sponge-like shapes of morel mushrooms under tulip poplars and pinch off their tops to preserve the root system.</p>
<p>He taught David how to play dominoes and about the bone yard, where you pick from the remaining tiles.</p>
<p>“Life is all about choices,” Hal would say, selecting a tile.</p>
<p>Hal dropped salted peanuts in the shell into his bottle of coke and drank off the fizz before it spilled over onto the table. David did the same, though he didn’t care for peanuts in the shell.</p>
<p>David loved the woods, the humming of insects, the birdsong, and the fact that he could hear their footfalls as they walked.</p>
<p>“May apple, also called mandrake, racoonberry, and witches umbrella. The fruit makes a sweet jelly, but the root can kill you,” his grandfather said.</p>
<p>David scanned the forest floor.</p>
<p>“Right there?” he asked, pointing.</p>
<p>“That’s it.”</p>
<p>There was a small forest of green umbrellas. Plump seed pods peeked out from below the leaves. As they walked toward the May apples a slow rain began to fall.</p>
<p>II.<br />
David had been an average student until sixth grade art class. Mrs. Snyder held up his work, raising her arms in the air and with it the hem of her dress. David was pretty sure only the girls in class noticed his drawing.</p>
<p>His art set him apart. He didn’t like being different. It was one thing to be a good athlete, but an artist?</p>
<p>His grandfather was different too. He didn’t go to church or believe in God.</p>
<p>This scared David. He thought that God would be just like his grandfather, tall and commanding with a deep knowledge of nature. God would know just what to say, like his grandfather, who told him last week out of the blue that it was OK to be special.</p>
<p>David drew a picture of a forest full of flowers and trees, a clearing with a table covered with dominoes, a single peanut by a bottle of Coke, his grandfather’s heaven. Then he realized he’d left his grandfather out of the picture.</p>
<p>III.<br />
David started with a paint-by-numbers kit. He was amazed those small patches of color actually looked like something. He substituted black for yellow and red for black. The colors created shadows that gave contrast and depth to the image.</p>
<p>He would be on the ball field and notice the contours of the ball as it flew through the air, the play of light on the dust motes that got kicked up when someone stole second base.</p>
<p>His class went to the Speed Museum in Louisville to see French Impressionist paintings, David stared at a dab of white paint at the bottom of a glass. Up close it was a spot of paint, five feet back it was the French sun reflecting off the bottom of a glass of red wine.</p>
<p>When David looked at his grandfather, he wanted to pick up his paintbrush and add the muscle and flesh of a younger man.</p>
<p>IV.<br />
Fire Tower trail was marked by faded strips of red ribbon tied to trees. David heard the movement of the leaves, waves of sound from the cicadas, and his grandfather’s breathing, heavier than usual. He slowed down to let him catch up.</p>
<p>David opened his canteen, held it out and watched as his grandfather braced himself on a tree, tilted his head back and took a long swallow.</p>
<p>“Want to rest?&#8221;</p>
<p>“Let’s go on.”</p>
<p>David listened to the wheezing breath and tried to visualize his grandfather’s lungs, the air moving in and out. He saw an accordion, bright red with black bellows.</p>
<p>David could see the stairs to the fire tower. From the top they could see the forest canopy, Mount May in the distance and the jelly bean shape of Lake Devon.</p>
<p>“Help me, boy,” his grandfather said, just before he fell to the ground. David ran to get the park ranger. When the ranger asked for his grandfather’s name, David drew a blank for a minute.</p>
<p>“It is Hal, Hal Emerson.”</p>
<p>V.<br />
David stood in front of a blank canvas. His grandfather was in the county hospital, his heart rhythm as a series of jagged lines on a monitor. While his grandfather slept, David had tried not to stare at the machine.</p>
<p>He picked up his paintbrush and mixed a yellow, the color of corn silks.</p>
<p>His grandfather had taken him into the cornfield when he was small, held him level with the plants and taught him how to check for holes left by sugarcane beetles.</p>
<p>David ran his brush across the canvas, making a cornfield where there was nothing before. The field blurred before him.</p>
<p>VI.<br />
David stood next to his parents in the graveyard. All around him were the trees and the birds that his grandfather had taught him about: purple ash and sugar maple, barn swallow and finch.</p>
<p>David thought about all the paths he would walk alone from now on. His mind wandered to the May apples, their tiny umbrellas, their poisonous root.</p>
<p>His grandfather told him that everything fell apart eventually.  He&#8217;d shown him mold underneath fall leaves.  &#8220;You&#8217;ll never feel more alive than on a fall day surrounded by decay,&#8221; he&#8217;d said.</p>
<p>David would be there in the fall.  He&#8217;d finish the painting of the field, filling the canvas from edge to edge.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At first everyone thought it was a joke that might have appealed to a Berliner with gallows humor or some latter-day Kafka, lacking the Gallic touch. Surrealism, after all, had been long defunct, and the antics of Pataphysics had always struck sophisticates as uncouth, more apt for an armadillo or orangoutang. Still, the Siberian tiger stalking the back alleys of the City of Light was an irrefragable fact.</p>
<p>It was glimpsed by street cleaners and bakers’ apprentices on their way to work, when the gutters still glistened in the early morning and mist clung to lamp posts under a mauve sky. Glimpsed not in plausible places, say close to the Jardin des Plantes or in the Bois de Boulogne, or even among the lichened tombstones of Père Lachaise, but slinking around the chaste arcades of the Palais Royal. Even so, the creature could be spotted in one night at two ends of the city, in the ethnic slums of La Courneuve and among the lofty villas of Versailles, as if searching desperately for its home in the taiga.</p>
<p>Oh, the tiger was real: it left steaming scat along its inscrutable path. But the rumors it generated became phantasmagoric. Some fancied the animal had come to remind Parisians of Viking raiders rowing silently down the Seine in ships with dragon prows; others sullenly recalled the leather-coated Gestapo during the Occupation. (Patriots identified the tiger with Jean Moulin and the heroic Resistance.) Intellectuals argued it was an emblem of Existentialism, though none saw the big cat near the Café Flore or Les Deux Magots. Many looked on it with nostalgia as the spirit of May &#8217;68. Old pieds noirs saw it as a revenant of the Algerian War. The influx of immigrants, the ravages of tourists, global warming, even the early elimination of the French team from the World Cup—all featured as grist for the mills of fantasy.</p>
<p>Not that the tiger had mangled or devoured anyone. Despite its bright eyes and burning stripes, despite its razor claws and horrific fangs, it glided through Paris like an ancient portent, like a nocturnal breeze. After the initial terror, <em>panthera altaica</em> became a romantic icon like the Phantom of the Opera or the Hunchback of Notre Dame. But with this difference: La Bête de Paris, as everyone now called it, appeared to every resident in a dream. Appeared only once, never leaving two persons with the same impression or mood.</p>
<p>The effects of this apparition were subtle and pervasive. Citizens became… what? Rude, impatient, egotistic? These epithets, current among disgruntled visitors, failed to capture the influence of the tiger. It was as if the human eye had turned into a mirror, capable only of reflecting pitilessly the world.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>End of a young day in the bog<br />
A bee stung my lip, punishment for staring for hours into tomb-shaped holes full of black water, after being warned not to. Going home I lay on the leather seats and watched the trees close over the car. Milk still bubbly from the cow lay in big lemonade bottles at our feet. Father told a story about setting a frog as bait in a bog hole and catching a pike with an eel through its fin. ‘All the bogholes and lakes down home are linked up,’ he said. Married ten years, he still called the farm ‘down home.’<br />
*<br />
Cousins from the city<br />
Cousins from the city who were bigger and older than us stood by their car, anxious to leave, making dirty jokes we were too young to get. It was duskish, and the two sets of parents were having urgent conversations in the kitchen door: about their own parents, deaths, illness, money, jobs. Nothing as exciting as mysterious jokes about sex.<br />
*<br />
Summer job<br />
I assisted Mike who worked in the yard at the back of the bottling hall, dealing with full bottles past their sell-by date, which had been collected from bars. The boys in the rattling-tinkling bottling hall said that Mike drank as much as he could from the bottles during the day. They considered this proof that the sell-by thing was just another capitalist trick.<br />
*<br />
A spell abroad<br />
The scent from the huge Cestrum Nocturnum was sweet and sickly. Gabrielle called it Gallant de la nuit and said it gave her a headache. I said eating it made you trippy. Suddenly the muezzin sang out from the little tower of the nearest mosque, then quickly others echoed in the distance. I knew that someday somewhere I would miss this call and this moment.<br />
*<br />
Foreigners<br />
She complained of the noisy people who’d invested the expensive apartment above theirs, with kids and maids and wedding festivals. She’d never dreamed such people could have the kind of money needed to purchase in their building. For a while she was sure they were only renting, until the father turned up, dark and mute, at a building meeting. ‘Those restaurants must pay well,’ she said, as she shook the small man’s hand.<br />
*<br />
Going to A&amp;E<br />
The young man hurried after the woman down the corridor towards Accident and Emergency. &#8220;Jingle Bells&#8221; seeped out of the public address speakers. “I’ll slice you,” the man shouted. The young woman ignored him. A passing white-coat paused, stared, then pressed on his way down the corridor. He’d have enough work to do when the pair arrived where they were headed.<br />
*<br />
Trust<br />
His name was O’Brien or McMahon. Something Irish. He held his drink better than her. He was a doctor. He said if she held her breath the air would keep her up and that’s how she learned to keep herself afloat while criss-crossing a private pool under a blinding desert sun. She was three sheets to the wind, as she was for most of that summer. This too may have kept her from drowning.<br />
*<br />
Route bis, Béziers to Collioure<br />
Sunday morning, as we leave Béziers behind, the road is lined with whores. The first, dowdily dressed, looks like a nun whose car broke down, although no car is visible. At each gap in the roadside reeds the women become younger; browner, bolder, barer. Some sit, most fiddle with mobile phones. Two black girls dance for us, one clothed only from beneath her breasts to above her buttocks.<br />
*<br />
A house in the country<br />
I wonder if the dog tied up in my neighbour’s yard – who barks at postmen, strangers, cats, who rummages among the rubbish and comes up with mud on his nose – if he actually knows that the (mercifully lengthy) chain by which he is tied is a device of my neighbour, the dog’s adored owner and master, and not some essential part of his doggy condition.<br />
*<br />
Gabrielle’s story<br />
The hotel’s oldest client insisted on having porridge every morning, something to do with Scots ancestry. He drove her out in the New Jersey evenings, in a car so old it made her laugh. They drank cocktails along the coast in hotels that don’t exist anymore, with big sofas and fading upholstery under pillared verandas with cracked paint. She was bored at the time, but now realizes how beautiful it all was.<br />
*<br />
The end<br />
The nurses’ aides leave my pyjamas perched on the side of the laundry basket, soiled side up, in accusation and evidence. Only the aides and cleaners frequent the bathroom. I decide the aides are trained to behave thus, so that their client will change his ways or that others may chastise him. I can no longer do much about how my bowels behave, so I ignore it. I am finished dealing with things.<br />
*<br />
The sleepwalker<br />
Wanderer, there is no road<br />
Only wakes upon the sea.<br />
&#8211; A. Machado</p>
<p>In early adolescence, Gabrielle walked in her sleep for a while. Later on, she sleepwalked all the time, in a different way. She sleepwalked through university, travel, early jobs, marriage, several houses, several countries, several children. When she finally woke up, she was in a cemetery in Collioure looking at Machado’s grave.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each of us bridesmaids hated the others. We milled around the bride, pinning flowers in her hair. We pulled other flowers out to put ours in. The maid of honor was the bride’s sister, but she was the most useless of them all; she looked out the window at the sky we were missing. Earlier, the groomsmen had held doors open for us, served us patient, patronizing smiles while we stepped on their toes to gather our things. As soon as we left we heard them laughing. Everything must be perfect, the bride said. She was crying. What a show you’re putting on, said the sister. You don’t even believe in it anymore. What does it mean, this show of a promise? This deflated tradition?</p>
<p>We thought about this. The bride cried harder.</p>
<p>But then we’d spent too long thinking, the daytime moon sliding magnetic tentacles around our hearts so we all beat in sync, listening to each other, waiting for the slightest thump to step out of line. It was the sister who spoke first. I can’t breathe, she said. I can’t move.</p>
<p>We blinked. The moon had dragged night around us. We’d all missed the wedding. All we could do was fall over on each other and lay like dolls against the wall. My cheek was mashed against the sister’s mouth. She breathed hot into my ear. Why do you all hate me so much? she asked, I’m down here with the rest of you. She blinked her eyelashes against my forehead.</p>
<p>None of us can move. We are all facing the ceiling so we can’t see the door. We hear sounds of the wedding reception continuing anyways. Finally, I see in the window the reflection out the door. There’s a whole ballroom out there, way more than the bride could afford. The groom is taking the first dance with a floor-length mirror in his arms, but the mirror cuts him at the edges. He looks perfect, we all agree. The bride’s make-up has run completely down her face, and out of the corner of our eyes, we see she was never the bride, she was always the wolf, the one who eats everything we can give until we are consumed, the one we tell, How big your eyes are, clear as emeralds, How beautiful your mouth, glistening like rubies, Your teeth sharp as diamonds. If we could skin the wolf and wear her pelt we would.</p>
<p>But the night is cold, so we press our dresses up to her for warmth. We can move our arms now, but not much more. The sister curls her hand around a fragment of mirror, blade thin as a knife. It hurts to hold, she whispers to me. She brandishes the knife towards the wolf’s stomach. She’s going to dig her sister out.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The star appeared in the sky off Orion’s leg. Bright, insistent, plaintive—a few billion miles west of his knee. Newborn, you could almost hear it crying out.</p>
<p>Rachel Anne lay on her back on the blue and white lounge chair in the heavy warmth of the Victoria night. Her long, pale body was barely contained by the chair’s length. A tattoo of an orange fox wrapped around her ribcage. She wore a bra and jeans. Her toes, high in the air above the frayed cuffs, wiggled slightly at each hint of breeze. Her features were drawn up toward the sky as she stared at the new light.</p>
<p>Trucks moaned on the distant freeway. Out across the desert all was still. Her fingers gripped the coffee-ring-stained plastic arms. The black form of Hunt Mesa loomed on the horizon like an animal that had long ago gone to sleep. She strained her ears, listening for the star’s sound.</p>
<p>Just before dawn, it came to her: a single, desperate note.</p>
<p>Her husband shuffled onto the porch. Bleary-eyed, he looked across the barren expanse of the yard stretching seamlessly into the flat plate of the desert. The chair and his wife in its center. Her pale skin glowing and unreal, as if she had been lowered there, suspended by two silver threads from a starship, before the threads disappeared and the ship flashed away.</p>
<p>Hungry. The word appeared like a struck bell in her mind. The star was hungry.</p>
<p>Her husband made breakfast. Egg whites and peppers sizzling in a cast-iron pan. Carefully, he served them onto two plastic plates. She sat at the table looking down at her hands.<br />
He ate. He touched her cheek and then he went to work, his old sedan coughing down the driveway.</p>
<p>Rachel composed letters to Australia’s leading astronomers. At the research stations in Parkes, Coonabarabran, and Narrabri, the compact array, CSIRO. In the letters, she described herself as a single mother from Adelaide, an amateur physicist, a lover of the cosmos, a waitress.</p>
<p>She sent a copy to the <em>Journal of Interstellar Phenomena</em>, hoping they’d see a human interest angle in her story. A generation of caravan-park girls gazing up into the night.</p>
<p>The young star burned hotter, sending off focused jets of gas and radiant light for trillions of miles. Planets formed in the orbiting mass of dust. Some of them were blasted from the sky before they even had the chance to harden.</p>
<p>As the December nights grew more humid, she took to leaving her clothes, piece by piece, on the creosote. Lifting her shirt over her head and letting it trail from her finger before falling amid the cacti and fire ants as she walked to the chair. Kicking out of her jeans—the smell of onion grease saturated in the denim.</p>
<p>The star’s light was milky on her skin. It spread across her thighs. She arched her back, tilting her hips right and left, rolling up on her spine, turning over completely so the light could touch her everywhere. She was revealed. Translucent. The pulsing valves and empty chambers beneath her surface.</p>
<p>Her husband watched from the bathroom window, his heart pounding.</p>
<p>“I’m pregnant,” she said, as he straightened the insurance policies stacked inside his briefcase.</p>
<p>The morning sun divided his forehead. He smoothed down his thinning hair.</p>
<p>“Rachel,” he said, his face haggard in the small hallway between the kitchen and the front door. “Please.”</p>
<p>It was true, something was growing inside her. She refused to go to work. She wrote more letters—to the hosts of daytime talk shows, members of parliament, an ex-lover who was now a professor of anthropology at Christchurch University. A newborn star, she told them. West of Orion’s knee.</p>
<p>She checked the mailbox every day for a response.</p>
<p>Flyers for a tennis club, an art walk, a mattress sale. Bills. An international letter from her mother.</p>
<p>Rachel’s blood was still in the pipes somewhere. It had joined the other embryos and life tailings in the steel veins of the city.</p>
<p>She slept most of the day. She lost weight, believing the star would sustain her. Styrofoam takeout containers accumulated in the refrigerator. She only opened the door to put her head inside. Feel the cold. The light. She was in a state of rapture. Even in daylight she could see the tendrils of her star stretching through space. Never slowing, never wavering, until they found her here on this arid patch of earth, standing beside a sun-bleached plastic slide, her hand on the warm plastic, the empty clothesline humming in the breeze.</p>
<p>The creature was born fully-formed. Using its powerful pincers, it pulled itself from between her legs and raised its head. Obsidian skin stretched across its horned carapace, incandescent violet at the edges. It raised a double-jointed limb. It opened its mouth so the slender, waving barbels could taste the air.</p>
<p>She held out her hand, wanting to touch the slick exoskeleton. Exhausted, empty. Wondering if she would ever be able to love again.</p>
<p>It hardly looked at her. Taking its first, tentative steps, it struggled from the pool of fluid on the chair, tumbled off the end, and scurried into the desert. Its six legs quickening into rhythm.</p>
<p>“Won’t it ever be enough?” her husband asked, when she padded into the kitchen, her face wet with tears. She passed by him wordlessly. Her bare feet on the cool linoleum, her fingers clasped over her stomach.</p>
<p>A trillion stars in a trillion skies, but that one had been hers.</p>
