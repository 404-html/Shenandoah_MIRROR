								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>After the train wreck of broken-prose confessionalism, there seems to be a general heightened emphasis upon technique, an understanding that, for the best poets, technique is coextensive with feeling, and that many of the elements associated with traditional technique must be mastered if poetry is to remain a serious art.</em><br />
—Christian Wiman</p>
<p><em>…“confessional” or “post-confessional”? Are those pejorative terms? Has there ever been an African-American poet who has been called “confessional” or even half- confessional? What about some of Etheridge Knight’s poems that seem covered in guts? (I realize the terms “confessional” or “post-confessional” are muddied and mean different things to different people, but they still get bandied about, so must be reckoned with.) I wonder if these terms get applied more to women than men.</em><br />

<p><em>Poets put their business out in the street.</em><br />
—Tom Bouman</p>
<p>In 1959, M. L. Rosenthal wrote a review of Robert Lowell’s <em>Life Studies</em> entitled “Poetry as Confession.” Rosenthal’s review popularized the usage of the term “confessional,” a label that eventually attached to Robert Lowell, Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton, John Berryman, and W.D. Snodgrass. These poets came to be known as the confessional poets; additional mid-twentieth century poets also spoken of as confessional poets include Randall Jarrell, Delmore Schwartz, Elizabeth Bishop, Theodore Roethke, Allen Ginsberg, and many more. As Deborah Nelson remarks in her essay, “Confessional Poetry,” a “confessional movement” never existed as an organized school of poetry. Nelson notes: “no confessional poet imagined himself or herself to be part of a movement. The poets never congregated as the confessional poets; they almost universally disliked the term as it applied to their work.” However, the confessional mode became a defining influence on the development of American lyric narrative poetry from the early 1960’s into the second decade of the twenty-first century.</p>
<p>From the time of its coinage to present day, the term “confessional,” as applied to poetry, has proven problematic. Rosenthal’s initial formulation of the confessional mode of writing posits confessional poetry as a kind of “soul’s therapy.” <em>Life Studies</em>, as confessionalism’s inaugural book, provides an unflinching look at the poet’s family history, his psychological problems as an adult, his feelings of contempt for his father, and his thoughts on the dissolution of his first marriage. Like the hermit heiress in “Skunk Hour,” Lowell’s poems are not “thirsting for/ the hierarchic privacy/ of Queen Victoria’s century.” Instead, the private must be made public. This breakdown of privacy opens up the poems to admissions as shameful as when the speaker describes watching teenagers making out in parked cars and declares: “My mind is not right.” The confession of voyeurism in “Skunk Hour” invites the voyeurism of the reader; confession elicits complicity that, in turn, causes the reader to question the truth of the story being told. Whether Lowell is the speaker of this poem or not, the source of this poem’s inspiration clearly follows from shame and guilt.</p>
<p>In much high Modernist, and in most romantic poetry, the sources of inspiration for a poem (the psychic wound, the secret trauma, whatever guilt or shame or bliss drove a poet to write) remained at least partially hidden; in <em>Life Studies</em>, the source became the poem and nothing remained hermetic or impersonal. As Rosenthal puts it: “Lowell removes the mask. His speaker is unequivocally himself, and it is hard not to think of <em>Life Studies</em> as a series of personal confidences, rather shameful, that one is honor bound not to reveal.” This reading downplays the sophistication of Lowell’s work, homogenizes the several narrative voices in <em>Life Studies</em>, and offers far too credulous an assessment of the poems themselves. The critic equates the disclosure of personal, sometimes unflattering, details with truth. The authority of the speaker endures unquestioned. Rosenthal’s description of the confessional mode burdens the revelatory function of Lowell’s poems with blurred notions of shame and authenticity.</p>
<p>Confessional poetry since Rosenthal’s appraisal of <em>Life Studies</em>, although variously defined, remains contingent upon the linkages between personal revelation, private guilt, and public authenticity. Adam Kirsch explains that the generally accepted narrative about the confessional movement runs as follows:</p>
<p>Before<em> Life Studies,</em> the standard account has it, poets of Lowell’s generation were strapped in a corset of critical orthodoxy; after its revelations of mental illness and family trauma, they could breathe freely. Confessional poetry, as it came to be known, learned from Lowell that Modernist allusions and ambiguities are less important than simple, searing honesty.</p>
<p><em>Life Studies,</em> as Kirsch also notes, followed Delmore Schwartz’s <em>Genesis</em> and John Berryman’s “Sonnets to Chris,” both written in the 1940s. Lowell, therefore, did not pioneer a direct autobiographical approach that opposed the reigning orthodoxies of New Criticism and Modernism. Nevertheless, as Deborah Nelson claims, the enduring influence of Lowell’s book has overturned those reigning orthodoxies, making an autobiographical, or “confessional,” reading of T.S. Eliot’s or Ezra Pound’s poetry a commonplace for “post-confessional” readers.</p>
<p>Forthright personal revelation distinguishes confessional poetry from Modernism. Deborah Nelson explains:</p>
<p>Eliot’s famous declaration of the impersonality of the poet, along with William Carlos Williams’s dictum, “no idea but in things,” put the psyche of the poet firmly out of view, irrelevant to the poetic project. This theory of impersonality was taken up and elaborated not only by the generation of poets that followed them, but also by the most important critics of the day, the so-called New Critics.</p>
<p>Lowell and his “confessional” contemporaries eschewed the aesthetic theories and practices of their predecessors. Although all of the confessional poets, particularly Berryman and Plath, continued to deploy the Modernist techniques of collage, allusion, and disjointed narrative, they privileged the personal and autobiographical; the impersonal stance could no longer hold. Moreover, writing in the immediate shadow of the Modernists’ achievements produced anxiety in the poets who followed them. Pound, Eliot, Williams, H.D., and Gertrude Stein had produced poetry on a grand historical, mythical, and cultural scale. The confessional poets redirected the historical, mythical, and cultural imperatives manifest in the most ambitious works of Modernist poetry. For example, Pound’s impulse toward the epic in <em>The Cantos</em> was reconfigured in Berryman’s <em>The Dream Songs</em>. Of Pound’s influence, Berryman said: “It is no good looking for models. We want anti-models.”</p>
<p><em>The Dream Songs</em>, despite their fragmentary and dissociative kinship with <em>The Cantos</em>, cohere in an evocation of grief. Berryman’s father committed suicide when he was twelve. Even though the character of Henry, who narrates <em>The Dream Songs</em>, obscures the autobiographical sense of the poems, William Meredith reported that Berryman claimed the poems chronicled his reactions to the death of his father. Lewis Hyde, in his essay “Alcohol and Poetry: John Berryman and the Booze Talking,” makes a convincing case that <em>The Dream Songs</em> also function as a record of the war between the poet’s alcoholism and his creative energies. Hyde asserts that in this cycle of poems, Berryman dramatizes his struggle with addiction:</p>
<p>…<em>The Dream Songs</em> can be explicated in terms of the disease of alcoholism. We can hear the booze talking. Its moods are anxiety, guilt and fear. Its tone is a moan that doesn’t revolve. Its themes are unjust pain, resentment, and a desperate desire to run the world. It has a con-man’s style and the con-game’s plot. It depends for its survival on an arrogance of will, ascendant and dissociated from the whole. These poems are not a contribution to culture. They are artifacts of a dying civilization, like one of those loaves of bread turned to lava at Pompeii.</p>
<p>Berryman stands as an outlier among the confessional poets because his creative work sublimates his spiritual pain and his alcoholism. Nonetheless, strands of confessional detail writhe to the surface of his poems despite their idiosyncratic diction and jarred syntax. The most blatant example of these details occurs in the 76th Dream Song: “—If life is a handkerchief sandwich,/ in a modesty of death I join my father/ who dared so long agone leave me.” These lines acknowledge the pain and loss that much of Berryman’s other poems attempt to deny. It was, perhaps, this lifelong suffering that resulted in the poet’s suicide in 1972 when he threw himself off a bridge in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>Just as Berryman’s personal demons dictated the form and content of his poetry, individual anguishes and woes determined the course of the work done by Lowell, Plath, Snodgrass, and Sexton. Sexton and Plath also committed suicide. Lowell and Snodgrass married and divorced multiple women. With the exception of Snodgrass, all of these poets dealt with, and wrote about, mental illness. All of these poets were white, and middle- or upper-class, but the subject matter of their poems transgressed the norms of white, middle-class, heterosexual society. As Deborah Nelson recounts: “Sexton, Lowell, Plath, Berryman, and Snodgrass made poems about marital failure and infidelity, (hetero) sexual transgression, abortion, rage, mental illness, and drug and alcohol abuse.” The rawness of their poetry and their bravery in addressing subjects that were taboo during the 1950s and 1960s distinguished these poets from their contemporaries and linked them together.</p>
<p>Anne Sexton’s body of work exemplifies the bravery and the rawness of the confessional poets. The impact of her work on subsequent generations of poets also embodies the lasting influence of the confessional mode. Sexton wrote poems about intimate, and, in her day, unmentionable topics such as menstruation, abortion, and aggressive female sexual desire. Her best poems were complex and distinctive, but accessible. She also wrote persona poems and poems, such as “Snow White and the Seven Dwarves” and “Rapunzel,” that re-envisioned classic fairytales. Sexton described herself as “an actress in my own autobiographical plays.”</p>
<p>In a <em>Paris Review</em> interview, she related the reasons for her late start as a poet:</p>
<p>Until I was twenty-eight I had a kind of buried self who didn’t know she could do anything but make white sauce and diaper babies. I didn’t know I had any creative depths. I was a victim of the American Dream, the bourgeois, middle-class dream. All I wanted was a little piece of life, to be married, to have children. I thought the nightmares, the visions, the demons would go away if there was enough love to put them down. I was trying my damnedest to lead a conventional life, for that was how I was brought up, and it was what my husband wanted of me. But one can’t build little white picket fences to keep nightmares out. The surface cracked when I was about twenty-eight. I had a psychotic break and tried to kill myself.<br />
.<br />
Sexton’s psychiatrist encouraged her to write poetry and she used it, in lieu of a white picket fence, to keep the nightmares out. Her acceptance of poetry implied a rejection of the types of middle-class conformity that had created her air-conditioned hell.</p>
<p>Sexton’s poetry typifies the confessional reaction both to Modernist poetry and to the society in which she wrote. As Edward Hirsch points out, the confessional poets, reacting to New Criticism and to Modernism, brought “a messy humanity, a harsh luminosity, a well of tenderness back into poetry.” Hirsch continues: “To do so they had to walk out from under the living shadows, the Jamesian greatcoats, the smothering grandiloquence. They are like Yeats at the turn of the century. Everyone got down off their stilts. They found more enterprise in walking naked.” “Walking naked,” radical self-exposure, became the cornerstone of Sexton’s poetry. Even when Sexton wrote dramatic monologues, or persona poems, she did so in order to explore deeply the contours of her self-hood. For Sexton, poetry “milks the unconscious.” The symbols and images in a poem derive from the intimate details of the writer’s life and might contain a therapeutic energy helpful to both the poet and the reader. Oftentimes for Sexton, these symbols, images, details, and energies entail a social critique of gender roles, as in the poem, “Housewife,” which begins “Some women marry houses./ It’s another kind of skin; it has a heart,/ a mouth, a liver, and bowel movements.” These lines of poetry, drawn closely from Sexton’s personal experience as a housewife, provide an excoriating criticism of a domesticity that results in control over a woman’s body. Marriage becomes a means for incarnating subordination; this system of containment is ultimately excremental.</p>
<p>Making broad, but pointed, social critiques through the use of personal experiences characterized the best aspects of confessional poetry. Sexton’s poem, “Young,” offers another example:</p>
<p>A thousand doors ago<br />
when I was a lonely kid<br />
in a big house with four<br />
garages and it was summer<br />
as long as I could remember,<br />
I lay on the lawn at night,<br />
clover wrinkling over me,<br />
the wise stars bedding over me,<br />
my mother&#8217;s window a funnel<br />
of yellow heat running out,<br />
my father&#8217;s window, half shut,<br />
an eye where sleepers pass,<br />
and the boards of the house<br />
were smooth and white as wax<br />
and probably a million leaves<br />
sailed on their strange stalks<br />
as the crickets ticked together<br />
and I, in my brand new body,<br />
which was not a woman&#8217;s yet,<br />
told the stars my questions<br />
and thought God could really see<br />
the heat and the painted light,<br />
elbows, knees, dreams, goodnight.</p>
<p>Here Sexton condenses a memory in exquisite detail and obliquely questions, not only God, but the whole world of her childhood. Without bludgeoning the reader, Sexton exposes a portrait of a troubled home. The father and mother sleep in separate rooms. The father’s window stays half shut. The girl, lonely and inquisitive, lies on the lawn outside of the home. The speaker in the poem is in control of her “brand new body.” Lying on the lawn, looking up at the sky, she ponders the minute ordering of experience: “wise stars” beyond reach, the cricket song and the white boards of the house covering the difficult truths of family life. Childhood, for the speaker, happened “a thousand doors ago.” The work of the poet demands each of those doors be opened.</p>
<p>The figure of the girl in this poem represents the speaker in all confessional poetry; her outsider status interrogates the type of conformity that leads some women to “marry houses.”</p>
<p>Poems like Sexton’s “Young” and “Housewife” epitomize the strategies used by the confessional poets. These strategies involved uncovering what was hidden, talking about the taboo, and translating the personal, and sometimes minor, experiences of a lifetime into a poetry that was as universal and durable as the poetry of the Modernists. Confessional poetry opened up the form and the content of poetry. As Robert Lowell put it:</p>
<p>Poets of my generation and particularly younger ones have gotten terribly proficient at these forms. They write a very musical, difficult poem with tremendous skill, perhaps there’s never been such skill. Yet the writing seems divorced from culture somehow. It’s become too much something specialized that can’t handle much experience. It’s become a craft, purely a craft, and there must be some breakthrough back into life.</p>
<p>Lowell’s assessment of his contemporaries seems even more apropos of the poetry written in the first two decades of the twenty-first century. The confessional poets gave poets of subsequent generations permission to write about anything; no subject was off limits. Simultaneously, the feeling of belatedness related to writing in the shadow of the Modernists could be mitigated. The flood of poems written in the confessional mode in the second half of the twentieth century, however, created new problems for poets. To understand the problems posed by writing in the confessional mode today, confessional poetry must be placed within its historical context.</p>
<p>Confessional poetry comes to prominence along with the Beat Generation and the New York School at the height of the Cold War. The civil rights movement, the counter-culture, the feminist movement, and the gay rights movement signaled fundamental changes in American society. In these movements, speaking personally became a crucial form of intervention in the public sphere and an overt political act. Individual, rather than communal, belief propelled these movements forward. The confession of personal experience became a vehicle for social and political agency. As Deborah Nelson explains:<br />
Confession, with or without the motivation of Penance or psychic pain relief, also represents one of the most varied forms of artistic experimentation in the latter half of the twentieth century. It is impossible to imagine this period without considering the popularity of the memoir and the autobiographical novel, the exhibitionism of performance art, the subjective viewpoint of the New Journalism, and the self-portraiture in photography and the fine arts generally, to say nothing of the personal revelations of talk shows, tabloids, and, in the twenty-first century, personal blogs and social media.</p>
<p>In the world of reality television, Twitter, Facebook, and Tumblr, the boundaries of the personal and the private have blurred. The forms of confession practiced in contemporary social media are staged and superficial, contingent upon spectacle, less concerned with discovering truths than they are with generating celebrity. Shocking confessions may abound in social media today, but little retains the power to shock or to foment meaningful political change.</p>
<p>Formal control and understanding of the tradition has always been weak among mediocre poets, but the slackening of these in the 1980s and 1990s resulted in a kind of one-upmanship among poets vying to tell the most traumatic secret. Sensationalism and identity politics dominated the worst poetry published during this time period. Movements, such as L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Poetry, developed, or strengthened, in reaction to the perceived inadequacy of poetry written in the confessional mode. At the same time, the proliferation of MFA programs and Creative Writing departments produced a glut of what Robert Lowell would have called &#8220;terribly proficient&#8221; craftsmen. Furthermore, many of these terribly proficient craftsmen in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century began to distrust narrative. As Carolyn Forché famously observed: “Our age lacks the structure of a story. Or perhaps it would be closer to say that narrative implies progress and completion. The history of our time does not allow for any of the bromides of progress, nor for the promise of successful closure.” The best poets of this time period disregard this pronouncement and continue to write lyric narrative poetry of surpassing power.</p>
<p>Tony Hoagland further unpacks the problem with narrative that poets such as Joe Weil, Ruth Stone, Sharon Olds, Maria Mazziotti Gillan, and Denise Duhamel circumvent in their poetry. In his essay, “Fear of Narrative and the Skittery Poem of Our Moment,” Hoagland specifies:</p>
<p>What aspect of narrative is so to be guarded against? A number of familiar explanations present themselves. To start with, it seems likely that narrative poetry in America has been tainted by its over-use in thousands of confessional poems. Not confessionalism itself, but the inadvertent sentimentality and narcissism of many such poems have imparted the odor of indulgence to narrative. Our vision of narrative possibilities has been narrowed by so many first person autobiographical stories, then drowned in a flood of pathos poems. Psychology itself, probably the most widely-shared narrative of the last several generations of American culture, has lost its charisma as a system, if not its currency. Secondly, many persons think that ours is simply not a narrative age; that contemporary experience is too multitracked, too visual, too manifold and simultaneous to be confined to the linearity of narrative, no matter how well done.</p>
<p>Great poets have always risked sentimentality to expose true sentiment. If the current age lacks a structure and is “too multitracked, too visual, too manifold,” then perhaps the first person narrative still retains the power to provide a momentary stay against confusion. Hoagland’s assessment implies that poetry reflects experience, but, as Rainer Maria Rilke has eloquently argued, poems are experiences in and of themselves; they are not merely reflections. No matter how many first person autobiographical stories are published a single great poem cannot be “drowned in a flood of pathos poems.”</p>
<p>Another problem confronting contemporary lyric narrative poets and their confessional forbearers is the autobiographical “I.” Poets such as Olds, Duhamel, Gillan, Weil, and Stone write poetry that is predominantly inspired by direct lived experience and is rarely, if ever, transmuted into myth in the manner of Sylvia Plath’s <em>Ariel</em> poems. Yusef Komunyakaa’s explanation of the autobiographical “I” applies to the narrative voice used in the work of these poets. Komunyakaa elaborates:</p>
<p>For me, the speaker is often a universal “I” whose feelings have been shaped by experience and/or imagination, an emphatic witness. Since the human being is an act of becoming, the “I” is cultivated, shaped, and nurtured—from first breath to last. The “I” possesses will: “I am” is an action, and so is the act of writing poetry a sustenance. Like any of the other arts, poetry isn’t a career or a job. Neither is the poet the mere keeper of an emotional logbook, nor a reporter, curator, or documentarist. Although he or she may keep a journal, jotting down the daily mishaps, observations, and blessings, cataloguing glimpses into the past and present, straining to see the future, the poem is still “a made thing.”</p>
<p>Komunyakaa&#8217;s explication of the autobiographical “I” underscores the poet’s faith in the capacity of poetry to express fundamental human desires and predicaments. Writing in the confessional mode does not serve the same ends as the documentarian, the journalist, or the historian. The poet is not merely a curator, but rather a creator of experience. The autobiographical “I,” in Komunyakaa’s formulation, shapes the poet as much as the poet shapes this persona created by the poem’s “I.” This conception of the autobiographical “I” debunks the claims of egocentric narcissism with which much contemporary lyric narrative poetry has been charged by critics such as Christian Wiman.</p>
<p>At the beginning of his tenure as editor of <em>Poetry</em> magazine, Wiman put forth an editorial statement in which he imagined ruthless future readers who “will look at all these poems into which we’ve poured the wounded truths of our hearts, all the fraught splendor and terror of these lives we suffered and sang &#8230; and giggle.” Wiman rejects what he perceives to be an epidemic technical laziness in contemporary poetry, a phenomenon he terms “the train wreck of broken-prose confessionalism.” The complaint about formal facility in lyric narrative poetry appears frequently in criticism of poetry written in the confessional mode. Joan Aleshire echoes Wiman when she claims:</p>
<p>In the confessional poem, as I’d like to define it, the poet, overwhelmed or intoxicated by the facts of his or her life, lets the facts take over. To say that a poem is confessional is to signal a breakdown in judgment and craft. Confession shares with the lyric a degree of self-revelation but carries implications that the lyric resists. <em>The Oxford English Dictionary</em> defines confession as the declaration or disclosure of something that one has allowed to remain secret as being prejudicial, humiliating, or inconvenient to oneself; the disclosure of private feeling; a plea of guilty, an admission of what one has been charged with; a formal confession made in order to receive absolution. I see the confessional poem as a plea for special treatment, a poem where the poet’s stance is one of particularity apart from common experience. Confession in art, as in life, can be self- serving—an attempt to shift the burden of knowledge from speaker-transgressor to listener.</p>
<p>Aleshire’s definition accounts for the negative charge associated with confessional poetry. No poet wants their poems to be viewed as a means for shifting guilt onto a reader. To equate confessional poetry with a breakdown in craft and judgment further stigmatizes the mode. Most damning of all, however, is the view of a confessional poem as “a plea for special treatment.” A poem which exists merely as a linguistic maneuver meant to situate a poet apart from common experience is no poem at all. Aleshire&#8217;s definition, although nuanced and accurate when looking at the work of unexceptional poets, falls short when applied to extraordinary poets writing confessional poetry.</p>
<p>Extraordinary poets such as Joe Weil, Denise Duhamel, Maria Mazziotti Gillan, Ruth Stone, and Sharon Olds all write confessional poetry. None of these poets would claim to be a confessional poet, just as none of the confessional poets, with the exception of Anne Sexton, accepted the label. All of these poets possess great technical proficiency and a profound understanding of the literary tradition in which they write. More importantly, the confessions in the poems written by these poets do not separate the poet from common experience. Shameful admissions in these poets’ works are not “pleas for special treatment.” Rather, by admitting the fragilities, triumphs, and failures of a lifetime, these poets hold forth the promise of reconciliation and communion. During the sacrament of reconciliation in Roman Catholicism the penitent confesses the sins that have caused a separation from the Body of Christ (the church). Sin separates the sinner from grace. Confession restores the sinner to a state of grace. The impulse and function of confessional poetry at its best follows a similar trajectory from solitude to communion, from disjuncture to unity, from disgrace through a recognition of human fallibility to wholeness and a full participation in the shared struggles of communal life.</p>
<p>Such a view of the confessional mode positions the purpose of poetry as one of avowal and renewal. Maria Mazziotti Gillan’s poem, “Daddy, We Called You” clearly shows these motions of avowal and renewal. The poem confesses:</p>
<p>One night, riding home from a date,<br />
my middle class, American boyfriend<br />
kissed me at the light; I looked up<br />
and met your eyes as you stood at the corner<br />
near Royal Machine. It was nearly midnight.<br />
January. Cold and Windy. You were waiting<br />
for the bus, the streetlight illuminating<br />
your face. I pretended I did not see you,<br />
let my boyfriend pull away, leaving you<br />
on the empty corner waiting for the bus<br />
to take you home. You never mentioned it,<br />
never said that you knew<br />
how often I lied about what you did for a living<br />
or that I was ashamed to have my boyfriend see you,<br />
find out about your second shift work, your broken English.</p>
<p>The denial of the father in this poem is a denial of self. By confessing the sin of shame for her father, the poet avows her love for him. There is a directness to Gillan’s poem that admits no posturing. By affirming her love of her father, by admitting the difference that he represented and of which she was ashamed, the poet reconnects the tissue that her denial severed. The autobiographical “I” in this poem is a universal “I,” channeling the experience of anyone who has denied their roots and disregarded their heritage, if only for a moment. Of the universality present in Gillan’s work, Joe Weil has commented: “All griefs are as unprecedented, as original as the whorls in our fingerprints, and yet certain poets are able to take the specific ceremonies of grief and loss and reenact them in such a way that they are meaningful to all who read their work.” As with all the best confessional poems, Gillan’s work bridges the particular with the universal.</p>
<p>Ruth Stone similarly bridged the particular with the universal. Stone’s poems obsessively confront grief and loss in a similar fashion to Maria Mazziotti Gillan’s. Unlike Gillan, who writes in sprawling and direct aria-like lines, many of Stone’s poems compress experience in short lyric snatches. Like John Berryman, who dealt with the death of his father in his work, Stone confronts the specter of her husband’s suicide again and again. The poem, “The Professor Cries” provides a representative example of Stone’s confessional poetry. The poem reads:</p>
<p>This is the end of March.<br />
The tax collector<br />
wants me to cut my wrists.<br />
The roach inspector<br />
drives up in a truck.<br />
The snow sits like dough<br />
turning sour. Every hour<br />
love’s bones grow lighter.<br />
This is what comes<br />
of having no pity.<br />
Time used me.<br />
Death used me.<br />
I live in Johnson City.</p>
<p>This short poem, which is the first poem in Ruth Stone’s <em>In the Next Galaxy,</em> simultaneously evokes the universal and the particular. In the poem, the list of troubles compounds from the inertia of the first line, through the impositions the tax collector and the roach inspector, to the musical fulcrum of the lines: “The snow sits like dough/ turning sour. Every hour/ love’s bones grow lighter.” The list accelerates past “what comes/ of having no pity”: being used by time and death. The poem ends with the arresting line: “I live in Johnson City.” This last line brings the poem to a halt, restores the inertia of the first line, and seems to offer either an explanation for what has come before it in the poem or a defiant statement of enduring that begs the question, “Why Johnson City?”</p>
<p>If you have never sat in the Red Robin Diner on Main Street in Johnson City, New York, or gotten your hair cut at Bill’s Barber Shop on Floral Avenue, the final line does not contain as much weight. Johnson City is a depressed town with a population of around 15, 000 predominantly working class people. The town is known as “The Home of the Square Deal,” a form of welfare capitalism sponsored by the Endicott-Johnson Shoe Factory, which provided workers with cheap homes, parks, parades, and other social programs, in order to ensure a reliable workforce in the early twentieth century. Today, Johnson City’s population has declined, the city has been on the verge of bankruptcy for years, and the local government is notoriously corrupt. The streets are shabby and pothole pocked. In the summer, you often see babies in diapers playing unattended in patches of dirt that used to be green lawns. Pedestrians often spit on the sidewalk in Johnson City. Litter is everywhere. To live in Johnson City is to live in the rundown husk of a town.</p>
<p>The feeling of debasement and sadness that sinks gradually, in tandem with the structure of Stone’s poem, gains resonance with a knowledge of the abandoned public swimming pools and closed factories that punctuate the streets of the town. Living in Johnson City, surrounded by so much ruin, might make “love’s bones grow lighter.” However, the very unremarkable qualities, of urban decay and suburban neglect that make Johnson City typical of many American places, enable the poem to transcend the details of locality that lend the poem added resonance. The Johnson City in Ruth Stone’s poem is and is not the Johnson City where Stone lived while she taught at Binghamton University. Stone’s Johnson City is a universal Johnson City, where the crushing details of living in a small town cannot crush the affirmation at the poem’s end. Ultimately, Stone’s poem is about enduring. The speaker in the poem lives in Johnson City, despite how time and death have used her. She endures and the music of this endurance sings at the poem’s center. Although “the snow sits like dough/ turning sour,” the music of that turning breaks into strong song.</p>
<p>“Place” cradles the confessional details in this poem. The poet admits to living in a backwater. In so doing, she confesses her allegiance to the humble and the ordinary. Her husband’s suicide ghosts through the lines in the image of slit wrists, in the recollection of how love’s bones have grown lighter, and in the ascendancy of time and death. The lines “This is what comes,/ of having no pity” confess a brokenness that has caused callouses to form. Although Ruth Stone was an atheist, “The Professor Cries” enacts what Joe Weil would call a “Eucharistic reality.” Weil explains:</p>
<p>To put it simply: I seek in my poetics the moment when the divine is seen in the other, and the divine is not Jerusalem, the expected place, but Bethlehem, the lowly place, the place unsought, but stumbled upon, the “slip of the pen”–that is a moment of Eucharistic reality–grace.</p>
<p>Confessional poems manifest a Eucharistic sense of the world (that this body, the word, is both broken and blessed, and therefore meant for communion). In this respect, both Ruth Stone’s and Maria Mazziotti Gillan’s poems are confessional. Simply put, confession restores grace.</p>
<p>Joe Weil’s poetry bears out this definition of the confessional. In Weil’s best poems, personal stories are braided into a dense web of literary, mythical, and historical allusions. Weil is more of a trickster in his poems than either Stone or Gillan. There is a playfulness and humor in his poems that turns brokenness into a blessing. His poem, “Fists” provides a good example of Weil’s commitment to poetry as unifying praise. The poem reads as follows:</p>
<p>It was the sense that your fists were worlds<br />
and mine were not that caused me to worship you;<br />
all those thick rope veins, and the deep inlaid grime of your life,<br />
the permanent filth of your labors.</p>
<p>I wanted your history.<br />
My own smoothness appalled me.<br />
I wanted that hardness<br />
of fists.<br />
I&#8217;d pry your fingers loose,<br />
using both my hands,<br />
find stones, a robin&#8217;s egg uncrushed<br />
in the thick meat of your palms.<br />
Between thumb and forefinger,<br />
your flesh smelled of creosote and lye,<br />
three packs of Chesterfield Kings.<br />
You told me stories about heroes,<br />
David with his sling,<br />
Samson with his jaw bone of an ass,<br />
Christ with his word forgive.</p>
<p>Tonight, I read about Cuchulain<br />
contending with the sea,<br />
how he killed his son in battle,<br />
a son he&#8217;d never known,<br />
and, mad with his grief,<br />
fought the waves<br />
for three nights and as many days,<br />
until, at last, he came ashore,<br />
and fell asleep holding his dead child&#8217;s hands.<br />
When he woke, it was morning, and the hands of his son<br />
had become two black swans.<br />
They flew west where all suffering ends.<br />
I read this story<br />
and I remember you.<br />
Hold me clenched until I am those birds.<br />
Sleep now,<br />
until your fists can open.</p>
<p>The poem begins with a profession of admiration for the poet’s father, whose fists were worlds inlaid with the grime of a life. The second stanza shifts to the confessional mode when the poet admits: “I wanted your history./ My own smoothness appalled me./ I wanted that hardness/ of fists.” The act of confession initiates the memory of prying loose a robin’s egg held in the father’s hands. This memory restores a unity between father and son. The image of the father’s powerful creosote and lye caked hand cradling the delicate egg is one of reunification and safety.</p>
<p>Once this unity has been established, Weil’s poem invokes the communal force of storytelling. The poet remembers his father telling the stories of David with his sling, Samson with his jawbone, and, most notably, Christ with his word forgive. The progression of these stories is significant. David the poet-warrior-king, precedes the Nazarite hero who slew Philistines, who in turn precede Jesus offering mercy and forgiveness. Forgiveness and reconciliation are at the heart of this poem and praise. The difficulties between father and son mend and pivot on the word forgive. After Christ, the poem moves, in its final stanza to Cuchulain, the Irish mythological hero from the Ulster Cycle. Cuchulain kills his son in battle, but his son’s hands turn into black swans and fly west where all suffering ends. Grief leads Cuchulain to battle the waves of the sea, and this battle ends in transformation. Similarly, the grief and nostalgia that tinge the opening of Weil’s poem are transformed into praise. The final image complicates the narrative as Weil apostrophizes: “Hold me clenched until I am those birds./ Sleep now,/ until your fists can open.” Weil ends the poem with a further confession, that he is not those birds who have flown beyond all suffering. Rather, he is a man like any other man, fragile as a robin’s egg. The strength of his dead father carries him still. The delicate injunction “sleep now,” conveys the poet’s belief in love, forgiveness, and the promise of wholeness.</p>
<p>The Eucharistic reality that inhabits Weil’s poetry, and invests it with the potential to restore grace applies equally to poems whose subject matter is decidedly more secular. Sharon Olds’ “Poem of Thanks” reflects on a failed marriage in a similar fashion. The poem reads:</p>
<p>Years later, long single,<br />
I want to turn to his departed back,<br />
and say, What gifts we had of each other!<br />
What pleasure &#8211; confiding, open-eyed,<br />
fainting with what we were allowed to stay up<br />
late doing. And you couldn&#8217;t say,<br />
could you, that the touch you had from me<br />
was other than the touch of one<br />
who could love for life &#8211; whether we were suited<br />
or not &#8211; for life, like a sentence. And now that I<br />
consider, the touch that I had from you<br />
became not the touch of the long view, but like the<br />
tolerant willingness of one<br />
who is passing through. Colleague of sand<br />
by moonlight &#8211; and by beach noonlight, once,<br />
and of straw, salt bale in a barn, and mulch<br />
inside a garden, between the rows &#8211; once-<br />
partner of up against the wall in that tiny<br />
bathroom with the lock that fluttered like a chrome<br />
butterfly beside us, hip-height, the familiar<br />
of our innocence, which was the ignorance<br />
of what would be asked, what was required,<br />
thank you for every hour. And I<br />
accept your thanks, as if it were<br />
a gift of yours, to give them &#8211; let&#8217;s part<br />
equals, as we were in every bed, pure<br />
equals of the earth.</p>
<p>The confession in this poem is not that the marriage failed, but that in the failed marriage there was sweetness that remained unremarked. The remembrance of an equalizing sexual pleasure affords the grounds for the confession that even in failure lingers room for thanks. To be “pure equals of the earth” and “colleagues of sand by moonlight” affirms a Eucharistic sense of the holiness that courses through ruin.</p>
<p>“Poem of Thanks” inverts the confessional poem practiced throughout Olds’ body of work. Olds’ poems often detail sex and domestic strife in the candid manner of Anne Sexton’s poems. In an interview published in <em>The Rumpus</em> Denise Duhamel discussed Olds, the confessional mode, and the legacy of the Confessional Poets. Duhamel said:</p>
<p>If you are my friend and say to me, “Please don’t write about this,” I won’t. I don’t think I could have agreed to that twenty years ago and would have been only able to say, “I’ll try my best not to!” I remember going to a poetry panel in the mid-1990s, and someone asked if Sharon Olds might be part of a cultural nexus that included talk shows like those hosted by Phil Donahue and Oprah. The audience just sort of giggled and the panel didn’t address the question, but I do think there is something to that notion. Not that Olds herself watched such shows—I have no idea if she did or not. But the question asked by the audience member suggested that there was something in the zeitgeist that allowed for and accommodated disclosure.</p>
<p>My students rarely wrote about personal topics when I first started teaching, but now they are more forthcoming with seemingly personal details. There is less embarrassment around certain issues. We have come far from the days of the first confessional poets. In 1959, M.L. Rosenthal actually referred to Lowell’s <em>Life Studies</em>  “as a series of personal confidences, rather shameful, that one is honor-bound not to reveal.” I can’t imagine any reviewer writing that about a book of poems today, although I suppose TMI has made it into our lexicon for a reason. Reality TV takes this notion even further. Viewers follow “real” people, not only when they are in crisis or giving birth, but also as they do the most mundane things.</p>
<p>The zeitgeist of the age unmistakably allows for and accommodates disclosure. Lowell and his contemporaries held such influence because the zeitgeist of their age ran counter to disclosure; their disclosures gained in urgency because they expressed subjects and experience that were largely absent from the public discourse. Today, everything is discussed, but the discussion creates a cacophony, a clutter of exposés and admissions, a clamoring for attention that becomes more and more distracted. Scandal and outrage break through the clutter momentarily and vanish into dissonance just as quickly as they emerge. The disclosures that occur on a talk show, in tabloids, in the news, and in social media, occupy a different space than those that occur in a poem. The act of reading, even an accessible and direct poem, requires a sustained concentration missing from the viewers of a reality television show or the subscribers to a Twitter feed.</p>
<p>Denise Duhamel’s poetry consists primarily of revelations that would make her a hit on a reality television show. The disclosure of intimate personal details that would be sensationalized on the internet or in a television show lend her poems tremendous emotional power. Duhamel’s poem “You Don’t Get to Tell Me What to Do Ever Again” furnishes what M.L. Rosenthal would have called “a series of personal confidences, rather shameful, that one is honor-bound not to reveal.” A television producer might call these confidences ratings gold, but in the poem, the aggregate weight of these confidences leads from confession through a recognition of human fallibility to wholeness and a full participation in the shared struggles of communal life. The poem begins:</p>
<p>There was a time all my husband wanted was sex.<br />
I was premenstrual, too tired,<br />
in a bitch of a mood, then premenopausal,<br />
or maybe even bored.<br />
He would lie beside me jerking off<br />
while I pretended to sleep.</p>
<p>This beginning works within the established conventions of confessional poetry; the confessions here are less shocking in 2013 than Anne Sexton’s menstruation poems were in the 1960s. The opening lines establish another conventional subject in confessional poetry, an unhappy marriage. After these lines Duhamel alludes to the film <em>American Beauty</em>. Duhamel takes the poem’s title from a line in the film and dedicates it to the film’s main character, Lester Burnham. The poet nuances the poem by placing its confessional aspects in dialogue with a popular film that critiques American materialism and suburban conformity.<br />
The poem continues to describe the usual details found in poems about marital problems: miscommunication, suspicion, and the eventual dissolution of the marriage. The second half of the poem reads:</p>
<p>The year before he left<br />
we avoided being awake in bed<br />
at the same time and, when we were,<br />
we lay on our backs hoping the other would take over.<br />
One night I turned on my side, facing the wall,<br />
remembering the way we used to kiss, the eager way<br />
all lovers kiss at first, then the way the kisses fizzle<br />
and shorten to a peck.<br />
I took a deep breath, tried<br />
to formulate something loving or seductive to say,<br />
but instead snapped, Will you please stop that!<br />
and my husband’s secret was out. He left the bed<br />
for the bathroom and the recliner<br />
and eventually for another woman in another state,<br />
which leads me to today. Now that it’s too late,<br />
all I want is sex. I am the one jerking off<br />
as the hands of my imagined and real lovers,<br />
dead or gone, reach down from the ceiling<br />
sprinkling me with rose petals, red American Beauty mouths<br />
that whisper there’s no way to domesticate you, darling,<br />
and I pretend I can do whatever I want.</p>
<p>In Duhamel’s poem, the series of personal confidences build to the true confession: it is too late. Fundamentally, this poem seeks to confront mortality. The speaker can pretend to do what she wants, but she cannot undo the damage of haste and time. She cannot, despite her assertions of independence and strength, stave off regret and loss. By admitting the knowledge of powerlessness in the face of loss Duhamel manifests a Eucharistic sense of the world; broken and blessed, this sense leads to communion.</p>
<p>Poetry is earned communion. Confession is the most potent means for achieving such communion. Communion consists of the stories that we tell each other. All utterance falls short. The vast blank expanse of the page offers a space to move through the unsayable. Annie Dillard said: “Spend it all, shoot it, play it, lose it, all, right away, every time. Do not hoard what seems good for a later place. Assume you write for an audience consisting of terminal patients. That is, after all, the case. What could you say to a dying person that would not enrage by its triviality?” The best poetry says what is necessary and nothing more; its only reason for being is to help us survive. Critics and academics construct schools of poetry and modes of writing. Poetry is not, and never has been, monolithic, but the division of poetry into competing factions is a fabrication and a lie. There is good poetry and bad poetry, poetry that will endure and poetry that will sink into oblivion.</p>
<p>The best lyric narrative poets writing today say what is most urgent. They put their business in the street. They are unashamed to praise. They are unashamed to confess their faults and mourn their losses. As Anne Sexton said, “there are little deaths in life, too—in your own life—and at that point, sometimes you are in touch with strange things, otherworldly things.” Writers such as Weil, Olds, Stone, Gillan, and Duhamel transform the little deaths and losses of a lifetime into poetry. They are not afraid to confess and they should not be afraid to be labelled confessional. In true poetry, as Robert Lowell said, “there must be some breakthrough back to life.” This breakthrough back to life depends on the understanding that every life is a train wreck, but amidst the wreckage one can find a form of salvation by recognizing and honoring the shared difficulties that bind us together as human beings. Even if life is difficult and we are burdened with the knowledge that we will one day die, what a miracle that poetry exists and that poets struggle to articulate the fearful symmetries of what remains unsaid.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is an acknowledged truth that the dominant mode in contemporary poetry is the associative. A cursory glance through the nation&#8217;s top journals, or at its most prestigious first-book prizes or its most celebrated contemporary anthologies— at those points, that is, where the zeitgeist most dynamically asserts itself— reveals the extent to which associative poetry has entrenched itself as the lingua franca of American poets. Precisely what those poets mean, however, when they— when we— call a poem “associative” remains, like the mode itself, much more unsettled.</p>
<p>Over the last few years a handful of poet-essayists have attempted to pin down this fugitive sensibility, and in that time a set of shared characteristics has emerged amounting to a loose, working definition of the associative mode. What seems fundamental to association, acknowledged in nearly every description of it, is its effort to represent in language the movement of the 21st-century mind. Barbara Herrnstein Smith calls associative poetry a “transcription, as it were, of an interior monologue” in which “thoughts may develop from each other through casual associations and lead nowhere in particular.” Tony Hoagland notes that “the aspect of self such poems most forcefully represent is its quicksilver uncatchability,” and in his preface to the Legitimate Dangers anthology edited by Michael Dumanis and Cate Marvin, Mark Doty suggests that associative poetry is a “representation of temperament / subjectivity / thinking in the moment.”</p>
<p>Beyond its attempt to register the mind in action, or perhaps because of this attempt, associative poetry seems also characterized by what Joshua Mehigan calls a “whimsical discontinuity” that includes “nonsequential thinking, ellipsis, or dream-like imagery.” Carl Phillips identifies this same sense of discontinuity. “By associative poetry,” he writes, “I mean poetry that works almost entirely by means of association— no connecting narrative pieces, often no syntactical connection, poetry that is characterized by leaps not just from stanza to stanza, but from one image to the next in ways that do not immediately make sense&#8230;” The discontinuity of the associative mode is an aesthetic response to the frenetic, anti-hierarchical experience of postmodernity, an experience in which the human psyche, assaulted by cable news and News Feeds, Twitter and text messages, suffers from a kind of perpetual attention-deficit disorder, leaping about, as these poems do, from one perception to the next.</p>
<p>But if the associative mode has its raison d&#8217;être in the experience of the 21st-century consciousness, it first formed itself, as do all poetic movements, against the poetic mode directly preceding it, namely the narrative mode that dominated American poetry throughout the second half of the 20th century. Among associative poets there exists a profound suspicion of narrative and of narrative poems, a sense that such poetry represents a false, or at least outdated, response to postmodern reality. The rhetoric of narrative poetry, associative poets might argue, functions as exactly that— a glib, rhetorical simplification of a reality in excess of and resistant to the meaning imposed upon it by the organizing narrative voice.</p>
<p>Describing the rhetoric of the narrative mode, and suggesting the artifice behind such a mode, Charles Altieri points out that the poet&#8217;s craft “must be made unobtrusive so that the work appears spoken in a natural voice. [&#8230;] There must be,” he goes on, “a &#8216;studied artlessness&#8217; that gives a sense of spontaneous personal sincerity; and there must be a strong movement toward emphatic closure, a movement carried on primarily by the poet&#8217;s manipulation of narrative structure.” It&#8217;s this last point especially to which associative poets object, arguing that narrative&#8217;s sudden, epiphanic illuminations reinforce the mistaken assumption that traditional structures of meaning-making, whether poetic or socio-cultural, remain firmly in place in the postmodern era. Instead, associative poets prefer, as Dumanis and Marvin put it, “a poem complicated and ambivalent in its emotions in the same way all people are more complicated and ambivalent than they initially let on,” a poem, that is, “reflecting the consciousness of our time.”</p>
<p>In substituting for the reductive, somewhat naive perspective of narrative poetry a more rigorous style properly mimetic of contemporary subjectivity, association recalls high Modernism&#8217;s attempt to distance itself from the antiquated sentimentality of the Romantics, an attitude, most modernists felt, no longer valid in the wake of the first World War. Williams himself traces the origin of associative poetry not to the second but to the first half of the 20th century, in writers like Pound and Eliot, for whom the mode prohibited a more direct focus on the “thing in itself.” In the Prologue to <em>Kora in Hel</em>l, written in 1920, Williams contends that “the true value [of poetry] is that peculiarity which gives an object a character by itself. The associational [&#8230;] value is the false. Its imposition is due to lack of imagination, to an easy lateral sliding.”</p>
<p>Such “lateral sliding” aptly characterizes our own era&#8217;s associative poetry, but in the 1920s it represented for Williams a disastrous setback in poetry&#8217;s effort to render, clearly and sharply, the objective world in which poetry had its roots. The Waste Land, he felt, “wiped out our world as if an atom bomb had been dropped upon it. [&#8230;] I felt at once,” he writes in his Autobiography, “that it had set me back twenty years, and I&#8217;m sure it did. Critically Eliot returned us to the classroom just at the moment when I felt that we were on the point of an escape to matters much closer to the essence of a new art form itself— rooted in the locality which should give it fruit. I knew at once that in certain ways I was most defeated.” At stake in Williams&#8217; objection is the question as to what kind of mimetic response poetry should bring to bear on reality, whether an objective mimesis of the world and its objects— a red wheelbarrow, some Elsie, etc.— or a mimesis, as Williams found in Pound and Eliot, of the mind confronting and ordering this world.</p>
<p>Yet this dichotomy, pointed out by Williams and echoed by critics up to the present day, is in many ways a false one, for both Pound and Eliot began their careers as imagists committed, like Williams, to capturing the hard reality of the world around them. Pound&#8217;s “petals on a wet, black bough,” for example, or Eliot&#8217;s “pair of ragged claws/ Scuttling across the floors of silent seas” could just as easily have been written by Williams himself. Moreover, even these writers&#8217; more associative work, the long poems to which Williams most objected, are ordered in relation to the external world. Both The Waste Land and Pound&#8217;s Cantos, that is, are structured by allusions whose organizing logic lies, at least in part, in the cultural, economic, and historical traditions out of which these poems are written; those traditions may be difficult even for educated readers to identify— “what the thunder said” is certainly not “I have eaten the plums that were in the icebox” — but the associations between them nonetheless refer constantly back to objective reality.</p>
<p>Here, for example, are the opening lines of the Pisan Cantos:</p>
<p>The enormous tragedy of the dream in the peasant&#8217;s bent shoulders<br />
Manes! Manes was tanned and stuffed,<br />
Thus Ben and la Clara a Milano<br />
by the heels at Milano<br />
That maggots shd / eat the dead bullock<br />
DIGONOS, Δίγονος, but the twice crucified<br />
where in history will you find it?</p>
<p>This is no red wheelbarrow, to be sure, but the passage&#8217;s use of association is oriented, as David Perkins points out, toward the external world. The “&#8217;peasant&#8217;s bent shoulders,&#8217;” he explains, “may refer to Benito Mussolini (&#8216;Ben&#8217; in Pound&#8217;s brash way of talking). &#8216;Manes,&#8217;<br />
founder of the Manichaean religion, was crucified[&#8230;] &#8216;Thus&#8217; or analogously with Mussolini and his mistress, whose dead bodies were hung up by the heels at Milan.” [&#8230;] The image of massive strength in the bullock connects with the peasant and with Mussolini. DIGONOS<br />
in Roman and then in Greek letters evokes the god Dionysus. Bringer of a new religion and a new culture, Dionysus makes a subject rhyme with Manes and Mussolini.</p>
<p>Perkins&#8217;s reading demonstrates here the extent to which Pound&#8217;s use of association is organized not by reference to any interiorized self or, recalling Doty, a “temperament / subjectivity / thinking in the moment,” but to objective connections between real-world phenomena. We might bristle, of course, at Pound&#8217;s sympathetic treatment of Mussolini, but the image of him “twice crucified”— as Perkins glosses it, the dictator&#8217;s body was “first trampled and hacked by the mob and then strung up”— is as objectively rendered as almost anything in Williams.</p>
<p>If our contemporary form of association traces its genealogy back to the poetry of the high Moderns, however, it departs from this poetry in the logic by which its associative leaps are organized. For where Pound, Eliot, and even Williams order their association through reference to the external world— to objects certainly, but also to history and economics and art— contemporary associative poets most often order their writing through reference to the self. Here, for example, is Matthea Harvey&#8217;s “The Future of Terror / 1”:</p>
<p>The generalissimo’s glands directed him<br />
to and fro. Geronimo! said the über-goon<br />
we called God, and we were off to the races.<br />
Never mind that we could only grow<br />
gray things, that inspecting the horses’ gums<br />
in the gymnasium predicted a jagged<br />
road ahead. We were tired of hard news—<br />
it helped to turn down our hearing aids.<br />
We could already all do impeccable imitations<br />
of the idiot, his insistent incisors working on<br />
a steak as he said there’s an intimacy to invasion.<br />
That much was true. When we got jaded<br />
about joyrides, we could always play games<br />
in the kitchen garden with the prisoners.<br />
Jump the Gun, Fine Kettle of Fish and Kick<br />
the Kidney were our favorites. The laws<br />
the linguists thought up were particularly<br />
lissome, full of magical loopholes that<br />
spit out medals. We had made the big time,<br />
but night still nipped at our heels.<br />
The navigator’s needle swung strangely,<br />
oscillating between the oilwells<br />
and ask again later. We tried to pull ourselves<br />
together by practicing quarterback sneaks<br />
along the pylons, but the race to the ravine<br />
was starting to feel as real as the R.I.P.’s<br />
and roses carved into rock. Suddenly the sight<br />
of a schoolbag could send us scrambling.</p>
<p>Harvey&#8217;s modified abecedarian depicts childhood as a kind of horse race to an ominous, overwhelming future, an experience in which the innocent play of youth anticipates the more sinister behavior of adults in a postmodern, politically threatening global landscape. Thus, a passage like “we could always play games/ in the kitchen garden with the prisoners” straddles the line between imagination and international relations, just as the “schoolbag” functions as both childhood accoutrement and weapon of mass destruction.</p>
<p>While a discernible cluster of ideas does emerge in “The Future of Terror / 1,” much of the poem remains inaccessible to us, locked in a private system of reference to which we remain barred. Who, for example, are “the linguists” and why are their laws “lissome, full of magical loopholes that/ spit out medals”? Do the “generalissimo’s glands” and “gray things” of the poem&#8217;s opening act as anything more than a kind of warming-up for the poem proper? And while we might follow the allusions to oil prices and Magic 8-balls toward which the “navigator&#8217;s needle” swings, where, exactly, does this navigator come from? In contrast to the external, socio-historical connections among Pound&#8217;s associative leaps, Harvey&#8217;s allusions are linked by their reference to an organizing mind recollecting its past.</p>
<p>Like much of our contemporary associative poetry, “The Future of Terror / 1” strikes a difficult balance between a fast-paced mimesis of the mind in action and the careful aesthetic construction that makes the poem legible, as art, to an audience beyond the self. Describing this balance, Phillips points to the way in which the ostensible mimesis of the associative mode is, like the narrative mode preceding it, in part illusory. “The task for the writer of the associative poem,” Phillips says, “is to give the impression that something has been written in total freedom when in fact that freedom has been necessarily compromised by [&#8230;] the degree to which what we are writing is intelligible to an audience we are pretending does not exist.”</p>
<p>A similar balance is struck in Michael Robbins&#8217; “Confessional Poem”:</p>
<p>You had a woodchuck and an opium ball.<br />
The one ate through the furniture,<br />
the other sat in its cage depressing me.<br />
Now the woodchuck sheds its skin.<br />
I have a cow behind the Dollar Bin.</p>
<p>You shouldn’t drink diarrhea<br />
unless you bring enough for everybody.<br />
Turn it into a teaching moment.<br />
Asian-American Students for Christ<br />
have the room until 2:30.</p>
<p>Rumi says no donkey is a virgin,<br />
no, nor any beast that bites the grass.<br />
Maybe it sounds better in Persian.<br />
An unseen force propels the carts<br />
across the Whole Foods parking lot.</p>
<p>The woodchuck hasn’t been born yet<br />
I’d rather keep than you as a pet.<br />
You’ll sleep on wood shavings, I’ll comb your pelt.<br />
That animal loved you, his captor,<br />
whom he hated. I know just how he felt.</p>
<p>Like Eliot&#8217;s and Pound&#8217;s long poems, Robbins&#8217; parodic “Confessional Poem” is riddled with cultural allusions, and like Harvey&#8217;s poem there&#8217;s meaning to be made here. The poem begins, for instance, by lampooning confessional poetry&#8217;s trendy revealing of— and reveling in— major depressive disorders, as suggested by the speaker&#8217;s “hav[ing] a cow behind the Dollar Bin.” In the same way, it inverts in the second stanza the pat clichés— “unless you bring enough for everybody,” “teaching moment”— on which our culture too often relies, critiquing the lack of sophistication in a society in which religion has displaced rationality and in which Rumi, to this day the best-selling poet in this country, is appropriated as a kind of New Age spiritualist.</p>
<p>The poem seems to express a wry ambivalence to the fact that out of such a culture poetry itself must be made; thus its final stanza oscillates between the need to coddle the “you” reader by approaching him on a level— and with a language— he can understand and the consequent hatred of that reader for compromising the poet&#8217;s aesthetic commitment. “Confessional Poem” might be read, then, as an allegory for associative poetry itself, particularly the way such poetry seeks a balance between documenting the idiosyncratic postmodern subjectivity— I still can&#8217;t make sense of Robbins&#8217; woodchuck or opium ball or donkey— and, on the other side of this balance, its commitment to an audience with what might be a vastly different set of cultural references.</p>
<p>When this balance is lost, when association shades into dissociation and a poem&#8217;s allusions seem too anarchistic, the poem becomes self-indulgent, its allusions a kind of private reference or inside joke to which the reader is not privy. Dissociative poetry— a term which characterizes much of our contemporary writing— brands itself as mysterious, postmodern, or playful when in fact such poetry tends more toward obfuscation, clumsily executed and, at worst, devoid of meaning. “Cute and empty” Mehigan calls this poetry; “privileging the arty over art itself,” says Phillips.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Heather Christle&#8217;s “Letter to My Love”:</p>
<p>Dear lord, you are no back-breaking orchid.<br />
You will give that man your last dollar.<br />
When I meet you, lord, I curtsy, chop and mitigate<br />
the customs, and you, my muff-diving butternut<br />
go whooping through the corridor like it’s the last<br />
day of summer and you’re Mr. Moneybags<br />
reminding us all to tread sloppy water.<br />
Lord, I saw the kettles gather in the stonefields.<br />
I saw the miniscus fall asleep.<br />
When the masons shook their glory<br />
from their bright and feathered hairdos<br />
I turned away, lord, turned to see you<br />
gallop down the highway. Where were you<br />
headed? Even now, a light year<br />
from that beating, I want to know.</p>
<p>The poem is a competent postmodern lyric of the sort that one finds flipping at random through any of the nation&#8217;s top journals. There&#8217;s strong writing here— “When the masons shook their glory/ from their bright and feathered hairdos” is gorgeous iambic tetrameter— and there&#8217;s even the vague suggestion of a kind of narrative meaning, as the speaker confronts a patriarchal figure with whom she exists in vexed relationship, both subject to and flouting that figure&#8217;s authority. But the images in the poem— “back-breaking orchid,” “Mr. Moneybags/ reminding us all to tread sloppy water”— fail to cohere into any kind of meaningful association, and the lack of connective tissue between them creates the impression of a forced, deliberate strangeness; put another way, the poem simply tries too hard to be weird.</p>
<p>The cultivated obscurity of “Letter to My Love” situates the poem as part of what W.S. Di Piero calls “the new hermeticism,” a term Di Piero coined in 1981 but which hasn&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t think, received as much critical attention as it deserves. Lacking “clarity of context,” the poetry of the new hermeticism is a kind of “privileged concealment” in which “evocativeness takes precedence over definiteness” and “the world of things exists primarily as a pretext for fanciful metaphor.” As a result, Di Piero argues, the new hermeticism “estranges speech from its social origins and stands aloof from poetry&#8217;s traditional work of quarreling with human and divine orders.”</p>
<p>It&#8217;s to this estrangement from the social that I want to turn in the second half of this essay, for one effect of the contemporary dissociative mode has been further to alienate poetry&#8217;s already disaffected popular readership, its readers, that is, beyond the halls of academia and the poetry world itself. My aim here is not some “Is Poetry Dead?”/”Can Poetry Matter?” hand-wringing examination of conscience, but to explore rather how dissociation, in privileging ultimately private systems of meaning and reference, turns its back on an American public for whom poetry— despite the premature postmortems for it that seem to pop up every month or so now— remains a vital and valued art.</p>
<p>The problem is an old one. Like the associative mode, the divorce between poetry and its public reaches back to the high Moderns, in particular their effort to supplant an overly saccharin Romanticism with a poetry of wit and intellect, a neo-Metaphysical poetry in which the philosophical and literary tradition itself became the dominant point of reference. And this tension, between erudition and emotion, intellectual rigor and popular appeal, has been a persistent source of anxiety for poets throughout the 20th century to the present day.</p>
<p>In a 1951 essay entitled &#8220;The Obscurity of the Poet,&#8221; Randall Jarrell lays the blame for poetry&#8217;s growing irrelevance at the feet of the public, arguing that the technological innovations of the 20th century— including those same media from which associative poetry adopts its frantic, distracted leaping— have destroyed, he says, “in a great many people even the capacity for understanding real poetry, real art of any kind.” Citing a 1950 survey which revealed that 48% of Americans read no book at all that year, Jarrell suggests that “people who have inherited the custom of not reading poets justify it by referring to the obscurity of the poems they have never read.” Instead of “having to perceive, to enter, and to interpret” poems as independent works of art, Jarrell argues, the American reader “can notice at a glance whether or not these pay lip service to his own &#8216;principles,&#8217; and can then praise or blame them accordingly.”</p>
<p>Attractive as Jarrell&#8217;s narrative of cultural decline may be to contemporary poets, including myself, who mourn the loss of a wider, more democratic audience for poetry, there&#8217;s nonetheless a real contempt for the American public here. Reminiscent of the New Criticism&#8217;s effort to entrench the difficult, Modernist poem within the halls of academia, Jarrell&#8217;s argument also anticipates the spurning of the public characteristic of our own dissociative mode. In fact, I&#8217;d argue, the average American reader still very much cherishes the idea of poets and of poetry, and not simply in a fuzzy, overly romantic, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow-by-the-fireside kind of way.</p>
<p>An almost weekly conversation in the workshop of which I&#8217;m a part is whether, when asked on planes or in doctors&#8217; offices or on first dates what one does for a living, one responds with “I&#8217;m a writer” or “I&#8217;m a poet.” The latter, the consensus seems to hold, conjures images of a pale, hypersensitive waif dying of consumption in a gutter or, conversely, some doe-eyed bohemian dancing through fields of sunflowers. But it&#8217;s precisely to counter these images, I think, that one should call oneself a poet in the first place, to lend an actual, human face to the term, and in so doing to insist that poetry, far from the cultivation of some hermetically-sealed interiority, is an act that belongs in the real world of 21st-century America— on airplanes, in doctors&#8217; offices, on first dates, and in the countless other social settings in which poetry has its origin.</p>
<p>When I tell people I&#8217;m a poet, their responses are more often than not enthusiastic. They tell me about their uncle who was a poet, or about how their mother read Frost to them when they were children, or about a workshop they took as an undergraduate. Before surgery a few weeks ago, as the nurse hooked up the IV tubes and clipped the pulse monitor to my finger, she asked what I did for a living, and when I told her I wrote poetry her face lit up; she told me that her niece, an eleven-year-old, had just won a poetry competition at her middle school, and as she wheeled me down the hall to the operating room she said that she&#8217;d look for my poems online. These anecdotes might be sentimental, but they suggest both the enduring vitality of poetry and the excitement it can still generate in a popular American audience. When dissociation flouts this human vitality, however, when it eschews what I&#8217;ve called the connective tissue that might bind it more closely to the social, it&#8217;s no wonder that whatever audience once existed for American poetry has given up on it.</p>
<p>Anticipating what Di Piero diagnoses as the new hermeticism, Perkins argues that “poetry in the modern world has become so self-conscious and specialized that it is in danger of sealing itself off from life. It is so on the defensive against larger genres that it feels the temptation to abandon the field, retreating into acknowledged littleness.” Likewise, in a short essay in The Washington Post last year, Alexandra Petri argued that “what we mean by poetry is a limp and fangless thing.” These writers couldn&#8217;t be more wrong. For despite the way dissociation threatens to turn poetry in on itself, sealing it off from our shared cultural experience, there exists today an abundance of exciting, sophisticated work being written in the associative mode, work which strikes that crucial balance between private and public and which preserves both intellectual and aesthetic rigor while joining the self, sometimes fitfully, to the society of which it&#8217;s a part.</p>
<p>Here, for example, is Victoria Chang&#8217;s “Today my daughter”:</p>
<p>Today my daughter wants to be a waitress when she<br />
grows up she doesn’t know that a waitress is<br />
not a boss that a waitress takes orders from everyone<br />
that a waitress must run to a bell to the</p>
<p>phone to the customer to the supervisor who is super<br />
bossy and wears a greasy visor<br />
yesterday my daughter wanted to be a pet doctor<br />
the Barbie book has fuzzy pets furry pets</p>
<p>cute pets with small noses Barbie doesn’t show her<br />
missing finger from the cute pet that bit it off<br />
the Barbie is not the boss the dog is the boss Ken is<br />
the boss of the dog who likes the dog in a</p>
<p>pink outfit who likes Barbie in little skirts with little hips<br />
if a perfect woman like Barbie is not the boss then<br />
who can ever be the boss even the man in HR the man<br />
who can fire everyone cannot be the boss</p>
<p>because he has a boss who hired him who can fire<br />
him and even the man who hired the HR man<br />
has a boss who can fire him there are fires all over<br />
Japan right now the fire and water both want</p>
<p>to be the boss all the bosses in Japan lost their jobs<br />
lost their limbs bob in water no longer care<br />
about Bob the boss in America no longer<br />
care about cost</p>
<p>Chang&#8217;s poem is associative to the core, its images joined by a logic that constantly turns this poem outward, to the world, while retaining a powerful emotional resonance. Refusing the reductiveness of narrative structure, but refusing too to slip into hermeticism, or to a posed, artificial strangeness, the poem almost literally spirals out— no other verb seems to capture the dizzying effect of the syntax here— from the personal to the political, linking her daughter&#8217;s play to gender politics in corporate America to the 2011 tsunami in Japan and the subsequent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.</p>
<p>If, as Perkins argues, poetry in the postmodern era has retreated to minor themes, leaving politics and philosophy, economics and ecology to other fields and more relevant art forms, Chang&#8217;s use of association reminds us that poetry can be big again, that it was and is a major art worthy of taking on the most pressing public crises of our day. And those crises are many. But so are we. Di Piero writes that the poetry of the new hermeticism “ignores the disciplines of remembrance” but we should remember now that the root of “association” is the social, and that the word in Latin originally denoted the “action of coming together,” “a body of persons with a common purpose.” So may it mean again.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rocks<br />
From a freeway overpass in Central Pennsylvania, four teenage boys fling rocks at traffic passing beneath them along Route 80. One misses hitting anything but the highway. One nearly the size of a bowling ball bounces off the cab of a semi. At last, one strikes the windshield of a car heading east. When the car immediately slows, pulls off the highways, and parks, the boys hurry to their car and drive off.</p>
<p>Space Junk<br />
In 1962, a twenty-one pound metal object plummeted from the sky and landed at the intersection of two streets in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. Eventually, it was confirmed to be the remnant of Sputnik IV, becoming the first example of a significant piece of space junk surviving re-entry after falling out of orbit. When first noticed, it was imbedded three inches deep in the asphalt street.</p>
<p>Powder<br />
In 1969, in South Carolina, a white cloud spewed from the new Borden plant near the small town of Chester. It rose and drifted and hovered above the town, eventually beginning to fall. The day became white and sweet like the air above a rolling pin thinning cookie dough. Children stood beside their mothers, their hands clutching toys they would not part with. The weather seemed to cut the neighborhood into the shapes of families. The cloud was soluble on tongues. It surrounded each face. Already there were footprints on sidewalks, the anticipation of brooms. Some of those dusted by that shower took vows. As if time was ending, there were declarations of love and promises to do better. But not for long. The powder turned out to be Borden’s nondairy creamer. The company offered reassurance. Though later, when the whitened bathed, some of them stroked the film that had formed along their cheeks, their fingertips dizzy with the wonder of children touching the rouged faces of the dead.</p>
<p>Nuclear Bombs<br />
The United States government calls nuclear bombs that go astray &#8220;Broken Arrows.&#8221; Four such broken arrows fell from the sky on January 17th, 1966 when two US Air Force planes collided over southern Spain. A B-52G bomber was struck by the KC-135 tanker plane sent to perform routine air-to-air refueling and broke apart. Three of the bomber&#8217;s H-bombs landed in or around Palomares; the fourth landed about five miles offshore in the Mediterranean. There was no nuclear blast, but plutonium was scattered over a wide area.</p>
<p>Rocks<br />
Sharon Budd, a middle school teacher from Ohio, is a passenger in the car the boys hit. She is struck full in the face. In her husband Randy’s 911 call, he says, “This is bad. Something came right through the windshield.” He is unhurt. So is the driver, his nineteen year-old daughter. “There’s a rock that came in,” he goes on. “She’s grasping for her life. My God, half her brain is gone. Oh, my God.” His daughter can be heard screaming during the 911 call.</p>
<p>Space Junk<br />
Nearly every day during the winter when my younger son was thirteen, he searched the sky for the first sign of space junk that was forecast soon to tumble out of orbit. “What if it lands here?” he asked more than once, and each time I told him that was so close to impossible there was no sense even thinking about it. “But not 100% impossible, right?” he said, and he began to research the size and weight of what was about to fall, how much of it might survive re-entry. He relayed the following details to me:<br />
The name of the object is Salyut 7, the last of nine space stations the Soviet Union launched from 1971 to 1982. It blasted off on April 19, 1982, and has stayed aloft for nearly nine years. Six different resident crews have spent time aboard during its operational life. It is about 52 feet long and 13.6 feet across at its widest point. It weighs about 22 tons. A spaceship called Cosmos 1686 is still docked to the station. It weighs just as much as the space station, and all 44 tons of it is about to plummet toward Earth.</p>
<p>Seeds<br />
A father calls his wife and children outside to witness the eastern sky turning dim with clouds the color of blood. They stand transfixed, staring skyward until rain falls like a swarm of sand. They live in Italy. The year is 1897. What falls are seeds, all of them from Judas trees, none of which grow anywhere near them. The light after the shower is so yellow it seems to have traveled from a jaundiced star. The father kneels to run his hands over those seeds, reading the Braille of what might be said by a solid rain.</p>
<p>Nuclear Bombs<br />
The bombs that fell near Palomares from the destroyed plane weren&#8217;t armed, so there was no nuclear explosion. Parachutes attached to the bombs were supposed to bear them gently down to earth, preventing any contamination, but two of the parachutes failed to open, and those bombs blew apart on impact, scattering highly toxic, radioactive plutonium dust, a major hazard to anyone who might inhale it. And there was the issue of finding the one that fell offshore.</p>
<p>Rocks<br />
Randy Budd says his wife had just finished speaking with their eldest son before the vehicle was struck by the rock. After hanging up the phone, his wife asked their son to send her a selfie from his station in Fort Bliss, Texas, which he did. “I really miss you,” he texted. Shortly after, the windshield exploded. Randy adds, “I didn’t know where her head was.”</p>
<p>Space Junk<br />
My son asked to sleep downstairs in the room where his older brother had lived before going off to college. From time to time I caught him walking with his eyes focused on the sky. “Will we be able to see it coming?” he asked, and when I said, “Not likely,” he had me go outside with him with binoculars. He worried that most of the late January and early February days were cloudy. By then he understood that the space station and its attached ship would break apart and mostly disintegrate before it reached Earth, but still he worried. “So many pieces makes it worse,” he said. The whole thing plunged back to Earth on Feb. 7, 1991, breaking up over Argentina. Some debris was discovered scattered over a town called Capitan Bermudez. There were no reported injuries.</p>
<p>Small Stones<br />
When I was in first grade I was proud of being able to throw stones across the wide street in front of the house where we rented three upstairs rooms. I stood on the wall that ran up from the sidewalk and waited for cars to drive by in the far lane, tossing small rocks over them as they passed. Standing on the wall gave me the advantage of height. The stones, hardly more than pebbles, looked to my six year-old eyes as if they were arcing down from the sky. Eventually, one fell short and landed on the windshield of a blue car. When the car pulled into the alley beside the house and the driver stepped out, I ran inside, up the stairs and into the room I shared with my older sister. Within a minute a man was speaking with my mother about the small crack the stone had made.<br />
The crack, it turned out, was tiny and so far into the corner of the glass that unless it spread, the driver wouldn’t ask for money. All I had to do was apologize, forcing the words out between sobs.</p>
<p>Nuclear Bombs<br />
Nobody on the ground in Palomares was killed by the falling bombs. 700 US airmen and scientists were employed to search for bombs and clean up. Three inches of topsoil was removed, sealed in 4,810 barrels and shipped to a storage facility in the United States. Twenty ships, including mine-sweepers and submersibles, were deployed by the US Navy to find the missing bomb that was in the Mediterranean. The cost of the sea search was over $10 million. Four months later, the missing bomb was finally hoisted on board a US warship from a depth of 2,850 ft. How much plutonium is still near Palomares is unknown.</p>

The teenage rock throwers’ names are brothers Dylan and Brett Lahr, Tyler Porter, and Keefer McGee. McGee was driving his Mitsubishi Eclipse when they stopped on the overpass near Route 80’s Milton Exit. When the car below them slowed, they fled to the house where the brothers lived. They tried to watch a movie, but dying to know how much damage they’d caused, they got in the Lahr’s gold Honda Accord and drove past the scene to see what was happening. When they saw a police car, they returned to the house. They went back yet again and saw more police cruisers. The police took notice of the Honda’s license plate.</p>
<p>Documents<br />
In 1973 a set of papers fell from a distance higher than a nearby 300-foot radio transmission tower. It looked, to the witness, as if a briefcase had opened, a latch sprung loose among the clouds. A hoax was suspected, but a few lines about the event eventually appeared in a newspaper. The documents, it was reported, were full of graphs and formulas that explained “normalized extinction” and the Davis-Greenstein mechanism of astrophysics.</p>
<p>Nuclear Bombs<br />
My first air raid drill was in second grade. Everyone in the grade school was herded downstairs to the basement and told to stand against a wall away from any windows. Close your eyes, the teacher said, don’t open them until I tell you. After that, we had those twice a year. We had fire drills once a month. In third grade we dropped beneath our desks and covered our heads with our hands. “All clear,” the teacher said both times. The school was six miles from Pittsburgh. She told us that the city and its steel mills were prime targets. “Pittsburgh is very important,” the teacher said, something I always remembered when the nearby fire station tested its air raid siren. “Could we see the bomb falling?” I asked her, and she answered, “Don’t you worry about that.” Every time I was home alone when the sirens wailed, my father sleeping, my mother at work, I watched the sky believing this was the time the warning was for real.</p>

At the hospital, the teacher’s forehead and skull cap was removed to allow for swelling in her brain. She had lost an eye and the other was severely damaged. In a short period of time, she underwent five surgeries, first to save her life, then to reconstruct her face, and, at last, to provide her with an artificial skull cap. In the first newspaper report after the boys were arrested, one of them denies throwing any rocks as if abstinence is a synonym for innocence</p>

Not rare, these things falling from the sky. In fact, they are so common that a standard reason is provided by scientists&#8211;whirlwinds sucki up water and carry what’s in it until everything falls from the sky.</p>
<p>Nuclear Bombs<br />
A B-52 was flying over North Carolina on January 24, 1961, when it suffered what was reported as a &#8220;failure of the right wing” and two atom bombs plummeted toward the ground near Goldsboro. The parachute opened on one; it didn&#8217;t on the other. The bomb whose parachute opened landed intact. The bomb with the unopened parachute landed in a free fall. The impact of the crash put it in the &#8220;armed&#8221; setting, but another part of the bomb needed to initiate an explosion was damaged, and it did not explode. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara said, &#8220;By the slightest margin of chance, literally the failure of two wires to cross, a nuclear explosion was averted.&#8221;</p>

When I search for other incidents of rocks thrown from overpasses onto passing cars and trucks, there are dozens of stories. The one closest to where I live and where Sharon Budd was struck happened shortly after. A man was driving his Kenworth truck on state Route 924 within a few miles of the Budd incident when a rock crashed through his windshield. However, it missed striking him. When I move to recent incidents farther away, I read about a man who was driving home on Interstate 35 near Austin, Texas when a rock came through his windshield and smashed into his face. He is paralyzed on his right side and is unable to talk or write, according to a television report on KEYE. Another station KXAN reports that three other motorists were injured in rock throwing incidents on the same highway within a month of the one that paralyzed that driver.</p>
<p>Concrete<br />
One afternoon, just after recess ended, a corner of concrete from just under the roof of my elementary school broke off and fell fifty feet into the playground. Our teacher kept us in our seats. She told us to pay attention to what we were doing, not what was happening outside, but when school ended, everyone I knew veered out of the path to where the school buses waited to take a look at the crash site. We all knew exactly how long it had been since we had stood in the spot where the stone struck the cement. Last week. Yesterday. That morning. Minutes before.</p>

I look for a more recent example of enormous objects falling from orbit and find the story of the 6.5-ton UARS satellite. NASA&#8217;s space shuttle Discovery deployed the climate satellite in September 1991. The $750 million satellite was decommissioned by NASA in December 2005. When it fell to Earth, the event was reported this way:<br />
NASA estimates that UARS will come crashing back to Earth Friday night (Sept. 23) or Saturday morning (Sept. 24). At the moment, they&#8217;re not sure precisely where; pretty much anywhere on the planet between the latitudes of northern Canada and southern South America is a possibility. About 1,170 pounds of UARS&#8217; 6.5-ton bulk will survive re-entry. NASA pegs the chance of a piece of UARS debris hitting anybody anywhere in the world at 1 in 3,200.</p>
<p>Nuclear Bombs<br />
Two months after the incident near Goldsboro, another B-52 was flying in the western United States when the cabin depressurized and the crew ejected, leaving the pilot to steer the bomber away from populated areas. The plane crashed in Yuba City, California, but safety devices prevented the two onboard nuclear weapons from detonating.</p>

When asked by reporters who are covering the Sharon Budd story, Pennsylvania state police can&#8217;t say how many times someone threw an object that struck a vehicle last year, because its database lumps those incidents in with incidents in which something lands on a highway. What is known is that in 2013, troopers responded to 213 &#8220;assault-propulsion of missile&#8221; incidents that include both categories. The numbers of such incidents was 229 in 2012, and 282 in 2011. What the reporters also learn is that in Pennsylvania, fences are erected on highway overpasses in urban areas that have sidewalks and are near a school or playgrounds. The Gray Hill Road overpass in the New Columbia area from which the rock was thrown that hit the Budd car doesn&#8217;t meet that criteria because it’s in a rural area, with no sidewalk. The overpass is 22 feet high.</p>
<p>Water Balloons<br />
At the beginning of ninth grade, at the high school band picnic, I followed four other freshmen and one sophomore up the winding outside staircase that led to the top of the water tower at Allegheny County’s North Park. The sophomore had given us balloons to fill with water and shown us how to tie them securely. I had two that wobbled in my hands. Some of the other boys balanced two in each hand. “There’s always somebody who doesn’t know we’re up here,” the sophomore said. He played French horn. I played trombone, and by the time we reached the 100 foot-high observation deck, I was uneasy with the height and being associated with boys who thought tossing water balloons was cool. Every other boy screamed when a balloon burst close enough to somebody to soak them. I was the only one who didn’t lean over the railing to see the damage. Before the last balloons were tossed, I made my way down the stairs and hoped that anyone coming up the 154 metal steps would remember that I wasn’t part of the group that tossed the balloons, that anyone soaked would see me half way down while the next balloon arced toward them.</p>
<p>Nuclear Bombs<br />
The Defense Department has disclosed 32 accidents involving nuclear weapons between 1950 and 1980. Nuclear weapons were lost, accidentally dropped, jettisoned for safety reasons or on board planes that crashed. The accidents occurred in various U.S. states, Greenland, Spain, Morocco and England, and over the Pacific and Atlantic oceans and the Mediterranean Sea. Another five accidents occurred when planes were taxiing or parked.</p>
<p>More Powder<br />
On July 10, 1976, an explosion at a northern Italian chemical plant released a thick, white cloud. Close by was the town of Seveso, and the powder quickly settled upon it.<br />
Soon small animals began to die. Cats. Dogs. It took four days before people felt sick. They were nauseous. They had blurred vision. And things were worse with their children, who broke out in a skin disease known as chloracne. The town wasn’t evacuated until weeks later. The white mist that fell on Seveso was dioxin. After a while, the residents returned. Eventually, babies were born disfigured. Liver disease became common.</p>

The police questioned Ron Johnson, who lives only 100 feet from the Gray Hill Road overpass. He mentioned to them that kids had tossed rocks at tractor trailers from the same bridge about seven years ago. “Then they put the signs up, ‘No standing on bridge,’ and there for a while the cops were coming by on a regular basis checking. But nothing happened, so the cops stopped coming by.”</p>

The largest stone meteorite in recorded history struck Earth near Kirin, China in 1976. More than 100 pieces of the original large meteor reached Earth, some of them weighing hundreds of pounds. One The weighed 3,902 pounds, the largest ever recovered.</p>
<p>Pennies<br />
When I was fifteen I watched as a friend sailed a penny out a window from the 25th floor of the University of Pittsburgh’s Cathedral of Learning. “If you’re high enough,” he’d said, “a falling penny will kill somebody.” We rushed to look down, but I already knew there was no way he could throw it far enough out to have it hit the ground without bouncing off the outside walls that were built wider at the bottom like a narrow wedding cake. When I said so, he threw another. “We should go higher,” he said, but we couldn’t get access to any of the seventeen floors above us, the full 535 feet of height. Minutes later, on the street, there was no sign of anyone harmed by the pennies he’d tossed from about 300 feet high.</p>
<p>Nuclear Bombs<br />
A website, nuclearsecrecy.com, allows users to simulate nuclear explosions. It says that one bomb the size of the two that fell on North Carolina in 1961 would emit thermal radiation over a 15-mile radius. Wind conditions, of course, could change that. The website warns that calculating casualties is problematic. Population clusters vary. So does topography.</p>
<p>Rocks<br />
There have been reports of fatalities from rock throwing incidents, including two drivers killed by rocks as big as soccer balls tossed onto a German highway in 2000. Like the boys who hit the Budd car, all of those rock throwers were teenagers. They were charged with murder.</p>

Twenty-six large asteroids have exploded in the Earth’s atmosphere in the first thirteen years of the 21st Century, all of the explosions registering the power of at least one kiloton. The frequency of an asteroid striking earth with the power to destroy a large city is calculated at about once per century.</p>

One famously landed on a car in San Diego, dropping from a mid-air accident like a fantastically narrow storm. The driver and her child were unharmed, but afterward, she had a habit of glancing up like a weather forecaster. An episode of the television series Six Feet Under begins with a scene that recreates this improbable landing.</p>

I learn that before the boys threw rocks, they drove through a corn field to see how much damage they could do, and I remember riding through a corn field in a car as a freshman in college. It was October, not July. “We do this every year,” the driver, a townie, said. “We’re not hurting anything. It’ll just all get cut down in a few weeks anyway.” I was anxious the entire time we plowed through the stalks, not because I was worried about being caught, but because it was so hard to see that anything could have been in front of us before that driver could react. The farmer, knowing this vandalism happened every October, could have laid boulders in the field, anticipating the annual car full of teenage jerks.</p>

The largest iron meteorite weighs more than 60 tons. It was discovered in 1920, on a farm in Namibia. It is now a national monument visited by tourists.</p>

It’s rare to believe a body is falling from a cloud. It takes height that turns us breathless, a thousand feet or more to make us think “sky.” In high school physics class, we learned Newton’s Second Law, the one that offers a formula for the acceleration of a falling object: g=32 ft. per second squared. The velocity of the falling object could be calculated by the formula v=g x time. The World Trade Centers were over 1300 feet high. The morning of the terrorist attacks distance and speed throttled our breath while suited bodies plunged like drops of a passing shower. Those bodies were falling about 120 miles per hour when they hit the ground. They have been filmed. They have been watched again and again. How some held hands when they leaped. The sky, that morning, was clear.</p>
<p>Nuclear Bombs<br />
In December 1965, a month before the accident at Palomares, the James Bond film Thunderball was released. The story line was eerily similar. Bond&#8217;s mission was to find atomic bombs that had been lost at sea, and news stories about Palomares made the connection. In real life, it was much harder to locate and recover the bomb from the seabed.</p>

Four months after the incident, as part of a plea deal, Keefer McGee agrees to testify against his friends. In court, he says, “We decided to throw rocks at cars, just go out and be bad.” He describes how, when they reached the overpass, Dylan and Tyler jumped out armed with rocks they’d gathered earlier. “There was a loud crash when Dylan’s stone hit,” he says. “We all laughed as we drove away.”</p>

The newly completed World Trade Center is 1776 feet tall with its antenna, a 408-foot spire, included. The builders have called the antenna a mast to insure the Trade Center is judged the tallest building in the United States rather than the Willis (formerly Sears) Tower in Chicago. The new Trade Center has fewer floors but has been designated tallest by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat. In Chicago, years ago, my friend refused to go up in the Sears Tower, so I went alone. As always when I was close enough to the edge to see down into the city, every instinct told me to stay back, but the safety shield was high enough for even me to relax. Even so, riding down in the elevator felt like rescue.</p>
<p>Nuclear Bombs<br />
University of California-Los Angeles researchers estimate that, respectively, Hiroshima and Nagasaki had populations of about 330,000 and 250,000 when they were bombed in August 1945. By that December, the cities&#8217; death tolls included, by conservative estimates, at least 90,000 and 60,000 people. All of the United States nuclear bombs involved in major accidents since then were far more powerful than those.</p>

Sharon Budd spent weeks in an induced coma. It took thirteen hours of surgery to reconstruct her face. The surgeon said it was the worst case he’d ever seen. In a later interview, Randy Budd talked about growing up in a rough Ohio neighborhood, learning early to take care of himself. How that affected his feelings about the four boys. “There’s only a few ways I have of if someone does something wrong to you how to handle it.”</p>

People have experimented with postures in the air to acquire maximum velocity.<br />
The record free fall speed is 330 mph within ordinary atmosphere. However, claims have been made for falling at beyond the speed of sound from the upper atmosphere. Jumping from the stratosphere in 2012, Felix Baumgartner became the first man to break the speed of sound in free fall. He climbed to 128,100 feet in a helium-filled balloon. Recently, Alan Eustace, a senior vice president at Google, fell from the top of the stratosphere, plummeting nearly 26 vertical miles in the span of about 15 minutes. In doing so, he broke Baumgartner&#8217;s 2012 record for world&#8217;s highest-altitude free fall. The official figure on Eustace&#8217;s maximum altitude was given as 135,890 feet, or 25.74 miles. On his return to Earth, Eustace achieved a top speed of 822 miles per hour, breaking the sound barrier and generating a sonic boom, but shy of Baumgartner&#8217;s Guiness Book of Records approved speed of 833.9 mph.</p>

In October, when Sharon Budd steps out of the Geisinger Medical Center for the first time, she wears a pink #BuddStrong t-shirt. Her artificial skull is covered by a pink and white knit cap. Outside the rehab facility, she is filmed ringing a victory bell reserved for patients who overcome long odds. When she first entered the facility, she was so confused she couldn’t manage any of the therapy. Three months since the incident, she has no memory of it. I watch the video of the event several times. As she walks, Sharon Budd is braced on both sides by smiling attendants. At the victory bell ceremony, she is still lightly supported. According to her doctor, she is now “nearly independent, walking with a little assistance, able to take care of herself.”</p>

In November, Sharon Budd’s family notices seepage coming from a scar that runs across her forehead. She has to undergo a sixth surgery at Geisinger Medical Center to treat an infection underneath her artificial skull. The cap is removed and has to remain off for four to six weeks. Now she must wear a protective helmet but is able to return home. However, she will need to come back to Geisinger every two weeks for an exam.</p>
<p>Pebbles<br />
It’s not far to the now-infamous section of Route 80. Within half an hour, I’m traveling east and looking up at the overpass. I keep my speed. The odds of being devastatingly struck seem impossible, and yet I slow as soon as I pass under and have to fight the urge to stop on the shoulder like a re-enactor.</p>
<p>It’s harder to work my way on unfamiliar back roads to reach the overpass. When I reach it, I park and look over, but each time a car approaches I expect it to stop, some driver stepping out to accuse me of rubbernecking or worse. When I feel patches of gravel under my shoes, I bend and gather a small handful. I look both ways and wait for the highway below me to clear before lofting those specks into the air.</p>

The two boys who were seventeen at the time want to be tried as juveniles. The lawyers for all the boys want certain evidence to be suppressed when their clients come to trial. Most important, they say, is not to admit as evidence the 911 call made by Mr. Budd. Likewise, pictures of Mrs. Budd should not be permitted to be shown. They are prejudicial, the lawyers claim. These exhibits are too emotionally charged.</p>
