								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Faith in Fiction: Rebecca Makkai’s <em>Music for Wartime</em></p>
<p>“You’re not necessarily supposed to believe it,” Daniel Wallace writes as he strikes at the nature of storytelling in his 1998 novel <em>Big Fish</em>. “You’re just supposed to believe in it.” With this ideal in mind, Rebecca Makkai skillfully blurs the line between reality and fiction in her compilation of short stories entitled <em>Music for Wartime</em>. Mirroring the title of the collection, each of these seventeen stories mixes art and beauty with actuality and hardship, creating something both believably realistic and implausibly fictitious. Her stories range widely in topic from the death of a traveling circus elephant, to a lonely real-estate agent who falls in love with Johann Sebastian Bach, to a musical prodigy with ominous premonitions. Makkai uses these odd plot lines and varying levels of fantasy to insinuate that the complete verity of a story does not matter as long as one believes in the message and emotion it conveys.</p>
<p>Some of the stories in Makkai’s collection conform fully to the realm of fantasy. “Couple of Lovers on a Red Background,” for example, tells of a young woman who, while playing the piano one morning, coughs up Bach, the renowned eighteenth century composer, passes out, and later finds him in the back of her piano. She formulates a plan to seduce Bach so the offspring that she desperately desires will be a musical genius like its father. Despite the far-fetched nature of this situation, she exhibits incredibly human frustrations, desires, and weaknesses. For example, her soon-to-be ex-husband, she tells Bach one night, emotionally shut down after September 11: “I say, ‘So your whole vague, lapsed-Episcopal belief in God was based on those buildings being there? On nothing bad ever happening?’ It was like he’d never previously registered that there was evil in the world…And then Larry says I was more upset when we miscarried last year than when the towers got hit.” (93-94). Makkai uses the arrival of Bach in the middle of real-world trauma to comment on the pain that this couple suffers. This added supernatural layer tactfully uncovers her protagonist’s true heart in a way that a realistic plotline could not.</p>
<p>While not as fantastical as “Couple of Lovers on a Red Background,” other stories in her collection also sit on the cusp of reality and imagination. In “The Miracle Years of Little Fork,” for example, Makkai tells the story of a traveling circus elephant that dies during one of the circus’s stops in a small town. The performers stay in the town of Little Fork for a while in order to bury the elephant and adequately grieve, which causes a disruption of the citizens’ daily lives. These events, while slightly unusual, are not unequivocally fantastical. It is Makkai’s telling of them that pushes the story over the ledge into the domain of fantasy. “All this happened a very long time ago,” she writes. By mixing in this fairy tale and biblical diction and imagery, Makkai frays the edges of what could be a believable story. The town is plagued with a 40-day-and-night flood. A pregnant girl is hidden away in a tower and her caretaker, the pastor in the town, is often seen as a knight in shining armor rather than “just a man like me” (49). This all occurs in the midst of an ambiguous, far-away war. Makkai covers the story in this veil of fantasy in order to speak candidly about faith.</p>
<p>Even one of her most realistic stories, “November Story,” speaks to the constant manipulation of reality. This story tells of Christine, a woman working behind the scenes on a reality television show and simultaneously dealing with her deteriorating romantic relationship. Christine’s job is to interview contestants, poking and prodding them as she molds their words into something the producers want to hear. “It’s sick and it’s soulless, but it’s one of the addictive things about my job,” she says. “Here, you can force the world to be something it’s not” (35). Her girlfriend, distant and apathetic, accuses her of “playing God” (28). Christine spends her career constructing a fake reality for the world to see, ironically at the same time her personal reality is falling apart. Despite its lack of plagues, fairy tale imagery or time traveling composers, Makkai illustrates in this story that humans constantly distort the world around them.</p>
<p>Through this interconnection of fictions and facts, Makkai weaves the consistent motif of music and art to bring in another layer of magic and otherworldliness in order to uncover a greater truth in <em>Music for Wartime</em>. Art in itself, like fantastic elements in a story, distorts what is real so that others can see reality more clearly. Bach’s music, the art of a circus performer, and the creation of a television show bend reality in such a way that illuminate something much deeper than could be told in a realistic manner. It is why humans return again and again to art, music and storytelling. It’s not quite believable, as Wallace admits, but can be believed in. And that, Makkai expresses adeptly, is what matters in a story.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Music for Wartime</em>, Rebecca Makkai’s impressive first collection of short stories follows two novels, <em>The Borrower</em> (2011) and <em>The Hundred-Year House</em> (2014). Makkai resides in her hometown of Chicago for most of the year, as well as in Vermont – writing, teaching, and caring for her two young daughters. Makkai’s short stories reflect aspects of her lifestyle: her narratives are descriptive and often intimate portraits of family, relationships, and children, and are united, as Makkai has said, by “artists of all stripes and their struggles.” This vision of the arts links past and present, and indirectly connects all her characters in a desire to communicate. In this collection, Makkai shows she is not afraid to take risks in creating nuanced portraits of a wide range of complex characters while maintaining a quasi-autobiographical undertone. Calling on her roots as a first-generation American citizen and child of immigrant parents, the author shapes a new American landscape that is still uncertain and rich with possibility, but peppered with relics of tradition and memories of ancestors.</p>
<p>Often playful and surreal, many of Makkai’s short stories are entertaining. In “The Worst You Ever Feel,” a young boy sneaks downstairs into his parents’ party where a famous violinist passionately performs. Although Makkai succeeds in creating a textured portrait of the violinist’s past in Romania, his “hair would have been wavy still, but black and thick, catching the light of the building’s scattered bulbs,” stories such as this do not require as much of the reader as others. It becomes something of a coming of age story for Aaron, where his understanding of the past changes in light of his first adult experience. He realizes he is not capable of experiencing divine revelations, but that the things he sees and feels are “common sense, floating for anyone to see.” “He lived here in America and now in the present,” and the things he perceives are flashes of his inherent, ancestral past, one that he cannot rebuild fully. Once the reader reaches the end and this conclusion, it seems there is little to entice further reflection.</p>
<p>One of Makkai’s greatest strengths is her ability to weave tradition and memory, both shared and personal into her stories. It is convenient that Makkai is the daughter of Hungarian immigrants, it provides her with fodder for her stories, and her experience and those of her ancestors serve as the building blocks for her literary landscape. Stories come back to back from different perspectives, and while at first this creates a sense of tension, the similarities between past and present, tradition and innovation, hope and destruction ultimately unite.</p>
<p>“The November Story,” about a reality TV producer and her deteriorating relationship with her girlfriend follows “The Worst You Ever Feel,” reinforcing themes of artistic struggle, and also telling stories of passion, lost and found, both in the not-so-distant past, and the present. Similarly, “The Briefcase,” the story about an escaped prisoner who impersonates a professor in order to survive as long as he can comes before “Peter Torrelli, Falling Apart,” which focuses on the friendship and lives of two gay men living in the Midwest. The contrast between the two stories is striking at first, one taking place in Eastern Europe during a time of oppression and one in modern-day America, but the commonality of the struggle against loneliness and the faltering in personal identity spin a traceable thread through the works. Makkai creates a new American landscape where seemingly opposing ideas crystallize in a new single structure.</p>
<p>Makkai’s “The November Story” might be one of the strongest in this collection. Although it follows similar veins of the tension between art and identity, as well as the power of what is left unsaid, the modern context and Makkai’s casual, sometimes sarcastic authorial voice work well in the circumstances of the story. “The November Story” also first showcases clearly the way Makkai treats romance throughout the book. She writes:</p>
<p>Eight days in, the producers tell us we need a romance arc. Kenneth says, “It has to be Leo and Astrid, because she’s the hottest girl, and he’s the only straight guy. We have to go hetero on this.” And then he says to me, “No offense, Christine, it’s the network, they’re asses. And they don’t get our demographic at all.”</p>
<p>Ines says, “You expect us to make them fall in love?”</p>
<p>He slurps his coffee through the lid and then looks at the ceiling.</p>
<p>“Yep.”</p>
<p>This passage reflects the modern struggle of production, in any kind of art, where the artist is responsible for his or her characters and must put them together in a way the situation demands.</p>
<p>Makkai also seems to create a “romance arc,” the journey of two individuals from strangers to lovers, throughout this book, although sometimes she struggles to do so. Her best stories focus on peculiar situations or language: forcing a relationship on the set of reality TV show, burying a dead elephant in a swimming pool, Johann Bach emerging from a piano. But when it comes to romance, it seems as though Makkai creates conflict with standard devices. Oftentimes it is distance, emotional or physical, or a circumstance like “he never called her beautiful,” that leads to the crumbling of a partnership. The “romance arc” between the stories seems somewhat tenuous and predictable, the unsurety and unpredictability of the love between Leo and Astrid, two of the show contestants in “The November Story,” redeems the romance plot of that story.</p>
<p>In her efforts to shape a new American landscape, Makkai selects modern themes such as homosexuality, pop culture, and terrorism and infuses them into many of her stories. However, by interspersing these vignettes into modern America with “legends” from her family mythology, she fragments her vision of America. In some ways, this supports an intriguing and even self-conscious portrait of herself as an artist and storyteller. She shares short family legends in order to reflect further on her own understanding of storytelling, and also reveals some sources of inspiration. The first story, “The Singing Women” introduces the possible intent of the author, to fulfill herself by preserving, “before its last breath, their culture.” In the context of the story, it is a male composer who wants to preserve the songs of his father’s people before they disappear altogether, and similarly Makkai memorializes her family and ancestry through her stories. “The Singing Women” ends with the sentence “I’ve lied and turned two women into three, because three is a fairytale number.” This notion of fairytale, magic, and mythology sets the stage for Makkai’s work to follow. Although the inclusion of mythic history in this book helps shape Makkai’s identity as an author and artist, sometimes the myths disturb the flow of the work on the whole and prevent a complete structuring of a new history.</p>
<p>Makkai creates a new American landscape through engagement with the peculiar both in modern and ancestral settings. However, this book, like a struggling artist, has moments that keep it from latching onto a single identity. Still, it makes sense for these stories to be grouped together, they should be, and they are stronger as a collection built on a foundation of artistry and memory than as any one individual might be. Though some of the fluidity of the book is disturbed by the changes between mythic past and surreal present, it does not seem entirely unintentional. When taken as a whole, <em>Music for Wartime</em> creates, as the name might suggest, a symphonic literary rendering of struggle and identity as an individual and artist.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/651/files/2015/11/morse.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-492" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/651/files/2015/11/morse-225x300.jpg" alt="morse" width="141" height="188" /></a>In <em>Void and Compensation</em> Michael Morse is fully engaged in turning his analytical intensity on the world, revealing the meticulous design and workings behind the simplest moments. The writing here, though thoughtful and layered, feels largely effortless. By peeling away the layers of language and craft, Morse seems to imply that even when we see the words unspool and the soundtrack crackle, even when we hear the conversation the next room over, some residue of the strange and notable remains.</p>
<p>Playing with overt emotion and, particularly, the relation of the life of the mind to the heart and sensuality, <em>Void and Compensation</em> obliges the reader to feel directly implicated in the longing found in these poems and to experience the separation they capture, as well.</p>
<p>The first step is all about obsession with exclusion,<br />
the cold front coming in and forcing you to hunker down,<br />
the migrants winging their way to some gold coast<br />
with enough fat in their chests to burn down a barn.</p>
<p>Isn’t your own heart that way from what or whom you can’t have?<br />
Wasn’t Sarah Vaughn singing this all along?</p>
<p>Polka dots and moonbeams, for sure, and that dress<br />
that loves your body suddenly put aside, and that touch</p>
<p>As “(Pug-Nosed Dream)” indicates, the lives here exist only to the degree that we are prepared to grant them “reality,” through the act of activating our empathy and intelligence. As the collection takes on the deceptions of the heart and of the senses it seems to come more alive in its accrual than in its individual parts. After all, the moments captured really matter primarily insofar as they come together for a given single orchestrated event.</p>
<p>In this, there’s something in <em>Void and Compensation</em> about both self-denial and missed chances; about the evolution of logic and emotion, or lack thereof; and about whether a given moment or gesture can ever be fully satisfying for either party, particularly if it’s misinterpreted, as in “(Assisted Living)”:</p>
<p>More has been said about<br />
how relationships don’t work</p>
<p>than about how they do.<br />
How do you?</p>
<p>I walk with my you in my head—<br />
Walkway and tow-away dovetail</p>
<p>In your skirts and farther in<br />
my head are heed not feelings.</p>
<p>As the collection progresses, further poems reveal more of the inner life of the complex speakers and characters, so it is, of course, about dark things floating to the surface of normality, as well.</p>
<p>The attunement of <em>Void and Compensation</em> to the most private human traits creates a context in which the awkwardness of life feels real, and close at hand, with one’s own ghosts flashing by in the mind’s eye as you read on. What makes this collection successful is, ironically, its mixture of different dramatic tones, and the way in which the poems fling us into the midst of action, seen from a slightly off-kilter angle, invoking a mood of melancholy and nostalgia, and delivering us to the heart of existential complexity.</p>
<p>What if you lived in a dark bed<br />
just outside a sacred house: what would you<br />
do for some caretaking, a bit of tending?<br />
Would you and your petals wait for rain,<br />
or would you simply wither yourself down,<br />
break yourself up until you were almost a shade<br />
and so desirous of resurrection you’d cry out<br />
for your winter bed of dead and dying leaves?<br />
“(Good Friday)”</p>
<p>And the little details Morse selects—the imposing questions, the personification, the withering, the desirousness, &amp;c.—to show the artifice of literature and much of our external lives are generally delightful. If Morse were being as earnest as poets writing of the natural world stereotypically are, the poems would fail to compel, entirely. Instead, in such poems, Morse brings out fundamental tensions between emotion, intellect, and perception via our separate ways of apprehending the world. If we allow ourselves to follow the poems and are willing to open ourselves to the conflicting emotional signals emitted by their often unexpectedly turbulent and ironic interactions we enjoy a compelling experience of the real difficulty in communication.</p>
<p>Morse’s emphasis on moments, gestures, and textures over plot means that at the most basic level <em>Void and Compensation</em> is a book about the limitations of language and of communication, suggesting, that language might be unnecessary, if not impotent, to some extent. As in “(Poem as Aporia between Lighthouses)” the collection is very much about the frustrations of interpretation.</p>
<p>A mother says to her child, in order to help him<br />
learn to do on his own, pretend I’m not here.</p>
<p>She says it when she’s tired of answering questions.<br />
She says it so that he might see his independence.</p>
<p>It is a crushing and cursory tutorial.<br />
It is his heart’s preparation for memory</p>
<p>Indeed, it is about interpretation of another’s words and actions in the light of what we hope was meant, and in the light of what they may have meant, or did in fact mean.</p>
<p>Morse’s attitude toward the cultural and economic changes affecting culture appears complex and ambivalent. While the evolution of technology, entertainment and politics may have opened up new ways of exploiting people and their emotions, Void and Compensation’s implicit political arguments are not Morse’s primary interest: his concerns are metaphysical and philosophical.</p>
<p>Fidelity investments: I have<br />
aggressive funds and little grin.</p>
<p>She who walks with me has no name on her back:<br />
free agent, are you betraying or betrayed?<br />
Are you obsessed with leaving or left out?<br />
(“(No “i” in Team)”)</p>
<p>Morse seems to insinuate that, in step with technology, and the commercial, morality, too, needs to evolve. Our inability to adapt to the new rhythms of life have resulted, the collection seems to imply, in a dangerous imbalance in our psychological and spiritual nature.</p>
<p><em>Void and Compensation</em> attempts to ground the condition of our modern existence in an experience of alienation amidst great emotional, psychological and ecological richness. The alienation in question is complex, and it is part of the poetry’s difficulty, but also its achieve¬ment and seriousness. On the one hand, the world being created is definitely beautiful: we see it in the sculptural lines generated by industry and the natural world, and in the poems which meaningfully register these complicated and contradictory states of feeling.</p>

		<title>ENTWINED: THREE LYRIC SEQUENCES (Tupelo Press) by Carol Frost</title>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Frost, Carol. <em>Entwined: Three Lyric Sequences</em>. North Adams, Massachusetts: Tupelo Press, 2014.</p>
<p>Reviewed by Philip Belcher</p>
<p>Two readily discernible emotions accompany the experience of reading for the first time a well-published poet of significant talent. First is embarrassment at not having read the poet long before this late discovery. The second is a sense of gratitude, combined with excitement at the prospect of spending more time, now that she is known to you, reading her ambitious and exquisite poems. The embarrassment passes, but the gratitude and excitement fold over time into lasting appreciation. Such is the experience of discovering Carol Frost through her latest volume of poetry, Entwined: Three Lyric Sequences.</p>
<p>Entwined opens with a prologue poem, “Lucifer in Florida” and ends with a prologue, “Man-of-War.” These poems do more than bookend the three sequences; they comment on the volume as a whole and provide a framework for a tightly constructed book of poems. Indeed, the very fact that the sequences work so well together is curious, given that the individual poems were written over a period of two decades. The poems of the second sequence were written first. The poems in the first and third sequences were written between 2003 and 2011, although the years do not overlap exactly. In a time when poems are often written as parts of a “project”—“here’s a topic; let me write poems about it”—it is interesting to consider how these poems written over such an extended period came to be joined in a single volume and how they fit so well.</p>
<p>In “Lucifer in Florida,” Lucifer introduces himself: he “ride[s] with darkness, dark below dark, uttermost / as when the cormorant dives and the fish dies, eye-deep / in hell; the bird is I, I hide in its black shining / spread of wings raised drying afterward on a tree bough.” (italics in original) Even in this rather ominous introduction, readers will notice Frost’s lyric sensibility; assonance is one of her musical talents. The repeated use of the first person singular “I” in this poem, too, may remind one of God’s reply to Moses’s inquiry into God’s identity in Exodus 3:14: “I am that I am.” Lucifer’s insistent description of himself, however, is countered by “Venus rising, the off chords and tender tones / of morning birds among the almonds, small flames / of lemon flowers, phosphorus on the ocean, / all I’ve scorned, all this lasts whether I leave or come.” This balance of Lucifer’s darkness and the beauty that nevertheless persists is reflected near the end of the poem in the speaker’s recognition of the proximity of chaos and order, death and life: “If the future is / a story of pandemonium, perfection’s close . . . .” And this serves well to introduce three sequences—each distinct in subject, form, and tone—that respectively address a lush tropical landscape, abstractions of human life and intelligence, and the slide from vitality toward dementia. Of Frost’s several fine accomplishments in this new volume, one of the most engaging is her organization of the book to show that the considerations of each of the sequences are not as distinct as one might at first expect, or want.</p>
<p>I Voyage to Black Point</p>
<p>Frost introduces the first sequence, Voyage to Black Point, with epigraphs from Dante and Baudelaire. Although her primary source for literary allusions throughout the sequence is Dante’s Inferno, readers insufficiently familiar with Dante or classical mythology will find the Notes following the poems both helpful and accessible. The poet sets the twenty-two poems in this first sequence in a tropical setting. Straightforward, often one-word titles—titles like “Sandpiper,” “Blue Crab,” “Redfish,” and “Low Tide”—make the settings clear but do little other work for the poems. Formally, two features stand out. First, Frost’s favorite mark of punctuation in Voyage to Black Point is the colon. Readers expecting to be put off by this will be surprised at how well it works. The colons moderate the reader’s pace through poems that often contain little other internal punctuation. Colons, and even more so double colons, slow the movement significantly but less finally than the occasional periods. This may seem a minor matter, but it is clear from the entire volume that Frost is not a poet who does anything in a poem by accident; every word and every mark are intentional. There is nothing extraneous, nothing wasted, nothing merely ornamental. Consider the effect of the colons in the first five lines of “Sandpiper”—how they guide the reader through the poem, showing her where to pause:</p>
<p>Pillar of salt then the spell reversed: vowels<br />
moistened in the mouth: tone of hurry::<br />
in the distance weird bubbling whistle<br />
bububu-hLeeyooo: Febru Febr-uary ooo:<br />
how it is to be that happy and afraid:</p>
<p>These lines also exhibit the second obvious structural feature of the first sequence—the uniform employment of single-line stanzas. The effect, again, is to slow the reader, but the space between stanzas also lends a feeling of sparseness to poems that otherwise implicate verdant natural scenes. This excerpt also shows another attribute of this poet: because she respects her readers, she feels free to make demands of them. Although the Notes are essential for most readers, they are not exhaustive; Frost expects her readers, particularly in this sequence, to grapple with narrative meaning. Thank goodness the poems can be read and enjoyed without the reader’s having to grasp each allusion, but sophisticated readers of poetry have an advantage. For example, one can no longer assume—if one ever could—that every reader will be familiar with the biblical story of Lot, but readers who remember the Genesis 19 story of the transformation of Lot’s wife into a pillar of salt when she disobediently looked over her shoulder at the destruction of Sodom will appreciate more deeply Frost’s depiction of the sandpiper in the first line—how it appears lifeless, like a pillar, until it whistles. The allusion invites a fuller appreciation of the poet’s appraisal of the bird’s change from inanimate object to musician, “how it is to be that happy and afraid:”.</p>
<p>“Manatee” offers another example both of Frost’s demands on the reader and the rewards of slow, multiple readings. The poet’s close attention to sound, her fondness for myth, and her ability to present a visceral image with great economy are all evident in the first six lines:</p>
<p>Shading to pink on the underparts: soft and liable<br />
to be mistaken for Sirens: how sea sound comes<br />
along the shore:: alone I found one shark-bitten deep<br />
in the pelvic muscle floating near a shoal: water almost calm<br />
light twinkling on oysters: fluting sweet shrill<br />
fleur-de-lys: the western baths of early evening: clouds::</p>
<p>The final five lines of the poem include narrative mystery (“how we’re saved from beauty beauty wanting // no other beauty but one::”), personal revelation about the speaker and her connection to the injured manatee (“my torn life myself surgeon-bitten::”), and a hint of Frost’s versatility with uncommon diction (“maculate flesh goldening as in a myth:: no more pretty songs”). The poet’s fondness for arcane diction also adds another dimension of complexity to these poems. In “Pelican,” for example, Frost uses “muting” to indicate a pelican’s defecating on a mangrove—the word doing extra duty through its multiple connotations.</p>
<p>II Abstractions</p>
<p>Critics often complain that contemporary poetry, at least American poetry written in the last half century, lacks ambition, although defining exactly what “ambition” is seems more problematic for them. Although he eventually punts and corrects himself by linking ambition to the poet instead of the poem, Donald Hall declared that one measure of ambition is the poem’s length. For many reasons, that seems inadequate and myopic, if not downright silly. Dickinson alone disproves Hall’s suggestions. (To be fair, Hall did seem to understand that brevity alone is not the determining factor; he qualified his statement by noting the ambition of some of Yeats’s shorter poems.) And I would add Carol Frost to any list of poets whose shorter poems are ambitious, if the definition includes attempting to address large issues with nuance, complexity of thought, and a high level of craft. In Entwined’s second sequence, Abstractions, Frost does just that. In these tight and pointed poems—most of them eleven lines long—Frost writes in a way that all poets want but few achieve: she writes with clarity, complexity, concision, and musicality.</p>
<p>The poems in this sequence are arranged alphabetically by titles that identify, in each instance, a single abstraction. There is something audacious about Frost’s willingness to name thirty-seven concepts and consider them effectively in poems shorter than a sonnet. Her success in doing so relies on two attributes evident in each of the poems in the sequence: an uncanny ability to illustrate the abstraction in question with an example that is both particular and broadly applicable; and an apparently boundless affection for beautiful and complex sentences.</p>
<p>Of the many fine poems in this sequence, “Horror” exemplifies Frost’s aesthetic achievement. In this ekphrastic poem, the poet uses Goya’s “Black Paintings,” particularly the one commonly known as “Goya’s Dog,” to show how the painter experienced dread. The subject is quite particular, but Frost draws the reader through the brief poem to a conclusion that makes a broader statement about the limited powers of art itself. In addition, the poem begins with an example of the poet’s syntactical dexterity:</p>
<p>When horror, that with pretty masks<br />
no longer stood to one side as he walked from his house to the garden,<br />
extolling neither the magic of the atmosphere nor medals he earned for painting,<br />
but undefinable, still deferred<br />
(as if somewhere a prophet had put down his hood and bellowed),<br />
grew colossal, Goya put fourteen black versions on his interior walls,<br />
the most audacious a dog whose trespasses have sunk him in an abstract grave.</p>
<p>Readers will appreciate the maneuvers in the opening clause from “When horror” to “grew colossal.” Describing the effect of a well-wrought sentence—making the case that a good sentence is more than an accumulation of words—Stanley Fish quotes from Anthony Burgess’s Enderby Outside (1968): “And the words slide into the slots ordained by syntax, and glitter as with atmospheric dust with those impurities which we call meaning.” Burgess’s description may be a bit overblown, but it does indicate something of the delight patient readers will discover in many of Frost’s poems, particular the sentences in the Abstractions sequence. Frost seems to be, as Fish quotes from Flaubert’s self-appraisal, “‘itching with sentences.’”</p>
<p>These poems are dense—not dense in the sense of being so tightly wound that the effort to unravel them seems unmerited (see, e.g., some of Geoffrey Hill) but in the sense that, in the space of (usually) eleven lines, the poet reveals something new about an abstraction to which nearly every reader will have devoted some thought. In “Apology,” Frost has the speaker recall an instance of passion—“someone held her a little roughly once in somber sweet groves”—in which the speaker succumbed to the advance. She now feels apologetic about the event, “as if a thorn catching her sweater has torn a small hole, —as if she shouldn’t / have worn the sweater.” What a simple, accurate, and devastating metaphor.</p>
<p>“Custom,” one of the many remarkable poems in this sequence, approaches the cliff of<br />
sentimentality and teeters there before turning away. In less talented hands, the poem would falter. Frost describes in a way readers will long remember the particular horrors of a bullfight:</p>
<p>As if it had forgotten everything—hatred, vindictiveness, the meaning of pain—<br />
the bull took the ribboned sticks in his back without response, turning away,<br />
so that when the picador entered the ring, the crowd was making fun<br />
of the country’s breeders. If there was an ounce of dignity or strength in the animal,<br />
the picador would have to find it with his pole, and he came on slowly<br />
to probe the back and shoulders:— cruelly, like a king with a scepter.</p>
<p>Frost then describes the tantrum thrown by the bull when it finally gives in to the taunting. After the bull is taken from the ring, the picador returns to the cheers of the crowd: “The assembly roared—by his actions they knew they knew better who they were.” No reader will finish this poem without reflecting about his own role as spectator of another’s pain.</p>
<p>III Apiary Poems</p>
<p>The thirty-two numbered but otherwise untitled poems in the third sequence are intensely personal in comparison to the poems in the first two sequences. Whereas Voyage to Black Point is characterized by careful attention to the tropical environment and Abstractions is concerned with a close interior examination, Apiary Poems addresses the dementia of the speaker’s mother. Poem 1, all of which is contained in a single set of parentheses, serves as a dedication “(For the ones / who line the corridors and sit / silent in wheelchairs / before the television with the volume off, / whose cares / are small and gray and infinite, / time as ever to be faced . . . .” In this poem, Frost emphasizes the personal nature of the entire sequence: “The last hour is a song or wound . . . / Except in this corridor—mother’s— / where finity’s brainless wind / blows ash, and ash again / blows through their cells: / So much silence, so little to say in the end.)”</p>
<p>Apiary Poems is not a sequence for readers impatient to find a resolution of the many issues raised by dementia. On second thought, perhaps that is exactly the audience for these poems. Frost is both tender and unrelentingly honest (although anger appears less frequently than one might expect). In poem 1, in which the poet introduces floral elements that reappear throughout the section, the first mention of a flower is in the brief description of a patient who “has drunk from the poppy-cup.” Even apparently benign things—flowers in a dementia ward—are not entirely beneficent. These poems repeatedly recall the vapor-thin character of the barrier between pandemonium and perfection forecast in the prologue poem, “Lucifer in Florida,” as when in poem 1 Frost describes how “carnations, wakeful violets, and lilies in vases— / masses of flowers—wrap / the urine-and-antiseptic air in lace . . . .”</p>
<p>Much of the beauty of the Apiary Poems arises from Frost’s incorporation of the extended metaphor of the economy of bees in her exploration of the mind and what it means to lose mental capacity and to experience that loss in another. Furthermore, the elements of musicality and concision so evident in the first two sequences of the volume are on full display again in this final section. The eleven-line poem 3 begins:</p>
<p>Abandoned bee boxes piled on each other at meadow end . . .<br />
Like clothing taken off,<br />
the bees who had alighted on hat,<br />
gloves, shirt, have flown off somewhere.<br />
Is it so terrible to outlive the mind?</p>
<p>This does seem to be a central question about dementia: Is outliving the mind better than having the mind remain fresh and aware of the failures of the rest of the body? The remainder of poem 3 expands on the question by listing examples of cognitive decline, summarizing the experience of dementia as “time running by like a small girl running by like a madwoman,” but the poet never answers the question, either here or in any of the Apiary Poems.</p>
<p>Frost does gamble a bit in this sequence; she takes the risk of writing as if she understands first-hand what it is like to lose one’s mental faculties. Although it is dangerous to assume that a poet’s clarity in writing about a subject means that the poet has actually experienced it, there seems to be little doubt that Frost has had personal experience with a family member’s dementia. If not, she should be congratulated for an imaginative tour-de-force. Yet, it is one thing to experience the dementia or any other malady of a close relative and quite another to experience it oneself. This is not to denigrate the suffering of the caregiver; that pain is real, severe, and well-documented. The risk Frost takes, however, is to write wearing the mask of the afflicted, and she does so with great effect and beauty. Mentioning the risk does not mean the risk is not worth taking. In poem 20, the speaker is the mother whose dementia is the subject of this sequence. One of the longer Apiary Poems, it begins with a list of warning signs of the speaker’s diminishing mental abilities, a list that grows progressively more threatening, until the horrific, but common: “Why did I find my skin’s / imperfections so interesting and pick off / moles?” The poem continues with an imagined or recounted description of what it is like for a person to know that she is losing herself:</p>
<p>For a little while I knew—there was a door,<br />
a split in the wall, and I was two persons,<br />
old and young, wise and clean, sturdy and<br />
bent, generous and dead. They were<br />
neck on neck like winter and spring<br />
but could do nothing for each other.<br />
I’m leaving, I know, each said,<br />
a flooding darkness in their eyes,<br />
a drawing down of blinds . . . .</p>
<p>Most of the poems in this sequence are single unbroken stanzas. Several, though, are broken into multiple stanzas and those, as might be expected, incorporate more noticeable traditional elements of form, particularly rhyme. Poem 9 works well as an example of this and other attributes of these elegant and elegiac poems. The poem’s first two stanzas recall the theory of honey’s origin as postulated by Pliny the Elder in the sequence’s epigraph. The third and final stanza incorporates line endings that rhyme or chime with end-words in the first two stanzas, effectively enacting the speaker’s declaration:</p>
<p>This, mother, is my song for you<br />
pretending to sleep with open eyes.<br />
As odor and dance lead bees to nectar,<br />
though you’re far away I will come to you.</p>
<p>The epilogue poem, “Man-of-War,” is a fine poem standing alone, but Frost, ever careful in structuring this volume, by placing it here returns the reader in a circular way to the prologue poem and the poems in the first sequence, Voyage to Black Point. The reader will find once again in “Man-of-War” descriptions of life in a tropical watery environment and will be directed through the poem again by an abundant use of colons as speed markers. The final six lines, though, are the most significant:</p>
<p>Clouds made wandering shadows:<br />
See and grasses mingled::<br />
There was no hell after all<br />
but a lull before it began over::<br />
flesh lying alone: then mating: a little spray of soul:<br />
and the grace of waves, of stars, and remotest isles.</p>
<p>The poet seems to be taking stock of all of the poems in the book and saying something about how they work together, from nature’s fecundity, to a person’s capacity to make sense of universal abstractions, to the eventual loss of physical and mental abilities—the turn toward death. And the poet’s conclusion is both heartening and sobering: life teeters between pandemonium and perfection and is eventually shadowed by the realization, like Lucifer’s, that the continuation of the cycle does not require our participation.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In <em>Biophili</em>a, his grand work on the stewardship of environment, Edward O. Wilson has famously said, “Humanity is exalted not because we are so far above other living creatures, but because knowing them well elevates the very concept of life.” Intrinsic to Brendan Galvin’s power and authority in his sixteen books of poetry across five decades is a generous sense of our common cause with the animal kingdom. <em>The Air’s Accomplices</em> takes us once again to Cape Cod with its topography, weather, flora and fauna; with its natives as well as the inevitable tourists. There he has made his home and found his home truths in the quotidian and the visionary, in the crossings between, the transactions. Witness the title of the volume’s concluding poem, “We Live in the Largesse of Our Nickle-Dime Moments.” There he says “The quotidian is no one’s birthright” to be taken for granted. We have to earn it, enter it by paying attention. Perhaps then it will flare into full meaning, dailiness given its due. Three-quarters of the poems are set on the outer reaches of the Cape, with most of the rest having to do, as in many of the earlier books, with Irish locales, history, and folkways. Across his publishing career Galvin has given his poems imaginative standing by means of an adaptive, enabling style characterized by breadth of tone, adroitness of metaphor, and astonishingly exact notation. No departure from that here. Skillfully balanced, these poems bring out grace and light without shorting the germinating darkness in nature and human behavior.</p>
<p>Brendan Galvin has taken his place among the meditative poet-walkers. His are slyly casual walks during which places become portals. He knows there’s a special signature in the mundane, that observing nature closely teaches relation, proportion, order, and an appreciation of mystery. In other words, to the right imagination nature instructs in poetics. Once again, Edward O. Wilson on “elevat[ing] the very concept of life.” In “Walking Will Solve It,” the speaker has taken to the river flats near the sea because “the bills, taxes / and toxins” of keeping up a house have made him feel he’s</p>
<blockquote><p><em>a man up there on a steel span<br />
over the river, painting each beam<br />
with a small brush, doing it all alone.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Gradually the walk brings a solution, however provisional. He recalls walking these dunes and finding</p>
<blockquote><p><em>a woman’s footprints, toes flawless, mild arch,<br />
heel slender, going side-by-side with a set of paws<br />
whose arrowhead shape and flat heel<br />
meant coyote.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Then the tracks of a blue heron are visible beside hers, calling up</p>
<blockquote><p><em>a Norse mapmaker’s sign for forest. Girl with Heron,<br />
Girl and Coyote, as in a myth like the Boy and<br />
the Dolphin.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Imaginative riffing before reason can interject itself. The day’s walk brings him back to the situation, the impasse, of the man on the bridge “who sooner or later has to begin again / where he started.” Repetition, but not unvarying, not stasis. The solution is that each outing is a new outing, and the only failure is to return unchanged.</p>
<p>“This Morning’s Pep Talk at Egg Island” contains advice that goes outward to the reader as well as inward to deal with daily quandaries in the speaker’s life. The hallmark objective of any walk is “To see things / as they are, keep your eyes open.” Deceptively simple, that, and it would be simplistic if not for the pressure the poet puts on “are.” Experiences are not single-celled. To all appearances they may be what they are literally, but they also can act as triggers for imaginative play, the past coexisting with the present, each modifying the other. As this poet of great empathy knows, the process of any alert walk is to enter if possible the other-than-human in order to more clearly understand what it means to be human. To go out to such creatures is to have them enter us. “Who do they think we are?” the poet asks in “Wild Guesses.” What set off the questioning?</p>
<blockquote><p><em>It took a crab bald as a baby<br />
to start it, stranded by<br />
low tide and studying me—<br />
What am I? It could never have seen<br />
anything like me upright<br />
on the sea’s floor. An unchildlike<br />
glow of assessment<br />
lit those eyes as it raised<br />
the whole carapace of its head.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The speaker is one who had “set out walking his route / and come to himself in a new place” (“Covey”). A dimensional self, for Galvin is no soft, blinkered pastoralist. Life in the context of death is a primary home truth.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Deliverer and undertaker, a full moon tide<br />
dropped the harbor seal on the flats,<br />
already thick with gasses</em></p></blockquote>
<p>begins “The Evidence of Four March Mornings.” On the second morning “a red gut pile / was extruded.” By day four</p>
<blockquote><p><em>the ribs were a ruddy basket.<br />
The skull was eye sockets and a mouth<br />
that recalled Munch’s <em>The Scream</em>.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>On the fourth morning all evidence was gone, the process of life ended yet on-going in the creatures that fed on the seal.</p>
<p>Giving a human voice to the unexpected has always interested Galvin. Nature is not subverted when the poet finds among creatures likenesses to ourselves. Metaphors can bind us to the natural order by perceived moral likeness. In his previous books, for example, we’d had words from weeds and from a well-tended garden. In this collection advice on poetry from spadefoot toads and from a beast of burden whose wonderfully evocative monologue “I Am the Donkey of Blind Raftery” begins with this matter-of-factness:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I lugged panniers of turf and scutched corn,<br />
hay on the hay-bogy, manure in a tip-cart,<br />
seaweed for mulching, practical loads all,<br />
but now this tramp poet sings<br />
in a failing tongue at my shoulder,<br />
leaning across me toward every<br />
ignorant ear on the roads of Galway.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Then the question, “Who were you expecting, Pegasus?” Put aside your preconceptions and listen, he tells the walker who has unintentionally gotten in his way. This is my dailiness. His name, he tells us, is Poteen Jack. “Look at me, shaggy and mean-mouthed / enough to support poetry.” Yes, tenor and vehicle. Art is where you find it, described in “Sprezzatura” as</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>                                                        the skill
and recklessness that releases grace,
a seemingly offhand act that conceals
the pains taken.</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>One of Galvin’s greatest assets has proven to be his arraying of urgent and reflective and emotive tones by means of the sound stream in a given poem, sculpted into lines and sentences. In this case, Poteen Jack’s gift for monologue.</p>
<p><em>The Air’s Accomplices</em> is a work of high ambition and matching accomplishment. How great our pleasure and instruction when Brendan Galvin brings us with him, imaginations at the ready, on an open-ended walk. In his company, to draw briefly from “Night Flight,” each of us may become “a welcome traveler of the synapses / between leaps of being.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Reprinted from Shenandoah Vol. 57, No. 2</em></p>
<p>No matter how much anyone wants to hear about it, I’m not going to discuss the night in Bill Dunlap’s Memphis studio when we started shooting at a panoramic photocollage of Mississippi hogs with a blowgun presented to Bill by Jim Dickey. Neither am I going to explain how we matriculated from a fried shrimp dive to a barbecue emporium and thence to the roof of a tall and gutted building where we were more vulnerable to both vertigo and the pelting rain than we had been on the neon-reflecting streets below, because if such a narrative is to unfold someday, it should be conveyed with troubling juxtapositions, high and low wit and rattling implications on rag paper or canvas with oils and the other materials that have served Mississippi’s grand chronicler, raconteur and art crusader Br’er Dunlap so well over the last three or four decades.</p>
<p>Bill was born in Houston, Mississippi in 1944, and so far as I can tell, he’s been reborn every day since. As he puts it, “I generally wake up of a morning thinking myself a painter and spend the balance of the day in my studio trying to prove it.” He’s been conjuring and executing his work in his native Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, northern Virginia and Florida at a blistering pace ever since, and I’ve succumbed to the evidence so long ago that anyone currently seeking an objective or restrained perspective on this matter need read no further.</p>
<p>Bill’s southern roots have provided his primary subject, though he’s branched out, as our cover suggests to blend the local and the global, the historical and the personal, the ironic and the romantic. If, as William Faulkner said, the past is not past, then the dead are not dead and the future is not only before us but with us. All of which I believe, else “grits ain’t groceries, eggs ain’t poultry and the Mona Lisa is a man,” as Titus Turner wrote it, Little Milton sang it and Bill would surely know it . In Dunlap’s paintings his own ancestors, Rembrandt, long-buried dogs, collapsed barns, fence lines, wild flora and fauna and a host of iconic artifacts take on a new life and speak to us. I don’t mean just me. His work has appeared in Harper’s, Esquire, Ontario Review, Vanity Fair, The Washington Post, arty magazines, dozens of museums, universities and galleries and on three previous covers of Shenandoah. Why? Because it is beautiful, witty, accessible, hungry, curious, ironic, beguiling, surprising and a little bit twisted. Because he summons so many beloved images, then subverts and scrambles them with counter-images and says Behold in a way that delights and threatens at the same time. “Hypothetical realism” he calls it in his high-octane honeyed bourbon voice. Inviting viewers to enjoy &#8212; as well as watch, wait, listen and think &#8212; he boldly approaches the comforting lure of nostalgia but swerves, winks and reminds viewers of the snelled hooks such delicious lures conceal. His beautiful Mississippi of the past, the old Shenandoah Valley and ridge farms of the Blue Ridge are all at once spellbinding and imbued with an awareness Flannery O’Connor expresses in Wise Blood:</p>
<p>Where you come from is gone; where you thought you were going to never was there, and where you are is no good unless you can get away from it.</p>
<p>But he also knows that the opposite is most likely equally true. And yet, he joyfully engages with both change and the resistance to it and is, in addition to being a disciplined and rigorous artist, an activist, archivist and grand panjandrum mischiefist who both celebrates and subverts the ceremonies and failures of his region, his country and his species (not limited to his fellow expatriates from the planet Mississippi). He can be found on panels, TV shows, openings, installations, classrooms, pig pickings and turkey shoots pushing art, praising art, interrogating art, all with a generosity of spirit Julia Reed calls “benevolent meddling.” His tactics are, of course, representation, but also reflection, refraction and deflection, all manner of distortion and a brand of yarning that is, for all its magpie gatheration, still pretty distinctly his own. His motifs include Rembrandt portraits, battlefields, wild animals (living and dead), arrows, farmsteads with fences, hounds (sad, sly, soulful or scolded), fish (as in “my mother is a”), water (coming, going or staying) delectable irises and other flora, vast landscapes and skyscapes &#8212; all charged and charmed by context and ingenious rendering. And colors? His purples are from Tyre, his blues from Robert Johnson, his yellows from Kashmiri saffron, and his browns, roans, buffs and ochers are out of the rich and riddling earth, his reds aortal and pomegranate and barnfire. And for all the beauty of his palette, he is threatening. Things and places (he is a priest of place) are vulnerable and under dangerous scrutiny, and we love them at our peril. Relics of the dead and sites of slaughter appear in juxtaposition to the most lulling viewsheds, and images of St. Sebastian and skulls crop up at the most inconvenient times. Ghosts wander about and beckon, but they do not simply disperse when we try to reason with them. Reversing the Hamlet practice, they interrogate us. As Barry Hannah has written, “Dunlap . . . put the hard-edge to the spooky and ineffable.”</p>
<p>And his canvases are big, and bigger. There’s an old back-yonder Delta tale about a marvelous, much-mourned dog. Seems a prideful countryman named Ratliff had only to step out on the porch holding up a plank the size of the raccoon whose meat he’d like in his kettle and skin he’d like stretched on the wall of his shed. Ratliff’s faithful hound Buster would take one look at the displayed plank and rush off, returning directly with a coon to fit the order. Unfortunately, one day Mr. Ratliff (or maybe it was Snopes or Gupton) had occasion to remove a broken door from its hinges, and he hauled it out onto the porch, where he was observed by a somewhat abashed Buster. The dog canted his head, sighed, whimpered and loped off toward the woods. Night fell, sun rose, stars again &#8212; no dog. Buster was never seen again. Dunlap, however, starts with the door-sized canvas (or paper, which he often paints, drops, smears and scumbles on) and expands from there. At least, that’s how I think he might make this point about scale and, maybe, ambition.</p>
<p>Early on, still hovering near the homeplace, Wild Bill demonstrated that he could offer up his own convincing version of the soul-razoring gaze of a Rembrandt self-portrait, rendering it with creepy accuracy, while interrogating product, process and the Master who produced it by hounding it or locating it at the center of a family reunion. He also painted his own family and environs with both deep fondness and a dead-serious irony, even then asking viewers to consider the cost of what we have and what we must lose in order to keep what we can’t bear to surrender. His 93 ½” long “Three Deer Head for Antietam” from 1982 presents a modern-day view of the battlefield site in winter, the upper two feet of the oil going from purple storm sky to burned butter to the thin rim of mountains, then hills, trees, nestled homes with one lonely martial monument, the whole vast marvel protecting both civilization and the profusion of the glorious from the foreground by only a frail fence, half toppled by the weight of snow (via <a style="text-decoration: none; color: #333;" href="http://www.dresshead.com/dresshead-staff-profile-joann-whiteside">Joann</a> at <a style="text-decoration: none; color: #333;" href="http://dresshead.com">http://www.dresshead.com</a>). What that foreground, the near hill, reveals are the disembodied heads of a trio of multi-branched mule bucks, their muzzles pointing toward the enticing viewshed, their severed necks showing gruesome meat and cartilage pointed right at the spectator. But you can’t just spectate, because these three sacrificed creatures with their thorny racks say, among other things, “Golgotha” and “suffering” and “cost.” And they ain’t whispering.</p>
<p>In 1984 when he painted one manifestation of his trademark horizontal intoxicating landscape with bristling, Luminist Revival light, stark trees, isolated farmstead in snow, migrating birds in the distance and misbehaving hunting dogs in the foreground, he called it “Agrarian Industrial Complex” and added a nuclear power plant emitting its gorgeous murderous smoke. No wonder the birds are leaving; no wonder three of the four dogs are looking out into the gallery to ask, “What do we do now?” while the fourth dog seeks a place to disappear.</p>
<p>Do now? Bill always seems to know, at least in some provisional way. He knows the bridge to take to the next thing, in various idioms, including conversation. I recollect one night when I was visiting him at his McLean studio, and we had sat up too late for safety naming the beasts of the forest and discussing how Miles Davis’s “Sketches of Spain” altered our auditory and visual imaginations forever. Though I’ve been a jackleg drummer off and on throughout my love affair with music, Bill was once the percussionist for Bill Whitsett’s Imperial Show Band and earned actual federal money at it. Seeing my experience, through no fault of his, as decidedly small change, I changed lanes and mentioned that I had some fine tomatoes in my garden, to which he replied that we should go to bed before the sun caught us, and we could greet the day joyously over some cathead biscuits and tomato gravy conjured from Mama Dunlap’s finest breakfast recipe. He was right about the need to sleep, and right about the biscuits slathered in gravy the hue of rosy-fingered dawn.</p>
<p>But sleep doesn’t seem to be one of his highest priorities, as Bill appears to be on the road or in the studio more hours per day than Timex puts on watches . It’s hard, looking at the proliferation of his oeuvre, not to think of the 18th century portraitist and polymath William Dunlap, who knew everything about the conventions of theater and not a little about paint. Though Willie Boy is more influenced by Church, Heade, Hopper, W. Homer, Rauschenberg, Wyeth and a heap of others than by the earlier Wm. (Roy Blount, Jr. says he “is to dog-trot what Cezanne was to the orange”), he knows as well as that long-gone W.D. that art is an event and life, as they used to say down at the Hollow Log Lounge, is an emergency.</p>
<p>An observer and commentator equally at home with Have Mercy in Darlington, S.C. and having coffee with maestro Gore Vidal on his piazza in Ravello, Dunlap is indeed “regional,” but not in the sense of gossip or local wines that won’t travel so much as in the sense of Islay scotch or scripture that are so specific as to be essential and must be allowed to stray where they may and will find advocates wherever they arrive and pause. Although a few titles of his paintings won’t make you cock your ears or raise your hackles &#8212; say “Objects Found and Fashioned,” “Landscape and Variable,” “Birds of a Feather,” “Mississippi Painting” &#8212; others say “enter at your own risk”: “Vitruvian Bear,” “Three Deer Head for Antietam,” “Rose Red Root Rut Run,” “He’ll Set Your Fields Afire,” “Delta Dog Trot, Landscape Askew”; “Rembrandt and Spook, Narcissus Reflects on the Starnes House as Audubon’s Osprey Flies Away.” How can anybody resist thinking, “I’d like to have a chance to look at those”?</p>
<p>ONE DAY THE mailman brought me a cardboard tube of the sort posters are shipped in, but I could hear something rattling inside as I tipped it, and the return address let me know it would be some sort of art. Inside, I found a hand-made arrow &#8212; fletched, nocked, paint-banded and chert-tipped with a hide strip lashing the point. “What on earth?” Today I might think some terrorist had turned strange, but then I just thought: “We’ll see.” The next paintings I saw by Bill featured various versions of an arrow-riddled corpse. Some would think of the body Costner/Dunbar and his mule driver in “Dances with Wolves” find on the prairie, as the teamster says somebody back home’s wondering, “Why don’t he write?” Others will envision Saint Sebastian, and a few (I wasn’t one yet) might say something akin to, “Aha, Sergeant Wylliams, a photo-documented casualty of manifest destiny’s miscalculations.” Bill means “all of the above,” and some version of that sad human pincushion appears in works like “Willing Spirit, Weak Flesh,” “Meditations on the Origins of Agriculture in America,” “Deer Hide Willow Seek,” “Indian Paint Brush” and others. Bill has written that the picture of the dead soldier remains “the most indelible image” for him, and as I perused these paintings and constructions, all the while that little “look out!” voice in my head was saying “and blowgun darts, too.”</p>
<p>Percussionist and projectile, evangelist (his step-daddy was called) and shill, pilgrim and curator &#8212; Dunlap believes in full immersion in both illusion and indelible, undeniable fact, and among the great messages in his work are that still life is not nature mort so much as a haunted pause in the wrestling match between refreshment and decay, that the South (with its high theater, low cunning and Christ-hauntedness) is a beautiful, dangerous place to live out the human experiment, that “good hand, good eye” is not enough or beside the point: technique is the mule, not the freight (but it is the mule!). And those dogs who seem to be looking for something (perhaps an earlier cannier race of master/comrades than we have proved to be) won’t let me forget Bill’s humor, which can be deft or sledge-hammer, as he’s not only witty in a traveled, astute and cunning way, but also hunker-down, knee-slap funny, full of puns &#8212; visual and verbal &#8212; exaggerations, wild associations and the sense that “anachronism” is just another way to say “anything goes.”</p>
<p>IN THE NEWER paintings (“Bull Barn Storm” and “What Boys Paint”) Dunlap revives and levitates some vintage warplanes to fly over Americana, then conducts both obsolete and state-of-the-art martial paraphernalia, complete with infantrymen, in a symphonic conflagration in which more goes on than barnstorming: explosions bloom in demonic shapes, a palm-studded country suffers and anonymous foot soldiers puzzle over gigantic saurian rough beasts slouching across the desert. Are these Iraqi crocs or our own Everglades gators, drafted for some new surge strategy? Maybe it doesn’t matter. In this painting not quite so long as a coffin, we feel shadows of the military cycloramas of Atlanta and Gettysburg (and the Depression mural revival) Dunlap has long admired and studied. This much we know: SOMEBODY is bringing the recent history of western military prowess to bear, with extreme prejudice, on a city and its surround. Spectators get to see the destruction from a protected distance, and the blood is hidden from us, but we know what colors these “boys” paint in, and who supplies the pigment by pints and gouts. Even the birds we have savored in previous Dunlap “productions” (the narrative is often so John-Ford cinematic that the word seems apt) signal that this crucible is, at best, a place to be from. Given the content of the daily news, his imagery here is hardly prophetic, but it is a grande pathetique, bringing some of the horror home, just in case anyone has forgotten the early months when vengeful might seemed to some enthusiasts beautiful in a para-testeronic way. Those gung-ho’s probably won’t like the ways he’s suggested their Great Adventure is, at best, opera buffo, but from the start “Shock and Awe” is a phrase born to describe a disaster, no matter how much glamour is mustered.</p>
<p>BROTHER DAVE GARDNER observed, upon seeing one of those road construction signs warning BE PREPARED TO STOP: If you wasn’t prepared to stop, dear hearts, you ought not to of started out. So I’m going to have to hit the brakes myself, though readers needn’t. What we offer in our portfolio is but a smattering of the blessed madness, but I want everyone to know that there’s more, much more.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I could get up from this kitchen table, I think,<br />
and go see for myself whether, even how,<br />
in the worn planks of the old barn floor<br />
there might still be the two holes I saw made there<br />
forty years ago, in a single second along<br />
the ponderous time-line of farming. Well,</p>
<p>I might get over there one of these days.<br />
Meanwhile, what can I see from here? We entered<br />
the barns second story through a big sliding door<br />
at the top of an earthen ramp. There was a haymow<br />
on either side of a wagon-wide aisle -way.<br />
A rail under the ridgepole ran gable to gable.</p>
<p>High in a dark far end, when I was a boy,<br />
the old hayfork still hung there barely visible<br />
in cobwebs and thin strips of sunlight<br />
that burst between weathering boards. Shaped<br />
like a three-foot inverted U, a giant staple,<br />
it rusted toward absolute darkness against which</p>
<p>stark blobs left by last season’s mud was<br />
stood out like white spots on a heifer.</p>
<p>Who knew how long it had been there? Loose hay<br />
was giving way to bales before I was born,<br />
though here and there I’ve seen it made, the teams<br />
of work-horses pulling the loader and wagon,</p>
<p>a man with a pitchfork working everyday magic<br />
on top of the rack, the slow ride to the barn,<br />
drawing the load up under the rail and the trip-stop.<br />
A man dragged the fork down, hauling against<br />
the two-rope’s weight the forty punts of steel<br />
with two barbed ends that grabbed the wads of hay.</p>
<p>Then the team, unhitched from the wagon, pulled<br />
on the two-rope, moving away from the bard,<br />
lifting the hay toward the roof. A click<br />
as the trolley-hook caught, then the hay<br />
rode back along the rail into the mow<br />
where men forked it away for the winter.</p>
<p>So to a day when I was twelve or thirteen,<br />
when the baled hay we were making was plentiful,<br />
stacked in the mow almost up to the roof,<br />
and we were standing around in the aisle-way<br />
after the wagon backed out, catching breath,<br />
getting ready to go back to the field. One man</p>
<p>up in the mow took a notion and snatched<br />
at the tag-end of rope twill fastened to the hayfork,<br />
so it whirred down the track to a place just above<br />
the middle of the aisle-way, hit the tripe, and dropped,<br />
all faster, it seemed then the noise of the track<br />
could make us look up, and plunged its two points</p>
<p>into the floor just beside the left foot of Joe Trammel,<br />
who stood there, leaning away from it, looking down<br />
and then up, and round at all of us, a barnful<br />
of men struck reverently silent in the presence of<br />
whatever it was, the good luck that kept Joe<br />
from injury, the bad luck that gave him his worst scare</p>
<p>in years, the innocent thoughtlessness that led<br />
to that heat yank on the rope, the way things can go<br />
for years without happening, biding their time<br />
in a dust-whirling, cobwebby barn I can see<br />
and smell and hear right now, staring down<br />
at the grain in the wood of this kitchen table.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>September, 1926, clear</em></p>
<p>He had before come courting – with pecans<br />
or peaches, berries. She had those times been able<br />
to thank him with one of her pies and be<br />
done with him. For this, though, he would want<br />
supper, to sit at the table with her<br />
after supper. For this, she reckoned he had<br />
spent most of the morning emptying<br />
the sky of its plenty: the doves spilled from<br />
burlap in iridescent disarray,<br />
three dozen at least, a shimmering</p>
<p>bouquet. And so the afternoon was for her<br />
defined; the hour deepened the mound of feathers,<br />
blue-grey, plucked in porch-dusk, and the wind,<br />
disinterested, would once in a while stir them.<br />
She knew they were easy to bring down<br />
over a field where they would fall into<br />
the tangled grasses and go on on flying against<br />
what had been wind. Easy – as this was not:<br />
feet, gut, heart, the smooth brow with eyes open<br />
like garnets glowing; she cut and tossed over</p>
<p>and over what was in the end useless<br />
onto the feathers, a last and bloody bed<br />
or to the cats, who growled and circled her,<br />
to keep the peace. A dove would amount to,<br />
at best, a half-dozen mouthfuls, the dark<br />
breast tender but grizzled with shot – black seed.<br />
She threw a whole bird to the nursing cat<br />
and wondered whether the white kitten had opened<br />
its eyes; if they were blue, it would be deaf,<br />
she had been told and told she could not let it</p>
<p>live. She would see about that. Her mother called down<br />
how are they coming. More work than they’re worth,<br />
she answered back, for such a little meat.<br />
Even with the birds still baking, yet to be<br />
eaten, with still the biscuits to stir up<br />
and gravy yet to make from the meager fat –<br />
with a strait hour to pass before he would<br />
lean back from the table to pick his teeth and sigh –<br />
she had decided he should have left the doves<br />
their beloved sky, for she would not be won.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/651/files/2015/10/opposite.jpg" alt="" align="right" />Everything is Lost: Review of <em>The Opposite House: Poems</em> by Claudia Emerson, Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 2015.</p>
<p>Claudia Emerson’s new collection <em>The Opposite House</em>, published posthumously by LSU Press, confirms and expands her identity as a poet of loss. Ever since her first book, <em>Pharaoh, Pharaoh</em> (1997), also from LSU, Emerson has explored what the writer of the blurb on the back of that volume called “the irony of loss.” With <em>The Opposite House</em>, however, she takes that “meditation” to a whole other level: Everything is lost. The central problem&#8211;for all of us, really&#8211;is what our responses to this inescapable fact will be, can be.</p>
<p>The volume itself is a marker of loss for all of us who love poetry, who have enjoyed her body of work, because Emerson died of cancer in 2014. The awareness that she must have been crafting these poems while facing her own death adds another level of poignancy to the reading.</p>
<p>Does her death make the poetry better? Of course not. But perhaps it adds another dimension to the array of loss the book so thoroughly explores. And her poetry needs no artificial boost; it is clear-sighted, far-reaching, disturbing, and at times painfully honest, at others humorous. <em>The Opposite House</em> is the most ambitious, most fully realized of Emerson’s books (and I say that even while celebrating her 2006 Pulitzer Prize-winning <em>The Late Wife</em> and looking forward to the just released <em>Impossible Bottle</em>). <em>The Opposite House</em> expands and deepens the intertwined themes she has dealt with from the start of her career: how loss (of so many kinds) shapes our identities&#8211;as individuals (even before we are born), as members of a family, as participants in communities&#8211;local, regional, national, and even cultural. Emerson gives us portraits of people from her world, a Southern, rural, working-class world that is changing faster than the inhabitants can understand&#8211;in other words, people like us even if we are not Southern or rural or working-class. Our heritage is always already gone, our birthright is sold for a mess of porridge, our houses fall down, our ways of life disappear, our food rots in the grocery store, we live by killing&#8211;animals and trees and one another, we wear masks to try to hide our true selves, our loved ones die&#8211;often in ways that lose them to us and us to them before their bodies finally stop, our body parts fail, and then we die, some holding on to one last fragment of a true moment, some leaping from the window because even a new-born child is not enough of an answer to how and why to keep facing a world full of “gravity, [and]&#8230; language, [and]&#8230; despair.” In the face of all this loss, Emerson also portrays the spectrum of our responses&#8211;curiosity, bitterness (these from the first stanza of the opening poem in Emerson’s first book), grief, anger, denial, acceptance, and, most frightening, the final word of <em>The Opposite House</em>, despair. I am tempted to see despair as Emerson’s final word on the subject. In a sense, how could it not be for all of us? In Margaret Atwood’s words: “Don&#8217;t be deluded by any other endings, they&#8217;re all fake” (“Happy Endings”).</p>
<p>The first section of <em>The Opposite House</em> is a catalog of the personal losses we see for those around us suffering. Emerson is, first, an unblinking observer of the world she embodies in her poems, often literally through the stories of individuals losing the world piece by piece through the failure of their own bodies. The section, to borrow the title of one poem, focuses on “Charting the Particulars” of so many kinds of loss. In that poem, a man who lost his leg fifty years earlier must acclimate himself every day to the fact that “the brain has never accepted it / and still sends down the most ludicrous / of commands, an itch on the missing shin, tickle / on the arch of a foot….” Emerson knows the psychology of facing the “unacceptable,” but she then ups the ante ten-fold by an associative leap: the artificial limb,</p>
<blockquote><p><em>… the thing that leans<br />
in the corner by the bed, …<br />
… reminds him of one of his children newborn,<br />
before he had reason to dislike it. </em></p>
<p>He knew,<br />
of course, that it was his, but he found it alien<br />
anyway—</p></blockquote>
<p>Suddenly the poem not only charts particulars of the man’s life dealing with a lost limb but also the more universal mystery that in so many ways the brain can never accept or even fully understand not only our losses but the myriad realities of our lives and our closest relationships.</p>
<p>In “Torch,” Emerson gives us another individual’s catalog of loss, in this case a German immigrant wife losing her life bit by bit in a horrible cascade due to a brain tumor:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The tumor was pressed deep into the brain’s<br />
left hemisphere, unreachable, like most<br />
of what she thought she had forgotten or stored<br />
reasonable away—the children’s things,<br />
the years of the war, her youth, what she felt<br />
about any of it.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The woman’s life is serially stripped away: first, actual things, then the memories of the past, then her own youth, and then, most terrible of all, her emotions. Later in the poem</p>
<blockquote><p><em>her granddaughter disappeared<br />
into someone she had never seen before.<br />
She did not know her daughter. Speech<br />
faded away; The English she learned late<br />
left first.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>And, then, after</p>
<blockquote><p><em>A few more weeks, …<br />
when those first, lingering words dissolved, she nodded,<br />
sometimes, as though she understood:</em></p></blockquote>
<p>What does she understand? She has lost all language; she has lost not only her family, not only the outside world, but her self and the tools with which to interact with the world. The poem’s close takes her back to a picture of the specific moment during a blackout in World War II when she meets “the man who will be the father / of her unimagined children” and he whispers to her to switch off the flashlight she has forgotten in her pocket. In that moment she understands the only thing left to her is to turn out the light—“and so she will.” At this point is death even a loss? Perhaps this ending is not exactly despair (the woman has lost even the emotions that could cause despair), but what about us? What is left to us sharing in the progressive losses the book as a whole charts?</p>
<p>The second section of the book is a brief collection of “Early Elegies,” eight poems, each eight lines long, lamenting the loss of once familiar things in our culture. Here, Emerson shifts our focus and our sense of loss from individual and relational losses to specific examples of how loss is part of cultural evolution. Emerson’s title names these poems “elegies,” typically poems of lament or mourning, and most of these (“Cursive,” “Barber,” “Operator,” “Drive-In Movie Theater”) do speak in a tone of loss. Not tragic loss, as in section one, but more along the lines of: look at these “exemplar” things disappearing before our eyes; notice that they are being lost, like it or not. Not all cultural loss is equal, though, and Emerson also shows that truth. “Wisdom Teeth” and “Smallpox” close the section and must at least hint that not all loss is really loss in the same vein.</p>
<p>So we come to the third section of <em>The Opposite House</em>. Emerson’s work often offers very dark view indeed. But Emerson’s career, and especially this volume, also serves to embody another response (beyond despair? despite despair?): we pick up salvageable pieces from the ruins all around us and make new uses of them. In the poem that shares its title with the volume, the “opposite house” is not that of the Emily Dickinson poem Emerson uses as the book’s epigraph:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>There’s been a death, in the Opposite House,<br />
As lately as Today&#8211;<br />
I know it, by the numb look<br />
Such Houses have&#8211;alway—</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Dickinson’s lines show the way the fact of death colors how we, across the street, see the house, the world. Emerson’s title poem, like Dickinson’s, makes the place embody loss, or, more exactly, the way we see loss, but in Emerson the opposite house is “opposite” to Dickinson’s in that it is “a cavernous warehouse / of houses / dismantled, / cataloged, / reordered.” The bones of old houses are gathered for sale, for reuse in a new world. Imagine the suburban professional clientele drooling over weathered barn siding, the “aged, / orphaned &#8212; / artifacts of the / slower fires / of neglect, / abandonment,” now to be a stylish effect in the living room of a McMansion:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><br />
like<br />
prizing gold<br />
from the teeth<br />
of the dead, to be<br />
re-measured, leveled<br />
grafted as though<br />
re-made into<br />
the agelessness<br />
of someone else’s<br />
household-now<br />
</em></p></blockquote>
<p>If we are blind, we make art of the painted glass eye that cannot see but makes the empty socket more palatable to “the whole-sighted world.” In “The Ocularist,” Emerson gives us the voice of a maker of such artificial eyes:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><br />
One of the earliest<br />
eyes was found<br />
with the ancient<br />
corpse of a woman<br />
in Persia, hers<br />
made of gold<br />
to resemble<br />
a small sun&#8211;<br />
iris and sclera<br />
chased rays&#8211;<br />
clear testament<br />
not to the eye,<br />
but to the light<br />
that had been<br />
made go out.<br />
</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Later in the poem, the ocularist makes a claim that can stand for Emerson’s work, too, and which perhaps offers us one kind of hope even in the shadow of despair:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><br />
So I aligned<br />
the gaze<br />
for the whole-sighted<br />
world, that<br />
it might find<br />
some small fragment<br />
of itself<br />
contained there, already in<br />
the brain&#8211;<br />
I could make it<br />
believe&#8211;the fact<br />
of what was<br />
not there of no<br />
matter at all,<br />
the final<br />
measure of an eye’s<br />
worth, in fact<br />
its complete<br />
disappearance&#8211;<br />
and with it,<br />
mine&#8211;into<br />
the opposite<br />
eye that was<br />
such belief.<br />
</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Such an ambition, to spend a life crafting an art(ificial) response to the inescapable varieties of loss that come to all mortal bodies that somehow becomes “worth” more than what has been lost.</p>
<p>In this third section, Emerson’s portraits explore a variety of making-new-out-of-old stories, of seeking salvage from the omnipresent decay at the crux of life: house sparrows, trapped inside JFK’s international terminal, not only adapt to a totally foreign world but “become the only natives / of this place, everyone else transient”; a prosthetic limb factory serves to question the relationship between made things and natural born; a rural mail carrier, whose job is increasingly irrelevant in the new age of email and online bill paying, keeps going against the imagined day he delivers “the letter addressed in a hand so far away, / so familiar, it would need no other understanding, / having found in me its last and only way”; and even salvage from the space shuttle Challenger’s explosion:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>                                                Something<br />
did survive the fire, though, the fall, some<br />
small canistered experiment involving<br />
free-living creatures thin as eyelashes<br />
recovered alongside a severed hand<br />
still gloved, head helmeted; a form the size<br />
of a comma was let to fall to that violent<br />
reversal of the garden, unharmed….</em></p></blockquote>
<p>To ask if these reclamations are enough is human; it is a question that drives so many of our responses of disbelief and bitterness; but it is also futile. That is the power of this collection. Emerson shows us ourselves without judgement and without flinching. She searches through the debris of the ever-changing world for the life that will go on, however changed, despite the fact that each of us will be, like the “astronauts [,] &#8230; scattered / piecemeal all over the Big Thicket.”</p>
