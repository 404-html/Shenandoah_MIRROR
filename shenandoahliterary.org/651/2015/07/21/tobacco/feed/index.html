					<description><![CDATA[I love this poem for its simplicity and its subtle portrait of a hardened grandmother. The image of a mouthful of tobacco &quot;ripe as/wild plums&quot; suggests a sort of innocent pleasure to the grandmother&#039;s bad habit, and further convey some kind of youthfulness in her that is furthered in the line, &quot;she’ll live longer’n/you or me.&quot; This contrasts with her apparent solitude, and the fact that she &quot;won&#039;t say doodley-/squat.&quot; Wise and seemingly steadfast in her ways, the grandmother represents an insurmountable force and fixture in the life of the narrator. Even though the final line presents a dark, even malicious tone, it is apparent that the grandmother is sturdy like a cow, and resists both human interaction as well as deterioration by maintaining her stringent ways.]]></description>
