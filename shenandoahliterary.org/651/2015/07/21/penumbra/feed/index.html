					<description><![CDATA[I always enjoy Betty Addock&#039;s poems, and, not surprisingly, Penumbra is excellent.  Though not directly, but tangentially, Penumbra reminds me of John Crowe Ransom&#039;s &quot;Janet Waking.&quot;  Both poems are devastating and beautiful.  

Janet Waking 

Beautifully Janet slept
Till it was deeply morning. She woke then   
And thought about her dainty-feathered hen,   
To see how it had kept.

One kiss she gave her mother,
Only a small one gave she to her daddy
Who would have kissed each curl of his shining baby;   
No kiss at all for her brother.

“Old Chucky, Old Chucky!” she cried,   
Running across the world upon the grass   
To Chucky’s house, and listening. But alas,   
Her Chucky had died.

It was a transmogrifying bee
Came droning down on Chucky’s old bald head
And sat and put the poison. It scarcely bled,   
But how exceedingly

And purply did the knot
Swell with the venom and communicate
Its rigour! Now the poor comb stood up straight
But Chucky did not.

So there was Janet
Kneeling on the wet grass, crying her brown hen   
(Translated far beyond the daughters of men)   
To rise and walk upon it.

And weeping fast as she had breath
Janet implored us, “Wake her from her sleep!”   
And would not be instructed in how deep   
Was the forgetful kingdom of death.
