					<description><![CDATA[This brief piece works quickly to make its reader inwardly nervous about what the author calls &quot;the human eye&quot;. Much of the story treats the tiger as the denizens of Paris do; that is to say, as a metaphorical rather than a literal one. Despite the actual physical danger threatened by a live tiger stalking the streets of Paris, the city&#039;s inhabitants are much more concerned about its symbolic significance. As they get caught up in philosophical musings about what the tiger represents, to too does the reader lose sight of its &quot;razor claws and horrific fangs&quot;. When the author points out the outlandishness of the citizens&#039; reactions, the reader find himself reproved right alongside the Parisians.]]></description>
