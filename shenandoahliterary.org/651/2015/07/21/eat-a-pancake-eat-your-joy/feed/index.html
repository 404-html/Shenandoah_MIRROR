					<description><![CDATA[One thing I&#039;ve always loved about flash fiction: it gets right to the heart of things. This requires extra care on the part of the author to create scenes and characters in a much shorter amount of time. My favorite part of this story was how quickly I got a vivid sense of the barrenness of that Las Vegas bus stop and the protagonist&#039;s situation, especially when compared to the warmth and possibility embodied by Selena and her pancakes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed the pithy and poetic writing style in this story. I also really loved Selena&#039;s characterization--she is ethereal and elusive but I could still somehow picture her vividly. The main character&#039;s relationship with her was also interesting; she acted as a loving mentor, but there was also a hint of abandonment and some sort of emotional wall in their friendship, and the main character steals her money. Finally, I loved the setting of this story--an IHOP in the middle of nowhere somewhere in the American Southwest fit the jaded yet inspired tone of this story well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a really fun short, short story. As I read it I&#039;m reminded of the poetic form, especially given the quick, big hitting sentences and little paragraphs. Unlike many stories, we are immediately placed directly into an unusual scenario and are offered only enough context later on to make some sense of the events that transpire. The air of curiosity serves an IHOP storyline well. I won&#039;t soon forget: &quot;Pancakes of everything, of everything pancakes.&quot;]]></description>
