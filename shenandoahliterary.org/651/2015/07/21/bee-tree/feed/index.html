					<description><![CDATA[Hankla expands upon an image often explored in poetry--the beehive. She creates a tension between what&#039;s natural and artificial that surfaces throughout the poem. Her concern that this hive, housed in a gnarled trunk, might be the &quot;last bee tree / in a food chain of cultivated / colonies&quot; speaks to the modern fright about these dying insects and the fad of home apiaries. Furthermore, her allusions to space, planets and comets, and also Greek mythology add a quizzical depth and drench her final stanzas in a surreal tone.]]></description>
