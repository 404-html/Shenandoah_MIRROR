					<description><![CDATA[I find this story fascinating and complex, and rich with wonder. I find a nearly science fictional element to this story, a woman becoming impregnated by the cosmos, combined with a mythological undertone  - a suggestion on the birth of stars. The star, when it emerges from Rachel, is described as some sort of hideous alien creature, and yet Rachel has every desire to love it. I wonder at what was growing inside her as far as her husband was concerned, is she incapable of having children - but determined to give something to the universe? This story encouraged melancholy, and made me think not only about what makes us human, but how we interact with our universe and whether after all it gives us, if we can give anything back.]]></description>
