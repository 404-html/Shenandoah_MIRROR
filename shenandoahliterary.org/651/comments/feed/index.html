					<description><![CDATA[I always enjoy Betty Addock&#039;s poems, and, not surprisingly, Penumbra is excellent.  Though not directly, but tangentially, Penumbra reminds me of John Crowe Ransom&#039;s &quot;Janet Waking.&quot;  Both poems are devastating and beautiful.  

Janet Waking 

Beautifully Janet slept
Till it was deeply morning. She woke then   
And thought about her dainty-feathered hen,   
To see how it had kept.

One kiss she gave her mother,
Only a small one gave she to her daddy
Who would have kissed each curl of his shining baby;   
No kiss at all for her brother.

“Old Chucky, Old Chucky!” she cried,   
Running across the world upon the grass   
To Chucky’s house, and listening. But alas,   
Her Chucky had died.

It was a transmogrifying bee
Came droning down on Chucky’s old bald head
And sat and put the poison. It scarcely bled,   
But how exceedingly

And purply did the knot
Swell with the venom and communicate
Its rigour! Now the poor comb stood up straight
But Chucky did not.

So there was Janet
Kneeling on the wet grass, crying her brown hen   
(Translated far beyond the daughters of men)   
To rise and walk upon it.

And weeping fast as she had breath
Janet implored us, “Wake her from her sleep!”   
And would not be instructed in how deep   
Was the forgetful kingdom of death.

					<description><![CDATA[This brief piece works quickly to make its reader inwardly nervous about what the author calls &quot;the human eye&quot;. Much of the story treats the tiger as the denizens of Paris do; that is to say, as a metaphorical rather than a literal one. Despite the actual physical danger threatened by a live tiger stalking the streets of Paris, the city&#039;s inhabitants are much more concerned about its symbolic significance. As they get caught up in philosophical musings about what the tiger represents, to too does the reader lose sight of its &quot;razor claws and horrific fangs&quot;. When the author points out the outlandishness of the citizens&#039; reactions, the reader find himself reproved right alongside the Parisians.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Kooser is extremely aware of sound in the poem. His alliteration, consonance, and onomatopoeia allow the reader to easily slide into the scene of the poem, as if on the slick ice ourselves. The kinesthetic energy captured in his active language  deftly traces the woman&#039;s movement and, in a flashing smile, the response her internal transformation. I love Kooser&#039;s ability to describe what must be a few seconds in time so colorfully and clearly.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hankla expands upon an image often explored in poetry--the beehive. She creates a tension between what&#039;s natural and artificial that surfaces throughout the poem. Her concern that this hive, housed in a gnarled trunk, might be the &quot;last bee tree / in a food chain of cultivated / colonies&quot; speaks to the modern fright about these dying insects and the fad of home apiaries. Furthermore, her allusions to space, planets and comets, and also Greek mythology add a quizzical depth and drench her final stanzas in a surreal tone.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One thing I&#039;ve always loved about flash fiction: it gets right to the heart of things. This requires extra care on the part of the author to create scenes and characters in a much shorter amount of time. My favorite part of this story was how quickly I got a vivid sense of the barrenness of that Las Vegas bus stop and the protagonist&#039;s situation, especially when compared to the warmth and possibility embodied by Selena and her pancakes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed the pithy and poetic writing style in this story. I also really loved Selena&#039;s characterization--she is ethereal and elusive but I could still somehow picture her vividly. The main character&#039;s relationship with her was also interesting; she acted as a loving mentor, but there was also a hint of abandonment and some sort of emotional wall in their friendship, and the main character steals her money. Finally, I loved the setting of this story--an IHOP in the middle of nowhere somewhere in the American Southwest fit the jaded yet inspired tone of this story well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a powerful story that illustrates how we can extract happiness and wonder from the mundane moments in life. The ending is especially impactful, and the last line was a shock to the system. I also wonder what the significance of only mentioning Gabrielle by name throughout the story, even though David is in the title. I was most intrigued by the subset of the story titled &quot;A house in the country.&quot; The insight about the dog and his chain serves as a great metaphor for our own feelings of entrapment and marginalization in our lives.]]></description>
