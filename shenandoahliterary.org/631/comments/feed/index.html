					<description><![CDATA[I appreciate Bodeur’s acknowledgment of the emotional effects of environmental degradation. Development for human communities often shows a thoughtless disregard for the natural state of the world. There’s a sense of helpless desperation when he says, “Now, only these dozen trees divide me / from townhouses sprouting from the hills.” At the end, Bodeur’s realization feels as if it’s too late to change what has been done. He wants to protect himself from the depression of urbanization and barren land, but he can’t. He “used to have a view for twenty acres,” yet now just a measly “stand of swamp maples” incites his sad nostalgia.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Outstanding review, focusing on the work not the &quot;Dickey stories&quot; (which I personally am tired of hearing about).   Let us celebrate with William Wright the overwhelming success of Dickey&#039;s long, poetic career of experimentation and invention, which makes so many other writers pale in comparison.   Even now, much critical work needs to be done to articulate Dickey&#039;s poetic principles, especially for his middle and late work.   As Kenneth Burke noted, terminology coaches perception.  We need a critical vocabulary to catch up to the amazing stylistic achievement that is Dickey&#039;s legacy.]]></description>
