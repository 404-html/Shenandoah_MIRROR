					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s why we read - to get a sense of things that we didn&#039;t get to experience... or want to experience, or have to experience.  This story provides more of that in a small space than usual.  Rich in detail and sad in unmentioned ways, it highlights pointlessness, humanness, suffering, and a curiosity special to mankind.  It says so much with so little - it&#039;s great.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love this style of writing. I feel like I&#039;m there, but with the haze of not quite knowing what&#039;s has happened until later. Just enough information to accept the reality, think about it, and move on. Beautiful and, as others have said, thought-provoking. Thank you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love this short story! Especially the character of Stink and his odd habits and concerns.  His world is so vivid and dangerous and tragic, yet we are allowed a peek into his childishness and his youthfulness.  Congrats, Shenandoah, for picking this one up.]]></description>
