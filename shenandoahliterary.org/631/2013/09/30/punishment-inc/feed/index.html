					<description><![CDATA[What an excellent story this is: up there, for me and by approximate type, with Lore Moore&#039;s &quot;How to Become a Writer.&quot; Cloutier&#039;s story ends right where it should and on a perfect tragi-comic note -- tragic for the &quot;villian, comic for the reader. All the invented offerings by the revenge company are (literally) terrific: &quot;anal leakage&quot; and Lorena as UNICEF stand way out for me. In my opinion, this story should get the top award from SHENANDOAH.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Three things made this story stand out to me.  
1. The constant return of the wayward husband to take one more stupid thing from the wife he left makes the reader dread every day and what more he can do to her

2. The fresh take on revenge, with the breezy and imaginative packages the Punishment Company offers
3. The use of ice cream as a narrative knife.

Endings are always hard, but the author managed to add another layer by having the main character abruptly and very vividly describe both Daryl&#039;s new look and the impact of that kiss.  Well done, and a lot of fun.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Cloutier&#039;s story successfully creates a tongue-in-cheek tale of marital revenge. The best moments of the story, however, come with the realization that these outlandish modes of retribution reflect a deeper emotion. What is just? How does one measure their own self-worth? Does love ever really dissipate? In just around 1200 words Punishment, Inc. addresses these fundamental questions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I thought that this story was hilarious. The strength of this story is the little details that Cloutier inserts, like the &quot;wilted&quot; spinach she wants to put his cut off penis on, the specific type of carpet he tries to pull up, the deliberation about which finger to cut off, and the ice cream motif of pistachio nut butter, rum raisin, and cherry custard. I also liked the edge of improbability that Punishment, Inc. straddled. I suppose there are probable ways to give somebody boils but it all seemed vaguely supernatural, and I liked the blurred lines.  The note of tenderness at the end was just right.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is an inventively funny story, and I agree with Cezarija, made more delightful a revenge story for its sweetness at the end. It is a twist where we see for a moment the love between Daryl &#038; Lorena, and are touched by it. Well done, Martin Cloutier.]]></description>
