					<description><![CDATA[So much is conveyed in this short story-- time(s) when wars split families: one goes; one stays.
Place--farm and the outside world.
Relationships--entwined and frayed

But it&#039;s very particular to this visit, these brothers, this young woman.

I love the title most, however, and how the author worked the concept into the story, with both the visit to the barn, and the last two lines.  He wanted something sweet.  He was powerless to get it.  Really well done.]]></description>
