					<description><![CDATA[This is one of the finest, most beautifully written novels I&#039;ve read in a good while.  I disagree completely with the statement that the book is plotless.  Downbeat ending?  This is a serious work of literary fiction, not a t.v. show in the manner of so many  so-called &quot;reality&quot; series.  As for the &quot;thematization&quot; (what a word!) of writing, Orr makes clear at the outset what writing means to the young Emma.  Her use of Emma&#039;s diary entries has nothing to do with Orr&#039;s academic background.  I hope this novel receives the careful attention it deserves in future reviews, especially the way its language moves and carries the reader closer and closer to the physical and emotional experience of its characters.]]></description>
