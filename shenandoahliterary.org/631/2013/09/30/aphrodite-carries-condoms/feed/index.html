					<description><![CDATA[I clearly am not the first to say this, but the juxtaposition of the two writing styles here is on pointe. The conversation between Gracie and Shelby is entirely believable and does not seem at all forced or fabricated--I believe that both the nature of their discussion and the manner in which they hold it will be relatable to many young women. The inclusion of the quotes from what seems to essentially be a 20th-century conduct manual provides a wonderful contrast and deepens the story a great deal, allowing the reader to determine what message should ultimately be taken away from this story.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I find myself coming back to this story in the issue again and again.  The juxtaposition of a modern conversation between girlfriends and the textbook-like quotations from a twentieth-century &quot;conduct book&quot; for women allows the reader a glimpse at both the differences and similarities in how sex is discussed.  More than anything, though, the dialogue is charming, and the story never fails to make me laugh!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Cool idea for a story, resonated deeply with &quot;The thing about Shelby is that she always gets it. She knows my gynecologist story is about a lot of things&quot; and the fact that we, too, should understand this story is about a lot of things.  Loved the premise, thought the quotes worked perfectly.  Well done!]]></description>
