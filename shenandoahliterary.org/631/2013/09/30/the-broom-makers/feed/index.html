					<description><![CDATA[A nice story, except for the fact that African-Americans were not allowed to serve as infantry combatants in either World War I or World War II. Black soldiers fought as foot soldiers during the Civil War, on the side of the Union, and were lead by white officers. In 1948, President Truman issued the order to integrate the services, and when the Korean War broke out in 1950, blacks served again as foot soldiers, and to this day have continued to serve proudly.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I found this story to be very compelling. I was really interested in the character of Jordan, and the friendship that he and Paul were forming.  The focus on the interracial nature of the friendship was relevant back then but I think is still relevant today, making this story more timeless. Paul&#039;s stubborn nature was well-developed throughout the story, and this made his action of forcing Jordan to come to the bar with him more believable.  That part made me very anxious so the foreshadowing that something bad was going to happen was done very well, like the crowd thinning out and the bartender getting angrier.  I really felt for Jordan, who was such nice guy and a good friend but still got in trouble because his white friend was just too stubborn.  The only part of the story that I found less believable was when Paul decided to kill everyone with grenades--it seemed very sudden, and I had thought the story was more about friendship than Paul&#039;s anger.  Granted, he was angry because his friend got fired and decided to retaliate, but I had pictured him going off to find Jordan and quitting his job or something.  Nevertheless, I really enjoyed this piece.]]></description>
