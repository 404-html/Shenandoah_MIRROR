					<description><![CDATA[I appreciate Bodeur’s acknowledgment of the emotional effects of environmental degradation. Development for human communities often shows a thoughtless disregard for the natural state of the world. There’s a sense of helpless desperation when he says, “Now, only these dozen trees divide me / from townhouses sprouting from the hills.” At the end, Bodeur’s realization feels as if it’s too late to change what has been done. He wants to protect himself from the depression of urbanization and barren land, but he can’t. He “used to have a view for twenty acres,” yet now just a measly “stand of swamp maples” incites his sad nostalgia.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The melancholy tone of this poem sparks feelings of wistfulness and reminiscence towards an older age of green trees and open fields. Brodeur&#039;s work successfully creates an intimate encounter with development and the loss of nature in a progressive world, drawing the reader into his own pain. The trees must come down despite the narrator&#039;s resistance to the townhouse development, and I can feel the distraught with which he exacerbates the ugliness of a nature-less world.]]></description>
