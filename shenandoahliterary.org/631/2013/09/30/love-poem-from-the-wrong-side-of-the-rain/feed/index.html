					<description><![CDATA[The characterization of the seasons and the seasonal transition is particularly compelling.  April will assume agency when it &quot;teases hidden/ meanings from the bulbs.&quot;  However, winter still dominates the natural landscape, but is beginning to ebb: &quot;skinny March at an earnest latitude.&quot;  The features of nature also possess emotional depth, as exemplified in this &quot;season of embarrassed trees.&quot;  In the final stanza, the speaker invokes a classical influence in referencing the Muse and suggesting a teasing, even flighty view of spring love.  Overall, this is an intriguing view of the natural world and its transitions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love how this poem takes the stereotypical &quot;love poem of spring&quot; and turns it on its head with its cheekiness.  This is a great original take on a common theme.]]></description>
