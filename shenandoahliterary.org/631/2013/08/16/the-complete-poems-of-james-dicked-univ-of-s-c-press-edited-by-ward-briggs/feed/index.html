					<description><![CDATA[Outstanding review, focusing on the work not the &quot;Dickey stories&quot; (which I personally am tired of hearing about).   Let us celebrate with William Wright the overwhelming success of Dickey&#039;s long, poetic career of experimentation and invention, which makes so many other writers pale in comparison.   Even now, much critical work needs to be done to articulate Dickey&#039;s poetic principles, especially for his middle and late work.   As Kenneth Burke noted, terminology coaches perception.  We need a critical vocabulary to catch up to the amazing stylistic achievement that is Dickey&#039;s legacy.]]></description>
