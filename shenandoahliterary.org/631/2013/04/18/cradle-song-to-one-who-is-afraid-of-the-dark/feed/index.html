					<description><![CDATA[I love the flow of this poem. The ending is wonderful, and I particularly like the lack of punctuation after &quot;this,&quot; because it adds a feeling of trailing off that goes with the natural flow of the poem.

I think that this intimate yet conversational feel is the poem&#039;s biggest strengths: each &quot;descriptor&quot; of a shadow could stand alone or unite without the ending, and the poem would still be beautiful and haunting.]]></description>
