					<description><![CDATA[Donald Platt&#039;s poems have long astonished me, as does this one.  This poem&#039;s quiet, conversational voice gathers like a whirlwind -- a spiraling of seamless associations -- vortex of history being dragged through moment-to-moment ephemerality&#039;s actions and feelings and excellence and dailiness.  Time feels large, but it also feels exquisitely detailed.  The patient becomes the analyst becomes the brother becomes an everyman whose possibly dying wife becomes another woman already dead yet alive through the story of her talent&#039;s brevity and the tragic replaying of her recorded music.  This is such a poigant, smart poem.]]></description>
