								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What a pleasure it’s been to spend time with Kay Byer’s volume of meditative poems and find there a poetry that is profound but that resists the temptation to flaunt all of the effort it took to be that way.  These poems reveal their power not through linguistic pyrotechnics or thematic novelty but, rather, by risking honesty without stumbling over the ledge of sentimentality.</p>
<p>Byer has tied the volume’s three sections together in a narrative arc that considers family and loss, the struggle of white Southerners of a certain age to come to terms with the racism sewn into the fabric of their childhoods, and the wisdom available to those who continue into middle age reflecting upon the currents of love and resistance that battle in memory for a lifetime.  The thematic ties of the three sections are punctuated by recurring declarations of identity.  In the first section’s “Lost,” a poem dedicated to a young girl who appears to be the poet’s aunt and namesake, a dying child negotiates with God, “yearning / to say Here I am / but am not.”  In “Southern Fictions,” the middle section’s sonnet sequence confronting identity and race, a black girl calls out “Here I am” to announce from outside the house her arrival to clean as the family’s father broods over his failure to protest the abuse of black residents by local white bullies.  “First Presbyterian,” a poem appearing early in the volume’s final section, picks up on an earlier poem’s theological skepticism and ends “. . . Just As I Am, we sang, closing the service. / My soul took a deep breath and walked out.” Finally, in “Here,” the volume’s last poem, the speaker reflects on the arc of her life:  “. . . Over thirty years I’ve watched the way / light begins here. It still wakes me up. Lets me be. / Here. Where I am.”</p>
<p>Readers will return more than once to “Southern Fictions,” the book’s most powerful poem. Here, Byer displays in form and content the tensions between cherishing a place and regretting its history, between love of family and disappointment in their subtle complicity in injustice.  It is clear that the poet abhors racism, but the poems are sonnets.  Through their form and subtle music they exhibit tenderness as well as outrage.</p>
<p>Poems of reflection upon family, death, race, and identity are too often assigned these days to the shelf labeled “regional,” but only a narrow reading would suggest that the poems in <em>Descent</em> are parochial. Rather, they are well-crafted leanings into the universal concerns of family, place, and the continuing struggle to see oneself in the “other.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Southern Cross the Dog</em> recounts the odyssey of young Robert Chatham, as first-time novelist Bill Cheng portrays the themes of racial tension, adolescent love, emotional hardships, and the destruction incurred by nature.  As he travels throughout the South, Robert faces many trials and tribulations, all of which test his will to survive and mold his views of life and Southern society.  Channeling William Faulkner in his use of dialects and depiction of Southern life, Cheng illustrates Robert’s physical passage throughout the South as he grapples with his mental struggle between the past and future.</p>
<p>As Cheng portrays the obstacles Robert faces in his trek throughout the Deep South, the 8-year-old protagonist faces the trauma of the Great Flood of 1927 amidst the social and economic trauma of the Depression.  Also set in the Jim Crow era of heightened racial tensions and legal segregation, <em>Southern Cross the Dog</em> directly tackles these topics.  However, the novel lacks true focus as Cheng waffles between a myriad of characters, places, and time periods.  After the world around him collapses and is washed away, Robert journeys through Mississippi, a land Cheng himself had never experienced before authoring his Southern novel.  During this devastating flood, “houses [bleed] out their insides” as people “[bubble] up swollen and drowned, rag-dolling in the current.”  This Flood, an allegory stretching beyond that of Noah’s biblical tale, incurs this violent cleansing upon Robert, his family, and his community.  The storm ravages both the physical town and the young protagonist’s youth; it is the brutal force of nature that shapes Robert’s journey and his sense of self throughout this epic novel.</p>
<p>Carrying this religious significance beyond the novel’s initial pages, Cheng also weaves major religious themes in the fabric of his story.  Throughout the novel, the dog motif invokes the devil, and constantly haunts Robert throughout his journey.  In the section entitled “Hotel Beau-Miel (1932),” Robert hears the “dog pace anxiously outside Percy’s Pharmacy.”  Robert believes the dog’s barks “[sound] far away and haunting, calling out from the world’s end.”  Here Cheng again invokes religious allegories, referencing the apocalypse.  Cheng infuses the dog with this otherworldly, devilish nature.  The dog seems to straddle these two worlds, looming over Robert’s physical senses and consciousness; Cheng similarly straddles the line between presenting a true southern novel and a southern parody.  This magnified fear stems from stories he had heard about these animals.  All of Cheng’s religious references seem to suggest the presence of sin and the need for humanity to be cleansed.  Framed by his interactions with people on the fringes of society, such as the wily fur-trappers, Cheng’s depictions of these societal outskirts are meant to juxtapose with his many references to the heart of religious themes. The allegories serve to complicate the nature of the novel, yet also evoke this call for redemption for both Robert and the South.  Part Four is even titled, “A Shining New South,” reverberating these mandates for redemption and salvation.</p>
<p>As Robert continues his journey, he makes his way through a whorehouse, treacherous swamp, and even the racial prejudice abounding in the Southern United States during the 20th century.  Robert’s physical passage throughout Mississippi mirrors his navigation through this myriad of racial issues and the individuals he encounters.  While African-Americans are no longer confined to the bonds of slavery, figurative chains remain in place, stunting the development and change of Southern society after the Civil War; Cheng fuses religion and racial tension to convey this commentary.  Robert experiences various racial situations and individuals affected by these laws in his travels.  In a flashback, Robert recounts his birthday the previous year.  On this occasion, he wanders into a dirty, empty bar with this friendly sign: “coloreds welcome.”  Here, a kind white man emerges from a trap door, offers him a seat at the counter, and gives him a sandwich on the house.</p>
<p>As evidenced in this scene, Cheng frequently jumps around in the chronology of his narrative, oftentimes oscillating between the past and present.  Then he flashes forward in the narrative, highlighting Robert’s sexual encounter with the white bar owner’s mentally handicapped African-American daughter.  This departure from cross-raced kindness to this fleeting sexual episode provides a new shade on race relations, evoking the sensibility of Tom Jones, Fielding’s eighteenth century picaresque novel.  Molly Seagrim seduces Tom in the novel, just as the bar owner’s daughter ignites sexual relations between herself and Robert.  In this novel of survival and racial strain, Robert even works as a slave laborer in the swamp, yet manages to escape.  When he disappears, Robert is referred to as the “missing Negro,” and is filed “among the other transients of the country.”  He emerges from the depth of the swamp “half dead and all the way alive” and into a zealous colored church service about the Devil.  In this scene, Cheng cleverly unites race, religion, and the dog motif.  Preaching to the congregation, the reverend roars “That low sniffling dog that howls at your back door!  Hear him, brothers, hear!  He calls for blood!”  Startled by the sermon, Robert seeks Eli’s help, yet is rebuffed.  While the book itself is fragmented into six sections and often jumps forward and backward in time, Robert’s sense of time is similarly fractured.  Cheng writes “The one truth God has ever given to a man.  And it’s that the past keeps happening to us.  No matter who we are or how far we get away, it keeps happening to us.”  Robert finally reaches where the “Southern cross the Dog,” two iconic railroads, which Cheng manipulates to depict the Southern world and society’s interactions with the Devil, a force Robert battles throughout his odyssey.</p>
<p>Uniting these themes as well as Robert’s fragmented sense of time and consciousness, Cheng attempts to present this coming of age novel, both concerning his young protagonist and the South.  Unfortunately, Cheng’s attempts are just that; he shies away from a thorough presentation of plot and loses the reader in the overdone time oscillations, fragmentations, and frequent narrator shifts.  While <em>Southern Cross the Dog</em> certainly possesses gleams of brilliance, Cheng’s debut novel falls short of becoming the iconic, successful novels of predecessors such as Faulkner and Twain.  Each of the novel’s landscapes represents new territory for both Robert and Cheng, territory that Cheng endeavors to navigate, but through which he ultimately remains off-track.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/631/files/2013/11/guestsonearth.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-718" alt="guestsonearth" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/631/files/2013/11/guestsonearth.jpeg" width="159" height="241" /></a>Lee Smith’s has long written perceptively about Southern women (<em>Family Linen, Oral History, Saving Grace</em>), and her new novel, <em>Guests on Earth</em>, is no exception.  Grounded in the 1948 burning of the Highland Hospital in Asheville, North Carolina, the novel tells the story of an orphan from New Orleans, Evalina Toussaint, who is admitted to the hospital as a young girl and lives out much of her young life there, as patient and guest.</p>
<p>Readers may already be aware that Zelda Fitzgerald, the hospital’s most famous patient, died in the fire, but the details of her frenetic dancing and painting add drama and shape to the novel.  Fitzgerald is not the center of this story, however; she comes and goes, as she did in life.  It is Evalina’s early life with a disturbed, talented mother and her episodes of friendship, rivalry, and partnership with the various inhabitants of Highland that drive the plot.</p>
<p>The novel is episodic and covers a long period of time.  Evalina comes to the hospital, grows up, leaves for a while and returns; she makes friends and loses them; she falls into and out of love.  The fates of patients who have left is sometimes reported second- or third-hand.  The sequences are loosely connected, mostly by the proximity of Evalina to the persons, events, and reporting of news.  The “Intermezzo” section, which tells several years of Evalina’s young adulthood through letters, departs even more radically from the conventional narration of the rest.</p>
<p>What holds the novel together is the evolution of Evalina’s character.  She comes to Highland a frightened child, having already lived through her mother’s and a humiliating Jane-Eyre-like experience of living with her mother’s lover’s wife and children.  But she is the novel’s narrator—a rather old-fashioned intrusive one at that—and she establishes her credibility on the first page.  So as the other patients appear, disappear, and sometimes reappear, Evalina can be trusted to describe them and comment on their various illnesses, and the novel becomes both a fictional memoir and a commentary on both the history mental health treatment and the pressures that drive unusual personalities into “insanity.”</p>
<p>Several of the female characters, including Fitzgerald, are driven to the hospital by their inability to live the professional lives they seek, by their unhappy, inescapable marriages, or by seemingly well-meaning judges who misinterpret desperation or sexual assertion as “moral imbecility.”  But this is not just a book about women, though they figure largely in the number of Highland’s patient list.  The young boy Robert, whose genius and social awkwardness mark him for institutionalization, the war veteran suffering from shell shock, and the young man called Pan, who prefers to live outdoors all find refuge—for a time—in the progressive treatments at the hospital.</p>
<p>Some readers will find the “Intermezzo” section odd, and there are a few episodes, such as the one late in the novel when a friend returns with two men and tries to convince Evalina to run off with them, go nowhere (In this case Evalina turns down the invitation and returns to the hospital).  Other readers may object that the historical figure of real interest is Zelda Fitzgerald, and her intermittent appearance is a flaw in the structure.  In this instance, however, the absences of the more famous historical figures actually keeps the focus on the variety and number of other, equally complex and valuable persons who inhabit the hospital.</p>
<p>The way Zelda Fitzgerald comes and goes also keeps the center of the narrative on Evalina, and when she connects the memory of Zelda with the memory of her mother, Evalina ties the book together very nicely indeed.  The mother seems to disappear from the story when she dies, but in fact she has lived on in the empathetic responses of her daughter, whose refusal to judge harshly, in turn, creates empathy for the misunderstood, misdiagnosed, and often mistreated characters who find their ways to the hospital.</p>
<p>As a historical novel, then, <em>Guests on Earth</em> is somewhat unusual.  The great cataclysmic cultural and political events, such as war and changing notions of the human mind, are certainly present, but they do not loom over the entire book.  Nor is the story dominated by a larger-than-life historical figure.  This is a quiet novel, and its most moving tragedies are local, domestic, and often private, yet they are tragedies all the same, and the as book seems to wind its way through these many lives, it keeps its compass firmly pointed on Evalina.  The ending seems inevitable, though certainly not predictable, and with the skill of a master novelist, Lee Smith brings together all of the narrative paths to a single, beautiful moment in a conclusion that stops the story not so much at completion as at a satisfying stepping-stone back into the present day.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Native Ground</strong></p>
<p>For the past twenty or so years, I have made a career as a teacher of American literature.  For nearly fifteen, I have worked also, with equal seriousness and passion, as a photographer.</p>
<p>My series <strong>Native Ground</strong> unites these pursuits in an exploration of the role place plays in shaping the literary imagination: the notion that writers compose out of a peculiar understanding and depth of connection to physical space, remembered or immediate.  Personal and professional interests have led me to focus on writers who have lived and worked in the Southern region of the United States.</p>
<p>Using a primitive hand-held film camera, for this series I am making images that depict points of origin—meditating on personal spaces and landscapes in light of my familiarity with and curiosity about selected writers’ works and biographies.   They are particularly intimate photographs that propose narratives of connection in the development of vision and voice.</p>
<p>Robert Adams, a great contemporary photographer of the American West who was originally an English professor, says in his book <em>Why People Photograph</em>:</p>
<p><em>At our best and most fortunate we make pictures because of what stands in front of the camera, to honor what is greater and more interesting than we are.  We never accomplish this perfectly, though in return we are given something perfect—a sense of inclusion.  Our subject thus redefines us, and is part of the biography by which we want to be known.</em> (179)</p>
<p>Perhaps this explains my fascination with this subject—these places I visit and stitch with threads of my imagination to works I love, which have spoken to me, and which over time have surely shaped my own identity.  For me, the photographs are another form of sense-making.</p>
<p>In this regard, the photographs in <strong>Native Ground</strong> are a kind of supreme fiction: my imagination of how physical spaces, lives lived, and art converge.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Terrified and fanatical, the characters in <em>Under the Red Flag</em> run amok. In his collection of short stories, Ha Jin depicts the calamity of mass hysteria, which fueled the delirium in Mao-China’s Cultural Revolution. As a teenager, Jin joined the People’s Liberation Army at the height of the radical chaos, a period when neighbors, friends, and even family turned on each other in paranoid frenzy to show dedication to Mao’s campaign for cultural upheaval. Although this was a time of harrowing confusion, Jin’s prose does not embellish. He maintains a straight-forward narrative. The bluntness of which may cause readers to glide through passages describing acts as gruesome as gang rape and decapitation as if they were depictions of landscape. &#8220;In Broad Daylight,&#8221; the opening story, is a proper representative of this style. As a woman is publicly humiliated for sexual liaisons, her supposed cuckold of a husband kills himself. Ha Jin writes, &#8220;The dead man was Meng Su. A crowd had gathered at the railroad two hundred yards east of the station house. A few men were examining the rail that was stained with blood and studded with bits of flesh. One man paced along the darker part of the rail and announced that the train had dragged Meng at least seventy feet.&#8221; The most sinister stories, however, ironically end with the protagonist receiving a windfall. One of these is “Winds and Clouds over a Funeral,” where an oath to a dying grandmother is overlooked in order to serve the Chinese Communist Party. Through dizzying manipulation and a touch of magical luck, this event turns the disobedient son into the vice-magistrate of his village. The grandson, whose guilt until that point overwhelmed him, flushes all shame away as he considers that now he may have his pick of the “prettiest girl[s] of the factory.”</p>
<p>It was only fifty years ago that the Cultural Revolution enveloped China in complete disorder. Yet, there is relatively little literature that explores this strange time experienced by at least 185 million people living today. Jin’s stories delineate the most inspired and desperate survival tactics, and yet they all retain a sense of humanity. In &#8220;Taking a Husband,&#8221; a new bride hides herself in a freezing well to escape the debasing attack on her wedding banquet by the local Red Guard, whose leader is a scorned ex-suitor. In “The Richest Man,” a stingy doctor is resented by everyone in the village due to his material wealth. With ferocious ease, the villagers are able to fabricate reasons to publicly denounce and punish him, although the accusations are as insubstantial as the broken button they present as evidence to his misdeeds. The last story, &#8220;A Decade,&#8221; is narrated by a former student as she laments the calumny of her once beautiful teacher, who was forced into hard labor, and is now as spiteful as everyone else. Jin’s ability in impartial but powerful story-telling is demonstrated through his efficient pacing. The Flannery O’Connor Award for this book is justly deserved as he describes the horrific and banal in the same tone. For example, as a child, nicknamed &#8220;Grandson,&#8221; is brutally beaten by Party officers in “Emperor,” Jin does not dwell in dramatics. &#8220;We all followed them to see what would happen to him, while the latrine cleaners laughed with their heads thrown back, pointing at Grandson, who was kicking in the air. Then they shouldered their loads of night soil and set out for Elm Village, where they lived. One of them carried two empty buckets with his pole.&#8221; Similar to O’Connor’s style, the deaths, terror, and torture are abrupt and unceremonious. Ha Jin’s <em>Under the Red Flag</em> translates both the stoicism and silent sorrow of the Cultural Revolution&#8217;s survivors.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dawn came upon the Eastern Shore of Virginia when the farmers were already working.  The tomatoes were staked and tied, heavy with fruit, ready for picking.  The corn fields were tall and green, and long irrigators stretched across the square plots.  Tourists laughed and drove toward Chincoteague Island to watch the wild ponies shake the flies from their necks in the heat.  Seagulls, scanning for carrion, flew around the chicken processing factories.  Employees at Tyson and Perdue labored in bloody, fat-soaked uniforms while the chickens died screaming.  Truck drivers pushed the fifty-five mile an hour speed limit up and down Highway Thirteen, which sliced the Eastern Shore in half, while the lifeguards blew their whistles at fat men swimming too far out from the beach on Assateague National Wildlife Refuge.</p>
<p>The sun finally started to lower, and the heat left off.  In the center of the Eastern Shore there was a chicken farm, quiet now.  The catchers had come in their swirl of powder and arm stockings and sweat and caught seventy-five thousand chickens from the five houses, loaded them into cages, and fork lifted the cages onto trucks.  The last truck drove away and silence came.  Not a single person left.  The grower had gone home and the catchers were already sleeping.  All of the chickens were gone.  Except for one.  In the afternoon’s commotion, and a small fight between the forklift driver and a catcher which ended with the interference of a crew manager, somehow, one single chicken had been missed in a house of 15,000.</p>
<p>That chicken had sat, blinking in the dust as the last truck had driven off with a small Swastika hung on the top cage of the doomed chickens, a joke by one of the catchers that a trucker would later discover when he pulled into the processing plant.  The chicken was disoriented by the sudden solitude.  The heat of the day and that of 14,999 companions was gone.  The plastic dividers were gone, along with the gloved hands of catchers catching.  The water containers were raised as were the feeders.  The only things left were the filthy shavings and rice hulls and the excrement of her previous companions mixed with her own.</p>
<p>She was a she and she was all alone in the chicken house.  Four hundred feet by fifty feet of darkness looked back at the confused chicken.  Forklift tracks graced the entrance to the wide open doors, not one hundred feet from Highway Thirteen.  In the stillness, the chicken moved.  She was alive, unharmed somehow.  Left behind, saved as it were.  She did not make the trip to the factory where she would have been electrocuted, had her throat slit, plunged into boiling water and then been cut apart and wrapped into plastic and rerouted down Highway Thirteen to a grocery store somewhere on the mainland.</p>
<p>She breathed air cleaner than it had been in the fifty-one days she had been raised in the chicken house.  At a neat five pounds, two ounces, she stood up and looked around.  There was no food or water and no reason to stay still, so she walked outside into the setting sunlight.  Had she hung around she might have starved to death or, more likely the grower would have been back eventually with the next round of chickens, killing her surely, as she would not match in body weight with the new arrivals.  She left through the wide open doors and crossed the highway, surprising several tourists and one NASA employee driving home from Wallops Island.  Zigzagging, feathers flying, she made it across, kept on through several backyards and went into a small woods.</p>
<p>From there it is hard to say.  Maybe she lucked out again and found a childless, lonely couple raising chickens in their yard who would happily add her to their tiny population of ten laying hens where she could live comfortably for the rest of her life.  Or maybe she met a dog tied on a chain and was devoured by his jaws.  There is no way to tell.  But for that moment, as the sky went blue and pink over green fields and the grey ocean and bay bordering the Eastern Shore, she was walking free, breathing sweet smelling air with just a hint of salt, and making a friendly clucking into the painted evening sky.  And if I were you, I would hold on to that.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8220;This book is intended to provide intelligent girls with a scientific account of sex and human reproduction and to have the whole subject set in its proper relation to the rest of life.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="right">ATTAINING WOMANHOOD: <i>A Doctor Talks to Girls About Sex</i></p>
<p align="right">George W. Corner, M.D. 1939</p>
<p>“So there I am, flat on my back with my feet in the stirrups, Dr. Andersen has his hand up my hoo­hah, and he says ‘how many sexual partners have you <i>had</i>, Ms. Jensen?’”</p>
<p>Shelby laughs and commiserates, “How embarrassing.”</p>
<p>I finish my wine and signal the waiter for another. “Yeah don’t those guys know they’re not allowed to talk to you <i>during</i> the actual examination? Immediately before, yeah, right after, okay, but not during. How are you supposed to pretend that as a doctor, he’s not really a person, if he is asking you questions, especially about sex?”</p>
<p>“And they’re not allowed to be good looking,” Shelby adds. “Well, <i>female</i> good looking is okay. <i>Old man</i> good looking is okay. But <i>sexual being</i> good looking—never.”</p>
<p>The wine makes me laugh harder than it is funny. But Shelby and I always laugh. I try to imagine having this conversation with anybody else. Can’t do it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8220;Good things can however be overdone; and sometimes a friendship between girls oversteps the bounds of calmness and good judgement . . . and may even cause difficulty in making proper adjustments to the other sex in social life, courtship and marriage.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The happy hour mob gets noisier as it gets more crowded. Most are on the make like I would be, but with Shelby what we’re here to make is a meal. God bless free appetizers and cheap drinks. Even so, her as angel-­on­-my­-shoulder whispering in my ear is never as loud as the dude with the horns and goatee on the other side. Sometimes I think I’d test positive for a trace of Y chromosome, the way I’m in such rush to get a guy I just met into the sack, then in an all­-fired hurry to get the hell outta there after I’ve had my way with him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8220;There are certain differences between girls and boys in the expression of sex feelings. In this the male must take the lead.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shelby swirls her White Russian, watching the milk blend again with the Kahlua. “Well, what did you say? To the doctor, I mean.” She knows the truth, but can’t imagine me saying, <i>You mean I’m supposed to keep track?</i></p>
<p>“I said, ‘Well, I was in a relationship for a couple years and then I wasn’t.’”</p>
<p>“And?”</p>
<p>“And nothing. He exchanges a <i>significant glance</i> with his assistant and proceeds with the lecture on sexually transmitted diseases. It’s not like I don’t know all that stuff, so I interrupt. ‘I’m in a monogamous relationship now.’”</p>
<p>“I hope that lie was only for him.” She uses her concerned friend tone. “I mean, you’re not lying to yourself, are you?” If Shelby and I were the model for a research project, I’d say we both stand as proof a guy who thinks his love comes with ownership rights is far more dangerous to a woman than a virus. Shelby sets down her glass and squeezes my hand. “Gracie. Unprotected sex can <i>kill</i> you.”</p>
<p>“I know—and you of all people know it doesn’t take a <i>disease</i> to get the job done—but the details of my personal life are none of his business.”</p>
<p>Shelby nods. “Isn’t it ridiculous that women like us feel free to choose to have sex with whomever we wish, but feel compelled to pretend that we don’t?” Yeah, she really does talk like that. She sips her drink thoughtfully. “You know ‘nice girls don’t sleep around’ is ingrained so deeply, we’ll never be completely rid of it.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8220;Civilized mankind has a set of ideals, laws, and religious principals which aim to keep the animal part of sex under control, to surround it with the decency and dignity properly belonging to human life.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The thing about Shelby is that she always gets it. She knows my gynecologist story is about a lot of things.</p>
<p>“Yeah, the rule is that nice girls, say, <i>you</i>, get seduced or overwhelmed or drunk so you can have sex with a guy you just met. Sluts like me just act like we enjoy it.” I give Shelby my skank­-on­-the­-make, hiking up my skirt and leaning over the table so my cleavage shows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8220;Having arranged to have two sexes, nature must also provide whatever lures and attractions are necessary to bring the two sexes together at mating time.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She giggles. “Wait, I’m confused.” She does bimbo, raising a hand to her cheek in wide­-eyed confusion. “Is that your slut or seduced nice girl look?”</p>
<p>“Depends.” Laughing, I get even more into it, shimmying my shoulders to imaginary music. “Who’s doing the looking? A man I’m going to sleep with . . . or not?” I bat my eyes in chaste flirtation.</p>
<p>Shelby points out how we have managed to attract the attention of the guys at the bar and says, “I wonder if they can hear us. You know that word SLUT sure carries.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think I’ve ever used the word SLUT so much in conversation.” We emphasize the word without actually raising our voices.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8220;Good common sense backs up the standards of morality which warn us trouble lies in sexual relations other than those of marriage.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Slut, slut, slut.” Shelby says.</p>
<p>We giggle manically because the more adolescent we become, the more the boys at the bar show interest.</p>
<p>Laughter begets laughter, but before we lapse into hysteria, Shelby makes us serious again, “So Gracie, what did the doctor say? What’s wrong with you?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8220;Discussion about venereal disease, except by doctors, is indecent.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Nothing. Just some infection that cleared up with antibiotics.”</p>
<p>“Gracie. You do know that you must always use condoms.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Shelby. I usually do.”</p>
<p>“Always!” she commands.</p>
<p>“Always.” I repeat obediently.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>They arrive late to the scene, the oily smoke from the damaged vehicles diminishing to a slow pulse, soldiers going from alert attention to disinterest, then to the rooftops of the surrounding dun buildings and finally to bitter indifference, weapons leaning against their rigs as they light cigarettes or pinch fat lugs of Copenhagen between cheek and gum.  They missed the light up of the surrounding area, after Bravo 2/504 has already accidentally killed three old men in turbans in retaliation for the market bombing that has killed two of their friends.  The men were carrying canvas grocery bags filled with rice, papayas, and a leg of lamb, which is a feast out here, and unfortunately one of the men had a long black knobby walking stick that could look like a weapon in the right light, and some soldiers might wonder what they were going to celebrate with all that food anyway. It is dead center in the heat of the afternoon, and Stink can see the bristles of thirty or more angry and bored paratroopers along the rooftop, so he casually starts to look for any prizes in the blackened crater.  The dirt and rock is vaporized all the way down to the bottom, and when Stink bends into the shadow of the massive conical hole to examine some shiny metal he feels small and insignificant because the circles of discolored earth, each loop going back thousands of years, looks to him like concentric orbital rings, and there are chunks of crud here and there that seem to represent the planets, and he feels as if he is on the edge of the solar system, spinning wildly out of bounds.</p>
<p>He remembers making a diorama in Mrs. Phipps class, back when he believed he was going to be an astronaut, and he remembers that she was nice to him when all the other teachers were not. The rest of them told him he wasn’t smart enough to be an astronaut, and Stink had even caught Mr. Evans and Mrs. Dobbins joking that he was already a space cadet, but Mrs. Phipps had caught him crying even though he was too old to cry, and told him he could be anything he wanted to be, so when the Army recruiter drove the dirt roads from Lander, Wyoming, all the way out to the reservation just specially to see them, he thought it was fate when the man said he could be all he could be, because it sounded close enough.</p>
<p>Someone pops off a round at something and Stink crouches down, his M-4 across his chest and his right hand across the stock like he is pledging the allegiance, but that is all, and he hears ghostlike laughter from a group of soldiers so knows he can stand up again.  The further down he goes, the cooler it is, but he also knows that there won’t be anything at the bottom because there never is, and when there is, it is because whatever it is went straight up and then straight down and is always something horrible.  It smells bad in the massive hole though, like sewage and mold and things long dead, which is probably just because it is the ancient smell of a thousand years of this town growing from a camp to a village and then finally to a town, and Mrs. Phipps could undoubtedly tell him how long ago that was, if she were here.</p>
<p>Stink hears Corporal Binder yelling for him and he knows it is just because Lieutenant Clash found out that the rumors about the drinking cup next to his gear were true—he had been keeping a finger with a wedding band in there, under a wool sock he kept moist.  So suddenly everyone was paying him more attention and had stopped calling him Sitting Bull, but couldn’t help calling him Stink because even though he had done everything he could to keep it fresh, the finger ended up stinking real bad when they made him toss it out, and Lieutenant Clash had even been mad enough to pull the ring off the finger and toss it out to a bunch of kids disinterestedly kicking a duct taped soccer ball around outside the grounds.  Someone had been reading a book where some soldiers find a perfectly sound uncircumcised penis, and told him he should look for that, and Stink couldn’t tell if it was a joke or not, but he looked for it anyway, just thinking how weird it would be to hold a penis in your hand like that when it wasn’t even your penis!  Stink thought it would be like when Winters taped the ear from a dead insurgent to the back of his neck and joked that no one would be able to sneak up on him now, even though pretty soon after that Winters got blown up three ears and all.</p>
<p>He’s obviously not going to find any prizes down here in the hole though because even the bits and pieces of things scattered about were probably accidentally kicked in there when they were lighting up all the adobe houses, and there were footprints, which meant all the good stuff would already be taken, but even so, at the very bottom he finds what looks like a deflated jellyfish like when they get washed up on the beach, and when he kicks it with his boot toe a little piece snaps off even though it looks thick and soft, so he reaches down and it is a big ragged circle of purple and black and green and blue glass and he thinks that heating up sand is how they make glass, and he wonders how hot it had to be down there to make glass from an explosion, and picks it up and can see there are pretty bubbles inside, and he thinks maybe he can sell it at the market.</p>
<p>He is rubbing the smudges off with his camo blouse when Nunez comes up and asks him, “The fuck’s that?” but doesn’t care to even get an answer before he is looking under the vehicle for something then hopping up on the hood to light a smoke, and he is staring at the three dead old man with the grocery bags, flies already buzzing all over the place and then Nunez says, “Fuckit,” and walks over and takes the rice and papayas that don’t have blood on them, walks around a big old wet hunk of someone, and tosses it all into the back of the Humvee, same place they had put the bag that was Winters a week before.  Then Nunez goes back and gets the meat too and he rubs the blood off the leg of lamb, throws it in the back of the vehicle and explains, “The blood will wash off that meat,” lights another cigarette, shrugs, “shame to let it all go to waste,” and Stink knows that now he’ll get to keep the glass because everyone will care more about whether Nunez is going to really eat that lamb.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>June Spoon, my mother, gets mad whenever Dadio swings at flies with rolled-up newspapers.  Sometimes he swings at roaches.  He doesn’t seem to care that someone might still want to check out the news.  I hate it when he uses the sports section.  Dadio dislikes animals, insects, and most creatures of the sea.  I know he despises his kids, especially me.  He avoids petting dogs and cats.  When he’s not swatting flies, he busies himself fumigating the house with Had-A-Bug to kill mosquitoes and setting traps for rats in the attic.  He uses coconut meat for bait.  Believe it or not, he once caught a crimson cardinal.  Don’t ask me how that bird got in there, but he did.  June Spoon told me that was her father’s favorite bird.  She cried for days.  She even suggested the cardinal was the reincarnation of Pops, and that God guided him to our home so he could listen to her soothing voice drift up through the ceiling.  She said Dadio might be guilty of murder, because reincarnation gave you a second chance at life before the Final Judgment.  Dadio overheard June Spoon’s accusation and smirked, mostly because he didn’t believe in God or life-after-death or “that reincarnation hogwash.”</p>
<p>The same week as the bird murder, June Spoon fakes stomach flu to avoid sex after a bottle of Lancer’s and <em>The Ed Sullivan Show</em>.  Now she’s going to sleep long after Dadio pulls on his pajamas.  “Get to bed, June,” he scolds from their room on a windy evening, his sullen voice rattling down the hall.  June Spoon sits at the dining room table, reading a crumpled paper stained with fly guts.  “In a minute, dear,” she lies.  She bites into an Almond Mounds while perusing the Obits.  She loves it how the women outlive the men, usually by a decade and sometimes even more.  She’s certain Dadio will return either as a fly or a mosquito, one that will bug her to no end all hours of the day and night.  She prays for a fly.  She imagines a big horsefly buzzing around a hunk of snow-white coconut perched on the table.  Yesterday she bought a jumbo swatter at Long’s Drugs, a pink one with a comfy handle she hid in her bathroom cabinet under the sink.  She washes the Mounds down with  tea.  June Spoon smiles.  She imagines swatting Dadio to end his second shot at life.  She figures God won’t accuse her of murder since she’s merely avenging her father’s death as a bird.  “Eye for an eye,” she whispers into the night.</p>
