								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was among the first birds my wife and I spotted on our first outing in Guatemala, in a busy grove beside a pond on a lush hillside. It’s not a hard bird to identify, a rich blue above, rusty-chested, but I was momentarily disoriented. Then I knew: what the hell are you doing here?  With recognition came the delight of finding an old friend in an unexpected place, in odd company, with a Social Flycatcher, a raucous clique of Band-backed Wrens, and, distantly calling, an Ocellated Quail we never did track down. I dimly recalled that Eastern Bluebird was on the tour checklist, but it wasn’t a bird I’d come here to see, and I wouldn’t have grumbled if I’d missed it. In fact, I abandoned it when our guide called out another thrush—Rufous-collared Robin—a life bird for me. I studied the robin a while, then returned to the bluebird, still fixed intently on its perch until it stooped for a bug. Around us, in a flurry with local sparrows and siskins, were other birds I knew well, Eastern Wood-Pewee, Magnolia Warbler, Ruby-throated Hummingbird—all “our birds,” that is, common where we live, in Eastern North America. After all, the bluebird and pewee didn’t get their names because they hail from East Guatemala.</p>
<p>I’ve felt this same little thrill of recognition, the same swelling of local pride—“There, that beauty is one of our birds!”—when I’ve found other Neotropical migrants in lands far from our home in Gloucester, Massachusetts. A flame-throated Blackburnian Warbler catches the sun as it forages in a treetop on a Venezuelan mountain. Two Wood Thrushes posture like street toughs and bicker over territory in our “yard” at Chan Chich Lodge in Belize. Of course, they’re not really “our” birds at all. Yes, we see them every year, though sometimes it takes effort, and some raise families in our town or not far from here. Yes, these are the birds, especially the wood warblers, that foreign birders yearn most to see when they come to New England in spring. But if home is where you spend most of your time, or the place to which you always return after a long, strenuous journey—what biologists call “site fidelity”&#8211;then for these birds home is tropical America, among manakins and antbirds quite exotic to any New Englander.</p>
<p>It might be more apt to say that meeting these birds abroad is like visiting the homes of friends, or nodding acquaintances, that you’ve known only on the job. Some, you find, behave quite differently on their home turf. Kentucky Warblers and Yellow-breasted Chats, skulking and elusive in Massachusetts, like underlings cowering in fear of reprimand, are hopping around out in the open as if they own the joint. The Eastern Kingbird, so bossy at work on its breeding territory, squelching rivals, harassing crows, joins a crew of wimpy kingbird transients on its winter grounds in western Amazonia. Steven Hilty describes it in Birds of Tropical America: “Its pugnacity is traded for docile subordination to virtually all its tropical relatives, and its territoriality is traded for a period of nomadic wandering.” And that Hooded Warbler couple, such a tight-knit unit at the nest, now hardly seem to know each other. They came down on separate flights, hang out in different clubs, and don’t even seem to like the same food. Other species give pleasure, and reassurance, simply because they seem so abundant on their winter grounds, packed into a space—suitable habitat in Central America—much smaller than their potential nesting area in North America. In the mountains of Guatemala, Wilson’s Warbler and Townsend’s Warbler became known to us as Mr. Wilson and Mr. Townsend, always around, always together.</p>
<p>Of course the work vs. home analogy doesn’t really hold up, just as it doesn’t apply to many humans, especially females, who have to work harder at home than they do at work. These birds aren’t lounging in Caribbean man caves or shooting the breeze around the barbecue. They’re not the free spirits some would like them to be. In fact, when I find these familiar birds in Guatemala, Venezuela, or as far south as Argentina, I’m always struck by how hard they must struggle just to get there and stay there. Their migrations are solitary, energy-sapping, life-risking journeys of thousands of miles, back and forth every year, often in miserable weather, without a map of the stars for navigation, and utterly self-propelled, with a self-reliance that shames us. They’re not whining about body scans or the size of the free pretzel packets.</p>
<p>If and when they finally do make it home, there’s no time to rest.  There are groceries to be gotten, a new set of predators to evade, from kinkajous to forest-falcons, and testy, territorial neighbors, the specialists whose dominance of well-defined tropical niches may have induced the migrants to migrate in the first place. “One bush,” says an ancient Greek proverb, “does not shelter two robins.” Or they may find that home isn’t there at all, that it’s under cultivation or pavement, and have to search for a new neighborhood. And in six months or so, they’ll have to do it all over again, accomplish the same amazing metabolic feat, with the same or greater problems awaiting them back at work. Some problems are man-made, theoretically fixable.  Others, like the conflict between migratory and maternal impulses, described by Charles Darwin in The Descent of Man, are as inescapable as the need to eat or preen. Leave now, when the time to migrate is ripe, forcing vulnerable offspring into their own lives of radical self-sufficiency, or wait until it may be too late? Those birds that never leave North America face their own dilemmas. Will they make it through the winter scarcity?</p>
<p>A visit to tropical America in winter, following the migrants and the mystery of migration, is also a trip back in time, recapitulating the dynamic course of avian life in the Western Hemisphere. In his article “Long Trail in the Sky: The Glacial Origins of Bird Migration,” Wayne Petersen says: “Many ornithologists believe that the modern-day migrations are reflective of long-term variations in climate and habitat that took millennia to forge into the migration patterns observable now.” In heading south, some migrants, including many sparrows and shorebirds, are not really heading home at all, for these are species whose ancient origins can be traced with some assurance to the temperate or boreal regions of North America. When the glaciers moved south, these birds went south too, faced by a choice between probable extinction and a journey to a region where food was still to be found. When the glaciers finally retreated, the birds returned to their historic breeding grounds, where food was again available, though many relive the prehistoric journeys south when the food supply grows leaner each fall. In his description of the Water Ouzel, a species of our Western mountains now known as the American Dipper, John Muir sees in the bird the full history of glaciation in North America: “Were the flights of all the ouzels in the Sierra traced on a chart, they would indicate the direction of the flow of the entire system of ancient glaciers, from about the period of the breaking up of the ice-sheet until near the close of the glacial winter.”</p>
<p>Other migrants, including hummingbirds, wood warblers, orioles, and tanagers, come from families that likely originated and evolved in the American tropics. In migrating south, these birds are returning to an ancestral home. They are, in the words of naturalist John Hay, birds in tune with planetary rhythms, “ancient claimants, with a profound sense of direction and internal ties to their natal sites.” Rudyard Kipling once divided men into two basic types, “those that stay at home and those that do not,” and the same might be said of birds. “Long-distance migrant species,” says John Kricher in <em>A Neotropical Companion</em>, “represent the relatively few that ventured northward into the temperate zone, extending their ranges, perhaps because the northern summer presents an abundance of proteinaceous insect resources for the rearing of young, longer days in which to feed, fewer predators, plus the availability of abundant nesting sites.” Hilty calls these species the “gamblers,” who, like human migrants, rolled the dice on their chances of finding a promised land, while the “conservatives” stayed home. Each strategy carries its own risks and rewards, if “strategy” is the word for it. Some Amazonian birds can’t adapt to the bright light outside tropical jungles, and some stay-at-home species are so instinctively agoraphobic that they won’t cross any body of water, even a river, much less fly 500 miles nonstop across the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some migrants push their luck so far that it’s hard to call it gambling at all. In Chile I was taken aback by the unmistakable tail flash of an American Redstart, a species far from its usual winter home and recorded only a few times in that country. It raised the unanswerable questions we often ask of vagrant birds: Why exactly did you come here? Did you feel wanderlust? If there are resources for you here, how did you know about them? Are you a pioneer, or are you just lost?</p>
<p>If a bird like the redstart, which breeds within a few miles of our house, is not one of “our” birds, then which birds are?  Well, the residents of course, the Black-capped Chickadee, the Downy Woodpecker, our all-weather New England comrades who suck it up, tough it out, snuggle to keep warm, and don’t flee south each year at the slightest hint of snowfall. These are our own conservatives, despite claims that conservatives are a rare breed in Massachusetts. But if we go by duration of stay or the usual human definitions of residency, we’d also have to include birds like the Snow Bunting, King Eider, and Harlequin Duck, Arctic breeders we call “winter visitors.” Whether they are visiting or returning home, they are as inseparable from coastal New England, as well-fitted to the habitats we offer, as the ducks, woodpeckers, and nuthatches that spend their whole lives here. Watch the Harlequin Ducks in December foraging in rough surf below a granite headland on Cape Ann, and you’ll see why they have been called North America’s only “torrent” duck. And the Snow Buntings, camouflaged on sand or patches of dirt, feeding beside dirty mounds of snow, are as much true New Englanders as the clamdiggers bent over on our mudflats in mid January.</p>
<p>If there’s pleasure in finding a local breeding bird in the tropics—a Wood Thrush on our doorstep in Belize—there’s a converse pleasure in seeing these “winter visitors” on their breeding grounds in the Arctic. When I went to Alaska a few years back, I wanted to find birds I’d never seen before—a Yellow-billed Loon, a Rhinocerous Auklet, or the legendary Bristle-thighed Curlew—but I was just as enthralled by birds I already knew. They were all decked out in their breeding plumage, the now yellow-billed Lapland Longspurs in stylish black ascots, and the phalaropes sporting vivid reds, not the drab garb they wear around Massachusetts. But it was more than that. A Long-tailed Jaeger, a species I’d seen in New England only far out to sea, was hundreds of miles from any ocean, hunting in a vast expanse of alpine tundra below Denali. The Harlequin Ducks were far inland as well, at a mountain stream—a stretch to call it a “torrent”—and one of them thought it was a Dipper, walking the stream as it searched the rocks for prey. The Buff-breasted Sandpipers, meanwhile, were just plain nuts, jerking around, wobbly as drunks, sidling up to blasé females to show off their sexy armpits. I realized I’d never known these birds at all. At most I’d glimpsed them. Their lives were strange, complex, and dramatic in ways I’d never imagined. “In a world older and more complete than our,” wrote Henry Beston about the mysterious synchronicity of migrating shorebirds, “they move finished and complete, gifted with extensions of the senses we have lost or never attained, living by voices we shall never hear. They are not brethren, they are not underlings, they are other nations.”</p>
<p>In fact, no birds are truly “our” birds. It’s not just that we don’t own them, though we may cage them, classify them, or name them as pets or scientific species. Birds may evoke feelings of familiarity, empathy, even intimacy, but they move through time at a pace, and with an intense adaptability to extreme shifts in their routines—most evident in their migrations—that gives their life histories a dynamic shape radically different from even the most peripatetic of human lives. Even the birds we can safely call neighbors, the New England loyalists, are “our” birds only for a time. Life, whether human or avian, is never static. The great forests of Canada, where many wood warblers and other migrants breed, have been called “boreal refugia,” but they are threatened now, as are many habitats in the world. In the scope of geological time, any refuge is transitory. My wife and I live with the chickadees on a granite hilltop, high above marshland, in no apparent danger of flooding, but this land was once under the ocean, with no chickadees in sight and no humans to watch them. Someday it will be under water again—in the long run, as part of glacial advance and retreat, or in the shorter run, through global warning. Whether or not our descendants are around to see them, there will be no chickadees in these parts to see, just as there will be no Baltimore Orioles in Baltimore, if there is still a Baltimore.</p>
<p>Yet in another sense, all birds are our birds, wherever they might be and whether or not we ever get a chance to see them. Ornithologist Chris Leahy says that all the individuals on earth—every person, bird, organism—share a “single ecosystem,” and this isn’t a mere figure of speech. Take, for instance, two bird species, far flung and seemingly unrelated. The Wrentit, neither wren nor tit but suggestive of both, is a solitary, sedentary bird of California chaparral and coastal scrub, a permanent resident, reluctant to fly and notorious for its refusal to stray far from home. The Cape Rock-jumper, a bird of rocky mountain slopes and scree, is endemic to a small range at the southern tip of South Africa. The two come from different families, live in different habitats on different continents, with different sources of food, and it’s safe to say they’ll never meet. But take one of their neighbors—a Little Blue Heron, a Ruddy Turnstone, or a Peregrine Falcon, all species found on almost every continent—and then move on to the neighbor’s various neighbors around the world, and it won’t take you six degrees of separation to connect the Wrentit and the rock-jumper, or any other two species, as well as most of the planet’s fauna and flora. They’re all interdependent, needing the same things to thrive, threatened in the same ways—by human encroachment, habitat destruction, invasive species. And they’re all our birds to the extent that we take a stake in them, whether they’re in California chaparral, South African scree, or the Mongolian steppes. It’s a question of how badly we want them to endure, for our grandchildren if you like, or simply because it would be a shame for such marvels to perish from the earth.</p>
<p>Next winter my wife and I plan to visit the Bahamas. I’d like to add a few species to my life list, like the Great Lizard Cuckoo, from a genus endemic to the West Indies, but I’m also hoping to find a Kirtland’s Warbler, a jack spine specialist that breeds only in a very restricted range in or near northern Michigan. Listed as endangered, the warbler is making a comeback because of efforts to preserve its breeding habitat and defend it against the nest parasitism of Brown-headed Cowbirds, but its survival depends just as much on preservation of habitat in its only known wintering grounds, the Bahamas and nearby Turks and Caicos. If I’m in luck, I’ll also see some old friends, like the Little Blue Herons that feed at a pond down the road from us, or the Pine Warbler that returns each April to our suet feeder and breeds in a pine grove behind our house, though I won’t know if I’m looking at the same bird. When spring comes to Massachusetts, I’ll look for these birds again, and those Eastern Bluebirds from Guatemala, for the pleasure of recognition and with worry about their welfare and a deeper appreciation of their struggles. They make me feel more rooted at home, yet connected to the places I’ve visited—marshes, mountains, and forests I won’t see again —along with the birds who share those places and the people who live among them.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the old woman with no upper lip tells you, in the Faubourg Marigny, that to pluck a crawfish from the bayou is akin to the tying of a silk scarf around one’s neck, that, as these little freshwater crustaceans asphyxiate in our air—the breeze of which carries sassafras and olive spread, desiccated peppers, powdered sugar, greenish decoctions called herbsaint and Mississippi, drizzle begetting rain begetting flood—their feathery gills flex, the twenty segments of their bodies clatter like castanets, their eye stalks extend, antennae dance, and, most importantly, she says, their sperm ducts roil, gonads quake, the females, releasing their aphrodisiac urine, flare their oviducts in anticipation the males’ reaching swimmerets, one desperate and futile stab at (literally) breathless procreation with, as is typical, a mere fishing net, or the unresponsive human hand, you believe her.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>When she tells you we all want one more go at ecstasy before the final smothering in the chocolate roux, the shellfish stock, the onion, the celery, the bell pepper, the garlic, she says, the butter, she says, the lemon, the cayenne, the thyme, you, hungry and horny, humid and sad, believe her.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Though the English translate etouffee as stifled, the French-speakers know better.  There’s more violence to it than that, more action, premeditation.  They know: etouffee means smothered, suffocated, the sort violence that’s allowed to titillate, that inspires us, here, to die with our genitals, like our lungs, gasping.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>You know, because the old woman tells you: Louisiana is just compacted sediment having washed down the Mississippi River.  No matter how much land, she says, no matter how high the walls, all that biota will get inside.  We’ve made a state here.  So many parishes.  But we can’t choke out the water.  You know, because she tells you: so many things living in the river drown in our air.  So many things, but the water itself.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Louisiana—literally Land of Louis—is named for Louis XIV, who, according to the old woman, may have said the world goes pink with buffoonery, billions of crawfish running away.  In their cheeks, the waterworms arrange themselves like dog stars.  And he may have been speaking of the visions as elicited by his penchant for autoerotic asphyxiation, some hallucinatory crawfish speaking equations into his fat ear that it would take only a stocking to solve.  And the old woman stares at her hands as a brass band starts their set in a bar up the street, shakes her head and whispers Canicula.  Ligature.  And you wonder about the fate of a place named for a king who took his orgasms without oxygen, if a name can bear a clairvoyance—if only of the meteorological kind, if, in Louisiana, is both a dish that reminds us of identifying fetishes, and the sort of weather that will sweep our houses, if not our breaths, away.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>I am going, Louis spoke on his deathbed in 1715, but the State shall always remain.  That his lips were slick with spittle, most historians can agree.  On whether he was speaking of this mass of compacted sediment, or of suffocation, or of the weather, or of orgasm, the jury’s out.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>We chop through our celery without thinking of Louis’ ribs.  Stir our roux dark and thick without thinking of all that riverbottom sludge collecting in so many throats.  In it, so nutrient-rich, in the bodies of the drowned, the Louisiana orchids still flourish.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>If we have the sexiest of flowers growing from our mouths, does that mean we can talk our lovers into the scarf, the stocking, the coital etouffee?</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>My own aunts saved themselves from drowning by hauling their bodies out onto enough of that sludge, the old woman says, undoing and redoing the clasp of her bracelet, the center of which bears an amulet of the Louisiana flag—a mother pelican crouching in her nest, staring down at her three chicks, their mouths begging at her bill.  And from her bill, three red droplets fall, the viscera of whatever she’s smothered to feed them.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>We stuff our mouths full of crawfish and take in a little less air.  Things, you think, taste better this way.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>If desperate, the pelican, the state bird, will prey on seagulls and ducklings, holding them underwater, drowning them, before eating them headfirst.  Unless the storm is too strong, they will open their bills and drink rainwater, their mouth-bags able to hold 13 liters at capacity—7 more than the human lung.   Beneath the pelican—on flag, on bracelet—whatever has been eaten looses its blood over words like Union, Justice, Confidence&#8230;, not a single one of which occurred to Louis as he shuddered like a crawfish into the stocking.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>&#8230;that sludge.  But they didn’t breathe for so long.  It affected their brains, their limbs.  They had to have their legs cut off&#8230;</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The swimmerets of the crawfish, laced along the ventral side of the abdomen, are often mistaken for shorter walking legs, though they are so much softer, used not only to carry sperm, but to carry the subsequently fertilized eggs.  When preparing our etouffee, these are the parts most of us cut from the body first, discard into the nethers of the muddying stock.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The tubas up the street crush themselves out like cigarettes.  When the saints are legless, she says, no one marches in.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>John Curra writes, “The carotid arteries (on either side of the neck) carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the brain. When these are compressed, as in strangulation or hanging, the sudden loss of oxygen to the brain and the accumulation of carbon dioxide can increase feelings of giddiness, light-headedness, and pleasure, all of which will heighten masturbatory sensations.”</p>
<p>And George Shuman writes, “When the brain is deprived of oxygen, it induces a lucid, semi-hallucinogenic state called hypoxia.  Combined with orgasm, the rush is said to be no less powerful than cocaine, and highly addictive.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Overheard dialogue in Coop’s Place on Decatur Street: “Oh my god, this etouffee is soooooo goooooood&#8230;”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Autoerotic asphyxiation was the first documented treatment used, in the 17th century, for erectile dysfunction, the idea having been bestowed upon witnesses to public hangings who noted that executed males often developed persistent “death erections,” and early morticians noted that females who were executed by hanging exhibited engorged labia.<br />
Peter Anthony Motteux, editor of Britain’s <em>The Gentlemen’s Journal</em>, died of autoerotic asphyxiation, as did the composer and virtuoso double-bassist Frantisek Kotzwara (who played for the King’s Theatre, and who, after a prostitute refused his request to cut off his testicles for two shillings, tied one end of a silk scarf to his neck and another to a doorknob, leading to a demise that the <em>American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology</em> could call only a “sticky end”), as did Kichizo Ishida (whose lover, Sada Abe, then excised his penis and testicles with a razor blade and infamously carried said souvenirs in her purse for weeks afterward), as did Stephen Milligan, British political conservative, as did David Carradine, and Reverend Gary Aldridge of the Thorington Road Baptist Church (who was discovered some 300 miles from New Orleans, hog-tied, wearing two wet suits, a head and face mask, diving gloves and flippers, and rubber underpants, and with a dildo the coroner called “modest” in his anus the coroner called “unremarkable”), and Michael Hutchence of the band INXS (whose death in 1997 inspired you to buy your own silk scarf, powder blue&#8230;).</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The old woman tells you that many crawfishermen uphold the superstition that a good etouffee depends on a good catch, and a good catch often depends on the superior quality of a single crawfish (not necessarily the largest, she stresses) who imposes this quality (sweetness, softness&#8230;) onto the remainder.  This one is often referred to as the <em>l&#8217;écrevisse super</em>, or Super Crawfish.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Long before it became the slogan of the U.S., Motteux used the phrase <em>E pluribus unum</em> as the motto for <em>The Gentlemen’s Journal</em>, translating it himself as “one chosen among many.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Though they’re not quite as snag-resistant as the football jig, many Louisiana crawfishermen still prefer the “traditional roundhead jig,” even along rocky bottoms.  Though you believe the connection to be tenuous at best, you can’t help your titillation when reading the “rocky bottom,” of Stephen Milligan’s obituary in <em>The Independent</em>, the last line of which reads, “If politicians can be divided into cavaliers and roundheads, Milligan was very much a roundhead.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>And Carradine said, “You know, I’ve never actually really believed that death is inevitable&#8230;there’s always an alternative.  There’s always a third way,” and Michael Hutchence said, as if in response, “We’d have to suck away at oxygen canisters&#8230;just so that we can keep playing.  I’m the smallest fish.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>And you hold your breath—right there on Frenchmen Street—in mimicry or empathy, and you know that in a lack of breathing is a rush of blood, is engorged, is a shattering, perhaps final, orgasm, and if something shatters, that means it’s broken.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>August 29, 2005, a Monday.  Some one thousand crawfish seep through a crack in the levee.  One of them is the smallest.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>In mimicry or empathy, the old woman sneezes twelve cherries of blood into a peach monogrammed handkerchief.  You don’t ask about the significance of the L and the A, the silver script initials that are trying so hard to be absorbent.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>When the female crawfish releases her urine, it drives the males into such a frenzy that, depending, it can be interpreted equally as an invitation to sex, or to battle.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Thomas Breithaupt, the behavioral psychologist, believes that the female crawfish is most able to gauge a male’s size and strength (read: his suitability as a mate) only by inspiring him to aggression.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Here, the Spanish killed the British who killed the French who killed the Acadians who killed the Creoles who killed the Plaquemines who killed the Caddoan Mississippians who killed the Tchefunctes who killed the earliest documented Archaic-period mound-building culture in North America, whose mounds still exist and have been variously interpreted by archaeologists as being a neighborhood, a trading center, and a ceremonial religious complex, and perhaps it’s because we can’t determine exactly what this place is, or perhaps it’s because we think this may be the earliest example of a civil war battleground, or perhaps the earth here has been so compacted that when we press our lips to it, we can siphon no air, or perhaps it’s because there are no crawfish here, or perhaps it’s because the old woman tells you those who have the money needn’t worry about the water, or perhaps it’s something else that inspired us to name this historic monument, Poverty Point.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>&#8230;which the hallucination?</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>You know, because the old woman tells you: The batons of Baton Rouge are red because there’s blood on them.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Here, we call our counties, parishes.  That doesn’t mean that our food is always incantatory, our sex lives bored, ecclesiastic.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Because of this weather, this history, we smother our water-dwellers with the good land vegetables.  In this way, we retain the breath required to blow our etouffee cool enough to stuff our mouths.  In this way, we fight back.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>We serve it over rice—anything to soak up the roux, the sludge, the agent of the smothering.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The Hurricane, the old woman tells you, wiped out two-thirds of the city’s trees.  Certain wards lost every one.  You imagine the trees she once told fortunes under—the Southern magnolias and live oaks, the Cherrybarks and Sawtooths, the Overcups and Cows—trees you will never get to see.  In the aftermath of The Hurricane, she tells you, in regards to the decimation of New Orleans’ urban forest, Tom Campbell, spokesperson for the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry, summed it up with all of the gentility a non-native Louisianan could never muster: “It looks like the dickens,” he said.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Winding among the above-ground vaults of St. Louis Cemetery Number One—so many thousands in just one square block—you watch a group of congregants alternately grieve and celebrate.  So many bury their faces into the necks of their loved ones, take in, for just a moment, no air—as if, in a momentary lack of oxygen is an honoring of the sort of sadness that, if left unchecked, if taken out of context, can kill us too.  Another vault, so little room&#8230;</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>You watch the congregants—mothers and fathers and sons and daughters and aunts, uncles, cousins, grand-this and grand-that.  There is something huge about them, and uniform—in their clothing, their grieving, their once-in-a-while laughs.  They accumulate like clouds, and you speak this aloud as if incantation: You accumulate like clouds.  Though you’re not exactly sure what it is you’re trying to summon, you do know that, taxonomically, crawfish belong Astacoidea and Parastacoidea, and you know that these classifications are known as “superfamilies,” and you want to interpret this as something as heroic as the weather, but you know it has more to do with prefix, dominance, missionary, on top of&#8230;</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>What else can we do to secure our place here than to make of the super the sub, the meat over which we spoon the thickest of our sauces?</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>You watch them stifle their crying.  You wonder about the intersections of grief and sex, grief and the body, the body and violence, the hanged man and the hanged woman, the poor beast who doesn’t know whether to fuck or to fight, who carries its eggs in its softest, safest parts, who drowns so we can eat.  You wonder about the parts of us to which so much blood rushes when we die by asphyxiation, as if searching a blind alley for any escape.  You wonder which role the weather plays.  The earth, you think, is the mouth-bag.  The old woman would like that, would say something constellar about all of these faces smothered in all of these necks.  As ever, it’s the neck that does the smothering.  As ever, and ever-odd, we’re hung by these parts of us and our pants and our dresses can do nothing but jump up.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Like the crawfish, we sometimes don’t want to be heard.  If the weather—like Louis, like Land of Louis, like St. Louis, like the comforted and comforting in St. Louis Number One, like all things for whom our homes are named—can’t hear us, maybe they won’t find us.  Like the crawfish, like every lover really, we wonder if we’re not breathing, enough.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Sicko! Weirdo!”</p>
<p>A moment of silence. Then the young woman started over.</p>
<p>She was in the observation room, to the north of the day room. It was where they put the worst patients when they first came in, people who screamed and shouted, or who had tried to kill themselves.  Her yelling continued. I could hear it while I washed my face, went to eat breakfast, and then sat with the others in the day room. No one could read the paper for all her loud desperation, “Sicko!  Weirdo!” We didn’t know what to think, and I could feel the embarrassment in the room.  We glanced sideways at each others’ eyes.</p>
<p>I watched people coming and going from the little room. At first there had been only the nighttime M.D. and the nighttime nurses, because she had been admitted just past midnight. Later the psychiatrist, Dr. Scotland, visited her; and the day nurses filed in and out. I wondered if they were trying to comfort her, or if they were just dispassionately observing, or if they were drugging her.</p>
<p>Then the rest of us were called to group.  Held in a large room at the end of the hall, morning group was usually devoted to pointless accusations by patients about staff and breakfast food, as well as the “events” of the previous night, like a patient’s noisy outburst, or the unpleasantness of the orderly’s flashlight checks. That day we could think of nothing to say &#8212; we just sat there and squirmed and listened to that yelling.  We were annoyed by her, and lacked any compassion.  Some of the old ladies muttered about her, “I wonder if she came in here on drugs,” and “I don’t know what she’s been up to, and it makes me nervous.” But eventually the yelling petered out.  We spent the rest of the morning, after group, in little circles in the day room, chatting, doing our assigned household tasks (mine was caring for the many plants), and being forced by the occupational therapist to exercise and then to make stupid things in crafts class that we could keep if we wanted.  That day, since it was fall, we made little corn-husk dolls.  I am an artist, so I found folding corn husks into doll shapes less offensive than the exercising.The day room was shining white, an enamel white, as were the halls, the group room, and our bedrooms.  It seemed to me that they should have painted them a soothing pastel.  Back when I was in the observation room myself, weeks before, the sheer gleam of the white began to shimmer.  It overwhelmed me, and I retreated far away, into the blackness of my mind, which expanded to welcome the Evil Ones.  They had traveled from the farthest galaxy in the universe, surrounded by ultimate blackness, 200 billion light-years away.  They slid right into my mind and curled up.  But each day, the medicine the nurses gave me made the Evil Ones slip out, one by one, and recede back, farther and farther, toward their own galaxy.  In the perversity of psychosis, I missed them, and I would have traveled outward from my black brain toward the surface of my skin, out to follow them; but the medications prevented my voyage.  I hated the medicine Dr. Scotland had prescribed as much as I was grateful for it.</p>
<p>After a while, I was put out with the other people.  I began to notice my fellow patients and the nurses, to chat with them, to learn their names.  Eventually I even made a friend &#8212; the young woman.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">She was brought in to lunch. She had to be led. Not because she was drugged, but because she was blind. She <em>tap, tap, tapped</em> her way down the hall, measuring its length and width with her cane so that she would know them for the stay that was ahead. She had a big smile.</p>
<p>She was put at the head of the table. She didn’t wear sunglasses, and seemed to have control over her eyes, like she’d gone to a really good school for the blind, that had taken care of every detail. This young woman looked stunningly like Liberace, with the same high, thick, black hair and sweetened smile. She was about thirty, like me.  I could not take my own eyes off her. Blindness has always stabbed me in the heart: I know for a fact that the eyes are the major escape route from the blackness.  I would rather be dead than blind.  Well, maybe she would, too.  Maybe, I thought, that’s why she’s here.</p>
<p>Her name was Faith.</p>
<p>She was an expert at the table. She patted her food softly with her fingertips to determine what were meat, vegetables, noodles, and so forth. Faith buttered her own roll. “No thank you, I don’t need any help at all.  I know how to pour cream into coffee, just the right amount – watch me!”   All the while, she was thoroughly tidy, leaving no stain, no crumb.</p>
<p>I was mesmerized.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p>She was led to the group room for our afternoon session. The nurse pointed things out to her – “The bay windows are here, notice how they jut out,” and “The most comfortable couches are on this side of the room.”  A low, circular coffee table covered with magazines sat in the middle of the room – “Be careful, it’s quite wide.”  The sweetened, Liberace smile never left her face.</p>
<p>Tall, ruddy Dr. Scotland said to the group, “This is Faith.  She joined the ward early this morning.  Faith, would you like to say a few words about yourself and why you are here?”</p>
<p>Her voice was low, articulated, and melodious – I was reminded that the sound of a voice would naturally mean more to her, not seeing, than to us.  “I have three small children.  Two are in elementary school.  My younger son is still at home with me. I care for my children, keep my house, and cook the meals.”</p>
<p>Patients looked at each other, amazed.</p>
<p>But she wasn’t through.  “I’m a graduate of Drake University, I’ve been to Europe, and I can water-ski.” All of a sudden, she started yelling again, building up a crescendo to “Sicko!  Weirdo!”</p>
<p>Then silence. She put her head down low and grasped her stick in front of her like a pillar.</p>
<p>The rest of us turned to reciting our respective trivia and to bickering.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p>Days are almost identical there, until you leave. I do not remember which days I learned what about Faith. Over meals at the long table and during day trips in the van and free time in the day room (where Faith knitted as she talked) we became close friends, although she only gradually got beyond the sharing of facts. She had so many facts.</p>
<p>For instance, Faith baked bread. Although blind, she measured the margarine, the sugar, the flour, all the little ingredients, stirred them, greased the right-sized pan, somehow preheated the oven to the correct temperature, timed the bread, tested it to determine if it was done, took it out of the oven without getting burned, and, amazingly, cleaned and tidied her kitchen afterward. She had learned to use a Braille cookbook at the school for the blind in Des Moines, where she had spent her youth.</p>
<p>Faith never stopped talking about her blindness. I wondered if it was always the fact in every blind person’s existence.  It was in hers.</p>
<p>“I’m an only child,” she said.  “My parents were quite old when I was born. They’ve told me over and over how long they’d hoped for a child.”  She was premature and had barely survived.  She had exchanged her sight for her life. I wondered inwardly if she had actually been able to see for the first day or two or three of her life, before her retinas failed, and God had not allowed her to remember it.</p>
<p>One day as I passed her room, I saw she was sitting on the edge of her perfectly made bed. I went in, said hello, and glanced around. Her clothes were color-coordinated by Braille code stickers and hung on the hooks near the sink. Faith was reading a huge, white Braille book &#8212; it was Psalms, she said, smiling up at me.  “No, you’re not interrupting,” she added.  I sat down on her bed beside her, and we got to talking almost immediately about her parents.  She seemed more concerned with them than she was with her husband, who’d just left her and &#8212; she had shrieked &#8212; molested their daughter.  I thought, she must be very ill to be so disordered about her priorities.  So I sat back and listened, to try to make sense of her tale.  “After I was born and I was blind, my parents devoted their lives to me.  They’ve given me every advantage possible. I’ve even had private ballet lessons.”  She wore a magnificent ring, an opal surrounded by diamonds, on her right hand, a gift from them. “They still live next door to me.”</p>
<p>She was angry at them, very angry.  She wanted her freedom, but they would not leave her alone. “My parents are worried about what’s going to happen to me when they’re dead.   Well, they are old, and my husband has left me.”  Faith wanted only to be away from her parents.  “I said I’d move here to Ames, but they said they would move too!  What do you think of my becoming a court reporter?  That way I could support myself.”  I pointed out the long schooling and transportation logistics involved.  What else could she do?  In the time I knew her, she returned again and again to this, the central dilemma of her life: how to gain freedom, how to be in control.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p>Faith went to morning and afternoon groups on her own, although one or another of us would often remind her when she was approaching the big, round coffee table, or one of the old ladies would say, “Oh, come sit by me, dear, there’s an empty place right here by me.” She would nestle in and sit there with her head held high, giving one the impression she, too, could see. She was inevitably the center of the group. Each session was the same: Faith would start it with an angry remark seemingly out of the blue, like “My mother criticizes the way I vacuum, and she checks the tops of my picture frames to see if I’ve dusted properly!”</p>
<p>Dr. Scotland said, “Do you think that’s really true, Faith?”</p>
<p>“They’re monsters!”</p>
<p>“You’re thirty years old: do you think your mother is really a monster?”</p>
<p>Faith would turn to stone, head held high, with that sweetened smile.</p>
<p>I looked around: judging from their expressions, I didn’t think anyone believed the business about the tops of the picture frames, or that parents like hers could be so awful.<br />
Then each session Dr. Scotland would stare at her sternly, and say, “I’m told you refuse to take your medications.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s true.  I want to be in control.”</p>
<p>She would be silent for the rest of group.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p>The locked psychiatric ward was the top floor of the four-story hospital.  On the ground floor was a gift shop.  The corridors of the little hospital were hung with paintings by local artists, all for sale.  I was allowed to leave the ward in order to look at the paintings, perhaps because the staff knew I was an artist and seeing them would somehow be therapeutic.  The gift shop itself was fun, too, with its figurines, dried flower arrangements, and little boxes of toiletries.</p>
<p>One day Faith asked the head nurse if she could go with me, to hear descriptions of watercolors and engravings and to learn what was in the gift shop.  When she got permission, we left the ward and worked our way through the pictures, from floor to floor.  It was a pleasure to describe precisely what I saw.  Faith liked the pictures, but loved the gift shop.  She came alive as she walked among all the people: an enthusiasm presented itself in her that I had not previously witnessed.  After carefully touching things all over the room, she struck up an animated conversation with the director of the gift shop, who was amazed at Faith’s ability to maneuver the narrow aisles of merchandise and become acquainted with the gifts.  They stood at the cashier’s counter, and all of a sudden an excited Faith said, “I can do that!  I could volunteer here as a cashier.  It would be easy to learn the register, and to scan the things people wanted to buy!’</p>
<p>“Yes, you know, I think you could,” the director said.  “Do you think you’d like to volunteer here?”</p>
<p>“I could, as soon as I’m discharged and back home.  My mother could drive me here so that I could be a cashier.  Imagine that: a cashier!  Maybe I could turn it into a real job eventually…”</p>
<p>They exchanged contact information as I stood there dumbfounded.  The mother she so resented was to drive her here so that she could have one more accomplishment.  No, to seize upon a serendipitous chance to eventually become self-sufficient.  She would take any chance at anything to achieve self-sufficiency.  She would never stop.  She couldn’t stop.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p>I was well enough by then to have passes for walks in the neighborhood, and Faith was allowed to go along with me. It was fall in the Midwest, a harvest of leaves on the ground to shuffle through, and exciting air all by itself worth being in Iowa for. Faith tapped through the wanton piles of leaves. “Oh, tell me their colors,” she said.  She picked some up herself and examined their textures, smells, and shapes. She asked me to describe the houses, children, and dogs and cats we passed.</p>
<p>On one of these walks she told me a little about her husband, whose name I forgot many years ago. Art had been a theme of their lives together. “We met at Drake, in my Introduction to Art class.”  (“The only really hard part was the color wheel,” Faith added; incredibly, she had received a “B” in the course.)  “We were so in love.  When we were first married, on our kitchen table he cut out big cardboard letters of your alphabet for me to hold and feel with my fingertips.”  He had been there with her when a teacher of the blind had taught her, working with crayon on an easel, about perspective and hence far-off depth&#8211;such a profound, joyous discovery, the next best thing to seeing with her eyes. I thought back to when I’d been able to see into the farthest depths of the universe, to find a galaxy on its most remote edge.  But I hadn’t really seen it, or seen the Evil Ones &#8212; not with my eyes.  I’d realized them in the blackness, been palpably aware of them.  Faith’s mind, on the other hand, had formed – while she held crayon to easel &#8212; an actual image: a house in perspective, a horse at the far end of a fenced meadow, an airplane landing on a runway.</p>
<p>Now her nine-year-old daughter was, she said, in art therapy to draw her feelings about her father molesting her. “It is the most dreadful thing in the world!” shrieked Faith in the middle of the sidewalk, “Sicko!  Weirdo!”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p>One day she began to talk about her husband in our morning group; but Dr. Scotland, oddly, chose that moment to change tactics.  “I will hear no more from you until you begin taking your medications,” he announced. It was almost showdown time.  But instead, he looked at her for a long moment, turned his head to the old woman I shared my room with, and asked her how she felt. “I’m glad to say,” she began, “that I’m feeling a little better.  It’s the pills you’re giving me.  I am so grateful to you.”</p>
<p>But all of us really wanted to know about the new young man in the room.  Physically, he was unremarkable – tall, thin, tan-haired.  He’d been brought in about midnight, by two policemen.  He’d just stood there without making a sound.  Then he spent the night on a cot in the nurses’ station.  He was a freshman from the local university, overwhelmed by what had happened to his roommate. That roommate had considered himself a coward because he was afraid of heights and had decided to take up sky diving to defeat his fear. He’d actually gone up in the small plane but had not been able to jump. Humiliated, he decided to cure himself once and for all of his fear by climbing through the window of their dorm room onto the foot-wide ledge outside it. He either slipped or lost his balance and fell fourteen stories.  We’d seen the story on the news the night before.</p>
<p>His stunned roommate was the boy in group with us.  He sort of told us this story, but Dr. Scotland helped him out a lot.  Afterwards, he just sat silently.  When group was over, he stayed in the room, lost in thought. The staff let him be.  Eventually he moved into the day room, where he settled into a big armchair and thought.  We would glance at him as we went about our business.   His expression went from lost and old, to strained and hard, to the softness of a college student who’d seen horror.  He thought his way out to where he could see and hear and touch again, and know that the people around him were alive.  He spent the day with us; then after a long, quiet talk with Dr. Scotland the next morning, he left with his parents.</p>
<p>Looking back after all these years, I wonder (hypothetically, of course) whether Faith would choose to see, if by that it was meant she could see only what that young man saw.  Is seeing hell better than seeing nothing?</p>
<p>I suspect knowing her choice wouldn’t be broadly useful – except for understanding better what she was like – because probably the choice would vary from person to person.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p>Like everybody else there, Faith had to have a small task on the ward. “Since you love all the plants so much, take my job, and I’ll clean the snack closet every day,” I volunteered. Faith watered beautifully, like gardeners who examine the soil with their fingers. She knew many of the plants by name. I wondered if somewhere, from her color-wheel days, Faith had any notion of their combinations of green and yellow and brown shades.</p>
<p>Our daily friendship included chats in my room when my roommate was gone. Sitting on my bed, Faith confided, “I can’t tell you how dreadful it is raising small children when you’re blind &#8212; the children make fun of you, hide from you, run away from you, taunt you.  They probably even make faces.  I was desperate when I found out I was pregnant with my third child.  And, I suppose, that’s when my troubles really began.”</p>
<p>Faith’s troubles.  It was always Faith’s troubles.  The only other person in her life she seemed at all concerned about was her daughter.  She didn’t ask about or comment on the troubles of any of us.  Suddenly, I realized that she hadn’t had any reaction to the story of the young man whose roommate had fallen off the dormitory ledge.  Of course, the reason was right there – Faith was on her own ledge, and she couldn’t see, in any sense of the word, hands reaching out to save her.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p>The occupational therapist announced at breakfast that we would all be going to Des Moines to see the Botanical Gardens that afternoon.  Faith and I were excited – “More plants for us!” we exclaimed together. It was a grand fall afternoon to be driving through farmland. On the trip in the van, Faith had me describe the houses, barns, cows, cornfields, silos, tractors, white fences, all the richness and general prosperity, all the way to Des Moines.</p>
<p>For a splendid moment, in the Botanical Gardens, Faith was on her own.  She touched plants, rolled both long and round leaves between her fingers, examined smooth and fibrous stems, and smelled all the variously colored flowers. I stared at Faith rather than at the plants. Then I bent over and became absorbed in watching the school of little blue fish in the moat beyond the front row of plants.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I heard that familiar pressed yelling, but this time it was, “Help me! Oh help me!” I got up and ran to her. At the second turn of the pebbled path, she had come upon the cactus garden. Then she had gotten down on her knees to examine the bed of miniature cacti in the front. She had touched them, and the tiny spines had become imbedded in the fingertips of both her hands. She turned to me like a child to her mother, tears in her eyes, moaning softly. I held her fingers, looked closely.  The spines were microscopic &#8212; I could see them no better than Faith. I had touched this kind of cactus myself once, years before, and I still remembered the pain of the invisible spines imbedded everywhere on the undersides of my fingers.</p>
<p>In the lavatory, we washed her fingers over and over, which helped a bit.  But Faith still moaned – she was in terrible shape.  She had no reserves, none, for even the most inconsequential pain. She rested her head on my shoulder on the return trip; but after we got back, she did not leave her room for the rest of the day.  The times I passed by, I saw her at the sink, washing her hands.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p>The next morning’s group was, it turned out, showdown time for Faith. At first we talked for a few moments about the feeble suicide attempt with aspirins of an adolescent who’d just come in; and then Dr. Scotland asked Faith outright, “Why are you here?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Why are you here?”</p>
<p>The old ladies looked at each other, frightened.  The adolescent who’d taken the aspirins was confused and looked down at his feet.</p>
<p>“Why won’t you take your medications?” Dr. Scotland pressed on.</p>
<p>Faith turned stately: “I will NOT relinquish control of my mind.”</p>
<p>“If you don’t take your medications, you’re going to have to leave.”</p>
<p>Faith began to smile like Liberace.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p>At lunch, she was no longer at the head of the table.  Her parents had been called, and they had come to get her.</p>
<p>I went to Dr. Scotland with a heavy heart. “If only I could have said something.” I stared at the floor.</p>
<p>He surprised me by peeking out of his sternness. “She probably wouldn’t have heard you through her anguish,” he replied.</p>
<p>I had not thought of that.</p>
<p>“But why does she need medications?” I asked him.  She’s not like me, with creatures inside her head.  And she’s not like somebody who’s going 90 miles an hour.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your opinion.”</p>
<p>He left, and I felt like kicking a chair.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p>Three days later Faith was back at the table when I went to lunch. “My father,” she explained after we hugged, “tried to treat me with Valium &#8212; he’s a retired doctor.   But my body started turning numb.”</p>
<p>In afternoon group Dr. Scotland told her immediately that, if she still refused to take her medication, he was going to send her to the state mental hospital.</p>
<p>“It’s going to take you a long time to get well without medication,” he said. “They’re prepared to keep you there for a long time.”</p>
<p>Faith was silent, but terrified. She just sat there, staring straight ahead.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p>Days passed, and Dr. Scotland eased up on her in group &#8212; I guess she did start taking her medications. Faith was pretty well gone from everyone then – the old ladies, the nurses, Dr. Scotland.  She had nothing to say to me except, “I’m going to be just fine now, you wait and see!”  Then she’d give me her Liberace smile and tap, tap away down the hall.   She spent her time in her room, with her Bible. She was there almost every minute she was not required to be somewhere else, reading with her fingertips, reading, late into the night, no lights on in her room.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p>One morning Dr. Scotland took me aside before breakfast and said, “I want to praise you for your compliance with treatment.  I realize you were ambivalent at first.”  I didn’t know if he understood that, if I’d had a real choice in the matter, at the beginning I would rather have followed the Evil Ones homeward to their galaxy.  But now, thanks to my medications, the Evil Ones had been stripped of their power, didn’t even appear to me, except in the vaguest of memory.</p>
<p>Soon after that I was discharged.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p>My lasting image of Faith is a woman broken and still fighting on the ground, unable to rise to defend herself except by mustering failed tactics, the only ones she knew.  Her life proved, tragically, that it was not enough to be best at everything.  She could not accept that she’d gotten as much control of her life as she ever could or would.  Faith was courageous, competitive, heroic.  She deserved more than being just medicated, if in fact she needed pills at all.  She deserved long, quiet talks with someone of wisdom who could mop away her vast tears.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p>Faith and I exchanged addresses, of course, and phone numbers.  She called me in hysteria from her house six months after I left the ward.  There was no gist to what she said, and I could not find any of the words she needed to hear.   After that, we never got in touch again.  The fact is, I have never heard of a long friendship coming from such a place.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was a bright, moonlit Sunday night on March 14, 1966, when Frank Mannor’s dogs began barking frantically. Frank and his nineteen-year-old son Ronnie went outside their ramshackle farmhouse to investigate.  In the distance they saw lights and a faint red glow, “like a cigarette being smoked,” and set off over the rolling farmland to investigate. Frank thought that perhaps a meteorite had crashed nearby, and hoped to find some fragments. Instead, what he and Ronnie saw hovering about eight feet above the swampy ground was an oval object about the length of a car, with a hump in the middle and a light at either end. Its surface was textured and rough, “like coral rock.”  As Frank and Ronnie got closer, the entire object glowed red. Then it went dark. When the pair got to the spot where they’d seen it, the object was gone.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, back in the house, Frank’s wife, Leona, called the police department in  nearby Dexter, Michigan. Three Dexter policemen and two Washtenaw County deputy sheriffs sped to the scene, along with dozens of nearby residents who’d heard about the sightings via the Mannors’ eight-household party line.</p>
<p>I wish I could say that I remember hearing their sirens that night. I don’t, but I could have from our house, halfway between the college town of Ann Arbor and the farming hamlet of Dexter.</p>
<p>Though Frank never saw the object take off, the policemen did. They reported that it made sweeps in the air about 1000 feet up &#8212; “like a pendulum,” one said &#8212; its lights flashing, first white, then red. As it zipped through the sky, the witnesses described it as sounding like a ricocheting bullet, others like the keening of an ambulance. And most reported seeing three other similar objects join it, then all fly off in a tight formation.  Washtenaw County Sheriff Doug Harvey ordered all available deputies to the scene. Six patrol cars, two men in each, and three detectives surrounded the area and eventually chased a flying object along Island Lake Road without catching it.</p>
<p>At around 1:00 AM, William Van Horn, a civil defense director, and dozens of students watched an object matching Mannors’ description swoop, hover, and fly near the University of Michigan campus, a nearby airport and a local swamp. Starting at 3:50 AM, the Washtenaw County’s Sheriff’s Department started getting calls from sheriff’s deputies in Livingston and Monroe counties saying that they were seeing a formation of four flying objects diving, rising, and flying at fantastic speeds. The Livingston County officials were in turn receiving phone calls from local citizens reporting the same. The Monroe County officials called Selfridge Air Base, northeast of Detroit, and were told that they’d detected some objects over Lake St. Clair, but were unable to identify them. “The Air Base called Detroit Operations and were to call this Dept. back as to the disposition,” the Washtenaw County Sheriff’s Department log notes, but apparently no call ever came.</p>
<p>For the next seven days, people saw these UFOs again in and around Dexter, Ann Arbor, and the small town of Milan, Michigan. Professor J. Allen Hynek, a Northwestern University astrophysicist who consulted with the military, was sent to Dexter to investigate. “He came into my office,” Sheriff Doug Harvey recounted forty years later. “We went out to the site where supposedly this object came down on the ground. Dr. Hynek in the car said, &#8216;There is something. We just can&#8217;t put our finger on it. We&#8217;ve been investigating this for quite a while. ” After speaking with Frank and Robbie Mannors and tromping through the area where they claimed to have seen the object land, Hynek and Harvey returned to Harvey’s office. Hynek went to a private room to make a phone call to Washington, D.C. When he emerged, his uncertainty had vanished.</p>
<p>“It’s swamp gas,” he announced.</p>
<p>Mannors was outraged. He’d been in the army in Louisiana, he said, and seen swamp gas often. This wasn’t swamp gas. But Hynek stuck to his story, and though there continued to be reports of UFO sightings in southeastern Michigan through the next two years, they became more infrequent and suspect.</p>
<p>Still, sitting on the damp grass on late spring nights in 1968, my first year of high school, my friends and I would scan the sky in a hopeful search for unearthly objects.</p>
<p>“Okay, so assuming there are intelligent beings out there, why in God’s name would they come here?” Jeff asked. Though some mistook his tone for arrogance, Jeff was so much smarter than most people that he was just perpetually astonished at what came out of their mouths. “For the weather?”</p>
<p>“Maybe they’re just being neighborly,” Diana offered, “like Andy Griffith. You know, ‘Howdy, friend. Welcome to the galaxy.’”</p>
<p>“Oh, so we should just open the door to the planet, invite them in, and offer them meatloaf?”</p>
<p>Diana looked at me in amazement. “Meatloaf?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that what you Americans eat? Okay, what, cookies? A beer?”</p>
<p>“Maybe they came to borrow some sugar,” she mused.</p>
<p>“Or maybe they came to be taken to our leaders so they could haul their dumb,<br />
war-mongering asses to another planet.” Though capable of humor, John rarely displayed it.</p>
<p>“Seriously, why would aliens come here, to this planet?” Jeff persevered. “For water? To take specimens?”</p>
<p>“Maybe we’re the only intelligent life forms around, besides them,” I offered.</p>
<p>“God, that’s frightening.”</p>
<p>“They’re much more likely to be some new kind of low-flying bomber or surveillance plane,” John, his deep voice at odds with his slight physique, doggedly stayed on track. “The kind of thing the government will never admit to.”</p>
<p>“Spy-o-rama,” Diana said. She’d recently taken to adding “o-rama” to a wide array of nouns and verbs. I thought she was incredibly witty.</p>
<p>“Maybe they’ve come to watch television?” Jeff offered.</p>
<p>John elaborated. “Maybe watching us is like watching television, like flipping between war movies and Green Acres.”</p>
<p>Diana dreamily suggested, “Maybe they’ve come for a delicious Stuckey’s Pecan Log Roll.”</p>
<p>In Diana and Jeff and John and a handful of other smart, irreverent, and highly political kids, I’d finally found my people. We’d all come from somewhere else; none of us had lived in Ann Arbor for more than five years. We all deplored violence, hated the war, smoked just a little pot, scorned our dim and ancient teachers, mistrusted our young and “relevant” ones, and made damn sure to do well in school nonetheless. Jeff read Alan Watts, Diana read Borges, John read science fiction tomes, and I was enamored of Anais Nin. (Though I’m now the writer, they had much better taste.) And though it wasn’t something any of us had aspired to, we’d been catapulted from outcast status in our respective junior highs to being in the cool kids in high school.</p>
<p>My house, situated on a hill at the end of a dirt road outside of town, had become our default gathering spot, though “house” is an exaggeration. My parents and brother and I lived in the large, bottom floor of a home that an antique dealer, Leroy Darwin, had built for his wife, Mary Lou, just before divorcing her. She lived on the upper floor with their five-year-old daughter, Vicky Lou, whose name she pronounced “Vickaloo,” as if she was an Indian dish. We had only one other house within sight, occupied by Lew and Judy and their daughter, Vicky Lynn, who was also five and could have been Vicky Lou’s brown-eyed twin.</p>
<p>My mother had furnished the apartment with items bought at auction – a giant oak dining room table that doubled as a desk, a giant green leather wing-backed chair, a ramshackle wooden tea cart that my father repainted the color of a tired winter sky. Because the house was built into a hill, the basement had sliding glass doors in the living room, flanked by two life-size ceramic chickens. From the Turkish-print couch, we looked out on a lawn so large that Leroy had to mow it in his tractor. “Lawn,” too, is a bit misleading. It was really just a sloping field with a giant uncultivated meadow to the right of it. The incline was so steep and the patch of trees at the base so dense that when my mother’s 1963 Dodge Dart slipped out of gear, it rolled down the hill and was so thoroughly swallowed by the trees that she reported it as stolen.  The police came, but it was  Leroy who discovered it several days later on his final pass across the lawn.</p>
<p>Forty miles from the Motor City, practically every high school kid with a license also had  a car, and since neither of my parents got home until dinner time, my friends were there most days after school.  With its rural setting and oddball décor, with its abundance of stereo equipment courtesy of my Uncle Herbie and big starry sky outside, that house was the perfect incubator for our emerging sensibility. We were attuned to all that was ironic and all that was deplorable; we loved to ponder the Big Questions and to mock ourselves for doing so.</p>
<p>Our generally absentee landlord, Leroy, a wiry, belligerent guy, was an up-and-comer with the foresight to buy up big tracts of undeveloped land in anticipation of Ann Arbor’s suburban sprawl. He made it clear at every opportunity that he hated Commie hippies, and our neighbor, Lew, was only slightly more tolerant of the long-haired, bell-bottomed peaceniks traipsing in and out of our house.</p>
<p>But their wives were curious. A farm girl from Dexter, now installed in her husbandless house on the hill and living on alimony payments whose generosity reflected Leroy’s desire to show what a big man he was, Mary Lou seemed perpetually baffled about what she was supposed to do. Judy, a townie from Ann Arbor, was as down-to-earth as Mary Lou was dazed.  Out in the sticks, stuck at home with Vicky Lou and Vicky Lynn all day, the two of them would whip up big batches of Snickerdoodle cookies and bring them to us as at dusk. They’d tap on the sliding glass doors when my friends and I were hanging out in the living room, then come in bearing mass quantities of deviled eggs on platters adorned with pastel-colored crepe paper. On weekends or late at night, they’d randomly offer us limp hot dogs in Wonder Bread buns. I realize now that they weren’t much older than us, and perhaps a bit envious of … what? Our unencumbered state? Our certainty? At times, it seemed what they really coveted was our knowledge.</p>
<p>“The South Vietnamese people don’t want us there,” I’d earnestly explain. “This war is being fought for the benefit of Dow Chemical and Bank of America, not for us.”<br />
“Yeah, and the South Vietnamese government is a puppet regime. They’ve slaughtered thousands of their own people,” John would elaborate.</p>
<p>Mary Lou would brush back her hair with a flour-coated hand, and look at us with wide gray eyes. “Really? That’s terrible,” she’d say, with exactly the same tone of genuine distress as I’d told her that we were out of butter.</p>
<p>Judy was more skeptical.  “Who gave you the inside scoop?” she’d ask between drags on her Virginia Slim cigarette. But she wouldn’t listen to our answers; she was more interested in who was singing on that record we were listening to, or why Diana would want to leave Michigan for San Francisco, or how much a nickel bag of pot actually cost. She wasn’t wowed by our worldliness, but she knew privilege when she saw it, and wanted to understand it better.</p>
<p>We already had a well-defined sense of Us and Them by the middle of our high school careers. Leroy, with his bristly crew cut and <em>America: Love it or Leave It</em> sticker emblazoned on the bumper of his Oldsmobile Cutlass, was Them. Sheriff Harvey, with his football player physique and practice of busting hippy panhandlers and cutting off their hair before releasing them from jail (or what the underground press referred to as “Harvey’s Pigsty”) the next morning, was Them. The farmers of Dexter, with their limp and faded American flags hanging over sagging porches and their lack of outrage at their own poverty – they were Them.</p>
<p>But our neighbors Mary Lou and Judy and the two Vicky’s in their tow-headed wildness, were harder to silo. When Vicky Lou started first grade, Mary Lou decided to get out of the house. She enrolled in a poetry class at Washtenaw Community College, and took up with the professor who taught it. He was blind, but had once been sighted. His mass of curly hair and thick, droopy mustache seemed cultivated to resemble Kurt Vonnegut. Only the dark glasses derailed the overall look.  Mary Lou took obvious delight in driving him around town with the top down on her rust-colored Mustang convertible. I’d babysit some nights so she could go out with him, and when they’d come home, she’d insist that I stay and have a glass of wine, then listened with a stillness that may have been fascination, but more likely sleepiness, as he and I talked about whether <em>Catch-22</em> was the new <em>Catcher in the Rye</em>. She was the only non-jerk in the kitchen on those nights.</p>
<p>Sometimes after Vicky Lou had gone to sleep, Mary Lou would join us as we lay on that vast mowed lawn, gazing up at the sky. And one night, our vigilance almost paid off. A bluish-white disc of light appeared on the horizon at around 8 pm, arcing upward until it was almost overhead, then dropping back down. At first we were mystified, then excited. But the dim and fuzzy light was just that – light – seemingly without mass. Bored within minutes, Jeff concluded that it couldn’t be a UFO, so we went inside to drink hot chocolate and listen to the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. The ever-so-slight mystery of the light would be solved the next day when we learned that a new car dealer on Plymouth Road had set up a searchlight to attract people from the tri-county area to see the great new selection of 1969 Chevrolets for themselves.</p>
<p>I remember this specific car lot, because it was adjacent to Elias Brothers’ Big Boy restaurant, a hamburger place that was very easy to find thanks to the thirty-foot tall statue in its parking lot of a big, apple-cheeked, blue-eyed boy with a bizarrely asymmetrical black pompadour. He wore red checkered shorts, suspenders, and a white tee shirt, and held aloft a plate containing three buns separated by hockey pucks meant to evoke hamburgers. “Home of the Original Double Decker” said the sign behind him. Four years earlier, my parents had left Montreal ahead of us to find and furnish our first apartment, and when my aunt, uncle, three cousins, my brother, and I finally arrived in Ann Arbor after about a ten hour drive, this was the first landmark we saw. My car sick brother baptized our new home by violently retching at the Big Boy’s feet, bestowing it with a symbolic value that I grasped even then.</p>
<p>“So what is a light year,” Mary Lou asked shyly one night.</p>
<p>“It’s the distance that light travels in one year,” Jeff promptly answered. “And since light moves incredibly fast – something like 186,000 miles per second – a light year is a really long way away, something like 6 trillion miles.”</p>
<p>“They say UFOs come from places hundreds of light years away,” Mary Lou continued. “How could aliens stay alive for the time it would take to get here?”</p>
<p>John had an answer. “One theory is that their spaceships are complete ecosystems where they can grow their own food and produce their own water and reproduce, for generation after generation.”</p>
<p>“So they live their whole lives in a flying saucer?” Mary Lou asked.</p>
<p>“Sounds great, doesn’t it?” Jeff laughed. “The same people, the same three meals, the same view out the porthole. ‘Look! Stars!’”</p>
<p>“Snooze-o-rama,” Diana offered.</p>
<p>“I dunno,” Mary Lou said off-handedly. “Sounds like my life.”</p>
<p>Though my friends and I looked for UFOs at the end of the 1960s, we were driven more by the casual desire for something new or cool than by real yearning. Life on earth was fascinating enough. We were insatiably interested in ourselves and each other, in music and connection and rebellion, in the big mysteries of existence as well as the smaller, local ones. A serial killer, for example, was raping and murdering brunettes in the area – a two-year period in which my parents were hyper-vigilant about my safety and I blissfully was not. Peter, the red-haired, really nice (and, I realize in retrospect, really gay) classmate seemed to want to go out with me one day, then not the next.</p>
<p>Under cover of darkness, somebody was cutting down Stuckey’s billboards on the stretch of highway between Ann Arbor and Toledo, Ohio.  Stuckeys &#8212; a restaurant chain popular in the South and Midwest, and at that time, in Southeastern Michigan &#8212; was almost as ubiquitous at highway exits as McDonald’s is today. Perky red italics below the logo invited desperate travelers to <em>Relax, Refuel, and Refresh!</em> Behind the gas pumps, adjacent to every Stuckey’s restaurant was a “world famous” Pecan Shoppe. There you could buy not just tins and boxes of nuts, but nougat-and-nut concoctions so petrified and dense that they put ancient redwoods to shame.</p>
<p>“Who are the Billboard Bandits?” asked the <em>Ann Arbor News</em> sometime in 1969, when the numerous Stuckey’s billboards lining the highway began thinning out. Whoever was cutting them down sent no letters to the media; they left no message beyond the act itself. And somehow, over the course of about a year, they never were caught. Some speculated that they were engaged in some form of corporate warfare, others that these were simple vandals. Though there were far more politically or morally egregious targets out there, I felt a frisson of delight each time another Stuckey’s sign hit the asphalt without the axe men being nabbed.</p>
<p>“It’s definitely a statement,” I said to my friend, Arnie. He was a quiet, quirky guy whose deeply subversive outlook was belied by his short hair, bland expression, and standard uniform of button down shirts and khaki pants. Arnie was another regular after-school visitor, bearing spacy, avant garde LPs he thought I should listen to and love.</p>
<p>“What’s the statement saying?” he asked.</p>
<p>“That our patriotic, artificial, sugary culture is coming down.”</p>
<p>“A-plus, Julie,” he said, smiling slightly. “Give that girl a gold star.” Then we fell back into silence and resumed listening to King Crimson.</p>
<p>I never knew what Arnie expected of me in those visits, if he expected anything at all. I couldn’t tell if he just liked me “as a friend” – lacerating words, though fine in Arnie’s case, since that’s how I liked him – or if he was simply too shy to “make the first move” (another term repeatedly used in frustrated or despairing conversations with close friends, as in “When is he going to make the first move?”). Sometimes I just thought he liked the quiet surroundings of my house, or our record player, or my parents’ jazz collection.</p>
<p>But whatever his motives, Arnie was reliable. He’d join our contingent at local anti-war rallies, hand out leaflets supporting our Student Union candidates for the Pioneer High School Student Council, and author well-researched articles about enfranchised minors or progressive education for our high school underground newspaper, <em>The Foundation of Every State</em>.</p>
<p>“No pedagogy which is truly liberating can remain distant from the oppressed by treating them as unfortunates and by presenting for their emulation models from among the oppressors,” he earnestly wrote, quoting Paolo Freire in one of our last issues before graduating.  “The oppressed must be their own example in the struggle for their redemption.”</p>
<p>We’d had a showdown with Mr. Eastman, the Assistant Principal, over that issue. The first page featured a photograph of a bare-bottomed woman at the top of a stairway, bent over and peering between her legs. Her ample derriere filled most of the frame, and I was inordinately proud of the headline that I’d written to accompany the image: “Looking Back on a High School Education.”</p>
<p>“If it goes out, so do you,” the normally, if falsely, jovial Mr. Eastman declared.  My fellow editors and I, all a semester away from college, having variously been suspended for smoking or walking out in protest of the war, or, in the case of my friend Carol and I, for wearing pants to school in defiance of a dress code, were unwilling to face another suspension.</p>
<p>“So much for being our own example in the struggle,” Arnie muttered as we skulked out of Mr. Eastman’s office. That was as close to being visibly angry as I’d ever seen him. But despite his lack of flash, Arnie seethed inside.</p>
<p>I never knew how much until a slate-skied evening at the end of that year, when he invited me to look at something in the immaculate white Plymouth Valiant parked outside my house. The air was damp, and the creak of the hinge was the only sound as he opened his trunk and pointed. Nestled inside were a gas-fueled power saw, an axe, and a sliver of a Stuckey’s billboard.</p>
<p>In a stand-up routine from the 1980s, comedian Joan Rivers wondered why aliens always chose to reveal themselves only to drunken hunters and farmers. Unlike today, rural people didn’t yet signify The Heartland and all that was right and pure with America. The fashion until the Reagan administration was to typecast them as ignorant crackers, a stereotype shockingly apparent in the derisive tone of the 1966 Life magazine article about Frank Mannors, the Dexter man who set off the first in the series of UFO sightings that year.</p>
<p>“Frank should have been born in the days of Dan’l Boone,” it begins. “Since he wasn’t, he’s on the unemployment. Still, he’s a happy man.” The article goes on to itemize the Mannors’ home – an ancient refrigerator with an external cooling coil on top, an outside water pump and privy, and four junked cars on cinderblocks out front. It paints Mannors as a bad-tempered Gomer Pyle, with none of the homespun wisdom.</p>
<p>“That wasn’t no foxfire or hullabillusion,” Mannors insisted two weeks after his UFO sighting. “It was an object. Maybe it’ll come back if all these people would stay away and we could get a picture and have verication of it. Anybody wants to give me a lie-detector test, I’ll take it.”</p>
<p>Nobody wanted to test Mannors veracity. But Sheriff Doug Harvey believed in it. Forty years later, he’d say, “Dr. Hynek was sent in from the U.S. government. He came into my office. We went out to the site where supposedly this object came down on the ground. Dr. Hynek in the car said, &#8216;There is something. We just can&#8217;t put our finger on it. We&#8217;ve been investigating this for quite a while.&#8217; He was on the phone for quite a while, which I found very enlightening. He came out and I said, &#8216;Well, Dr. Hynek. What do you think?&#8217; He said, &#8216;It&#8217;s swamp gas.&#8217; He tells me one minute he has no idea what it is. And then he makes one phone call to Washington and comes out and gives a statement that it&#8217;s swamp gas. Very strange.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They did see something,&#8221; Harvey told an interviewer. &#8220;I&#8217;ll believe this to the day I die. Somebody has kept something quiet, and nothing more ever materialized. So we don&#8217;t know if it was the government experimenting, or was it really a UFO. I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jailer Doug Harvey, overseer of Harvey’s Pigpen, short-hair enforcer, head-busting keeper of the peace, is no longer emboldened by certainty. Forty-six years later, he now believes in government cover-ups. He and The Billboard Bandit turn out to have something in common. Arnie is now one of the country’s foremost authorities on the Freedom of Information act. The Sheriff who was an arm of the State has become a Libertarian, alienated from the authorities he once served; the boy I knew who thrived on subversion has become a man who champions transparency and Americans’ inalienable rights.</p>
<p>And what of Vicky Lou and Vicky Lynn? Did they marry at eighteen, surrender to the powerful pull of the familiar, and disappear into silent woods? I don’t know. But as I have become ever more rooted with age, I like to think that their mothers’ unruly curiosity took seed in them, blowing them to new, alien landscapes.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>1<br />
Once, discovering a crying child in a Pittsburgh department store, I knelt to ask that girl the lost and found questions, her name, her address, and who had mislaid her in Gimbel’s, a store that featured thirteen floors of merchandise.</p>
<p>Back then, toys were above everything but furniture, but we were on the first floor with perfume, cosmetics, jewelry, and well-dressed saleswomen who offered samples.  Security, like her grandmother, was somewhere else, and when she clutched my hand, the nearby escalator so strongly suggested how easily something awful could happen that I half-expected an abduction alarm.</p>
<p>The tiny wisps of sprayed scents made the air seem funereal, the shoppers mostly old women who had driven to Pittsburgh since World War II, so few of them by then the store was rumored to be going bankrupt.  But suddenly, in Gimbel’s, no one hailing that girl or me, not even when we approached the gilded, outside doors, I watched our reflection coming toward us and briefly recognized the dreadful alternatives to a common scene.</p>
<p>2<br />
I warned my daughter, when she was seven, about not paying attention to where I was in a one-story department store that was spread out as an anchor store at the end of a Harrisburg area mall.  Three times in fifteen minutes.  And then, when she ran off to look at toys in an adjoining aisle without me, instead of cautioning her for a fourth time, I slipped behind a pillar and watched her from hiding.  It took nearly a minute before she looked around and saw that I was gone.  I watched her nearly spin as she searched.  For a few seconds, her face appeared to be blank, and I waited until she looked terrified before I stepped out when her back was turned and walked up to her as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>3<br />
Recently, a woman from Pittsburgh has revealed she is unable to recognize faces.  Her daughter’s teacher.  A friend from church.  The wait staff person who has just visited her restaurant table.  Her daughter, seven years old, prompts the names of neighbors, reminds her which of her friends have arrived for sleepovers. Like a bride receiving guests, she’s taught herself to smile. A wonder we recognize anyone, she says, so much we have in common.  According to the article in the newspaper about her, the condition she has is called prosopagnosia.</p>
<p>4<br />
Thirty-five years ago I bowled on Friday afternoons with public school  teachers like myself who needed to drink and drive a sixteen pound ball into the pocket to feel better about another week of large group discipline situations—cafeteria duty, study hall, or a room full of in-school suspensions. My students ranged in age from fifteen to eighteen, college, work, or trouble bound, some of the girls so beautiful I trained myself to look over their heads to where I needed to concentrate on the sluggish and bored.</p>
<p>In early March, two of those bowlers were put on paid leave for alleged misconduct. Sixth and third grade, they taught, those men married like I was, with daughters, but by the end of the school year the one who photographed his eight-year-old students found a new job teaching fourth grade in a school district an hour away because the principal commended his teaching in a letter for his file, passing him on like rumors because he hadn’t touched those girls or asked them to undress, the photos explained as a sentimental hobby.</p>
<p>5<br />
In the news, a few months ago, the story of a nine-year-old girl’s unusual death.  Because she needed to be taught a lesson, she’d been forced to keep running for three hours.  For stealing candy. For being selfish.  Her grandmother prodded her and screamed, making sure she didn’t stop jogging in place, and apparently, she didn’t until she collapsed into seizures and died like some unprepared marathon runner “hitting the wall.”</p>
<p>The girl who died was on life support for a few days.  She was so dehydrated her sodium level fell below what sustains life.  The grandmother, the reports say, worked her over like a drill sergeant while her stepmother, within earshot and sight line, took care of her own three-year-old.</p>
<p>6<br />
One night, when she was nine, our daughter screamed.  When my wife and I opened her door, she was standing on her bed, her pajamas pressed against her body.  A man’s face had been at the window, she said.  He wore a Phillies hat and he looked like a Halloween pumpkin.  My wife calmed her down while I went outside to where I found a paint-splattered cinderblock that man had left behind, inviting us to check the garages of our neighbors to identify similar splatters on things stored in one of them.  Or maybe, I thought, a supply of cinderblocks kept by a man who lugged them around the neighborhood as ladders while looking for windows where the drapes were open.</p>
<p>Years later, my wife told me the man who bought that house from us when we sold it had confessed to raping “his girls” in that bedroom where our daughter slept from ages six to ten.</p>
<p>7<br />
Empathy is often said to be the ability to imagine yourself in someone else’s place, understanding hisorher feelings and desires, to, in the end, experience an appropriate emotional response.      Just as often, I’ve noticed, the definition declares that empathy is the cornerstone of morality.</p>
<p>8<br />
After we moved, the distance to our new home less than a mile, my wife and I would occasionally walk back to that house where the never-captured Peeping Tom had spent at least one night at the window.  In less than a year the new owners took out the hedges along the edge of the property and replaced them with a fence.  They dug out the shrubbery that nearly surrounded the front porch and left it bare.  The yard filled with a litter of toys.  “It looks terrible,” my wife said, and I agreed.  It was hardly recognizable, as if we’d never lived there.</p>
<p>9<br />
After a short while, that child I found in Gimbel’s stopped whimpering.  She clutched my hand.  We finished half a circuit around the first floor before I saw where a set of offices were located.  An employee in one of them said he would be happy to broadcast the name of the child’s grandmother.</p>
<p>10<br />
A man I knew when I was a high school teacher in upstate New York told me how, at Niagara Falls, a woman he’d never seen before bent down to say to his young daughter, “What a darling you are,” then followed those words quickly with “Want to see?” while she lifted her and swung her high.  He thought, at that moment, the woman was the one person who would throw a child over the railing, and then, he was just as certain she was one of a few who would steal a child, who would flee into the crowd where she had accomplices who would pass his daughter like a relay baton while she disappeared among thousands of families because she carried a coat to wear over her distinctive purple sweater.  He rushed at that woman, tore his daughter from her arms, and she cursed him as if he was a soldier assigning her child to a boxcar.</p>
<p>At the time, I thought this man was someone who exaggerated, someone who embellished stories to make an impression.  “What did the woman look like?” I said, and the man shrugged.</p>
<p>“I have no idea,” he said.  “All I remember is that purple sweater.”</p>
<p>11.<br />
Shortly after we moved to our new house, my wife and I walked the nearby highway where a man, we’d read in the newspaper, had thrown his daughter in front of a truck.  We watched headlights approach from both directions.  We gauged the speeds from the limit of forty-five to excesses of sixty or more.  To get to a convenience store, we crossed the highway during breaks in the traffic.  After we left the store, while we were waiting to cross again, I placed my hands on her back and said, “Imagine.”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with you?” she said as lights came from both sides like testimony.</p>
<p>12<br />
<em>Prosopagnosia</em> is a word I’ve never encountered before, yet when I investigate it online, I discover dozens of sites—questions from those who believe they’re living with this condition, blogs from the self-proclaimed, jargon-filled medical tracts.  On one of those sites I log on to a test to determine whether I recognize fear, anger, and joy in faces, whether those emotions reveal themselves to me in the faces of samples.  Which doesn’t seem to be a test for prosopagnosia, because anyone who fails to distinguish the emotions exhibited by the expressions presented wouldn’t really see the humanity in a face at all.</p>
<p>13<br />
Because I write biweekly columns, my wife and I study the opinion page of our local paper, especially looking for letters to the editor that react to what I write.  She was the first to see the letter from the man who had raped three girls from three different families, apologizing from prison, acknowledging that his cellmate had written the letter for him as he dictated.</p>
<p>He used the word “molested” as if he was whispering in church.  Both my wife and I, because all of those girls were younger than nine, vowed never to forgive, ready to remember like families who inherit vengeance.</p>
<p>An elementary school sits almost directly across the street from our house, reminding us five days a week about the size and shape of second and third and fourth grade, what we believed he still wanted as he dictated, “I hope and pray for them to heal.”  As if God would intervene, sending heaven’s Red Cross to the country of damage.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, at the school playground, I watched other peoples’ girls while shame surrounded my eyes like gnats.  I’d told my wife I hoped the inmate secretary would think to shorten penitence with a belt around the throat.  She said she was trying to imagine the penmanship, the lines and loops.  “It had to be clumsy,” she said.  “It was probably printed.”</p>
<p>And I kept to myself how I was sure the letter had been written on paper torn from the kind of tablet I carried home from grade school, passing pairs of girls who always dawdled, busy talking until one of them turned up a driveway and the other cut across a wooded lot to save herself three blocks of walking home alone.</p>
<p>14<br />
The stepmother of the girl who was run to death was nine months pregnant when the girl died.  She gave birth shortly after, conjuring in me the word <em>replaceable</em>.  A videotape from the dead girl’s school bus had recorded the grandmother  declaring to the driver, “I gonna run her till she can’t run no more” just before she initiated the punishment she thought was appropriate.</p>
<p>15<br />
Our daughter has two daughters of her own now.  They live in California, and  one night our daughter called to tell us one of her paintings had been rented by the producers of the television series <em>Californication</em>. She sounded excited, but we didn’t subscribe to the channel that was showing the series.  The painting, my daughter explained, is in David Duchovny’s bedroom, just watch when you get the chance.</p>
<p>Months later, we rented the series from NetFlix.  The painting didn’t appear in episodes one or two, but there were occasional glimpses of nude woman rising from Duchovny’s designer sheets.  And though our daughter had told us the painting was in episode three, I still followed those bodies past a wall of unfamiliar art.  Soon, because he fucked a succession of women in that bed, his teenage daughter often nearby, she, too, saw those women naked, entering like a maid, all of them in that bedroom with my daughter’s painting in Los Angeles where my daughter lives with her daughters, eight and five, who ran naked, last summer, under the sprinkler in our Pennsylvania yard.</p>
<p>I fast-forwarded through each external shot, hurrying toward my daughter’s painting in David Duchovny’s bedroom, the naked woman in episode three a creative writing student like those I teach, nineteen or twenty, sliding one step to the side so I could see the chairs suspended in the tumultuous blue sky of my daughter’s rented painting on either side of that girl’s bare shoulders. She talked and talked until, at last, she turned into profile, her breast the focal point of that artless scene, the painting completely exposed, half of the dark chairs silhouetted by the faint light my daughter allowed behind that storm of identical chairs in David Duchovny’s bedroom.</p>
<p>16<br />
My wife and I eventually learned from the newspaper that the man who bought our house raped each daughter at an earlier age than the one before.  In order to have  privacy, that bedroom where our daughter slept, where, I’m sure, those girls must have slept as well, had two doors that had to be locked.  Surely, over a period of years, the mother would try one of those doors when she noticed her husband and one of the girls had vanished.  She might even have taken to her tiptoes at that window used by the pumpkin-headed man.</p>
<p>“What kept those three girls from screaming?” my wife said.  “How could they stay living in that house after he abused them?  How could they stand to see him every day?”</p>
<p>“They probably learned to look right past him,” I said.  “You know, the middle distance or something like that.”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe that,” she said.  “And why didn’t we recognize who he was when we sold our house to him?”</p>
<p>“”I didn’t look,” I said.</p>
<p>My wife frowned.  “That’s just like you,” she said.  “Never noticing anything important.  I bet you couldn’t identify him if he walked into our house.”</p>
<p>17<br />
When I look up articles on empathy, I find a consensus that reads something like this: Empathy is important in the development of a moral sense, a person&#8217;s beliefs about the appropriateness or goodness of what he does, thinks, or feels.</p>
<p>18<br />
The sixth grade teacher who bowled with me was eventually fired. During that spring, that man’s daughter listened five days a week to my lessons on grammar, writing, and literature for the New York Regents Exam she’d pass in June, all semester babysitting for my three children, ages three to eight.  Her father would be watching television when I walked her to the door after midnight, concentrating, most Saturdays, on Chiller Theater even when she said, “Hello.”  Two or three times I glanced at the aliens or zombies before I turned and left, not saying a word about the woman hired as his substitute or how no one took his place at bowling, his average minus ten used to compute his team’s score each Friday, that number steady as a pulse propelled by machine until the league season ended.<br />
During the summer that man quietly moved without announcing where.  The third-grade teacher took his photographs to a school near Rochester.  It was a time when Polaroids appeared slowly, so he would have had to watch light and shadow developing into a girl’s body as he counted the necessary seconds, saying, “Yes, good, perfect, and thank you” when the image, at last, showed itself complete.</p>
<p>19<br />
In that mall, among all those toys, there was such joy in my daughter’s face as she saw me, I could barely stand myself, sick with recognizing an evil selfishness in myself.</p>
<p>20<br />
When we visited in December, our granddaughters slept over with us in the apartment we rented.  One morning I convinced them to write and illustrate books of their own.<br />
The cookie in my five year-old granddaughter’s self-illustrated book had long hair cut into bangs so much like hers I said, “The gingerbread man is a girl,” but she explained he was wearing a wig. Like it always does in these stories, her cookie escaped the kitchen to run and play, but on the last page that gingerbread man was trapped inside the mouth of a scarlet fox, the wig gone in the final picture, lost, perhaps, in the struggle.</p>
<p>When I asked why he was smiling as he was being swallowed, she said, “Because he only has one face.”</p>
<p>Her older sister drew twelve pages about a princess who needed to be saved.</p>
<p>She was locked in a red-brick tower for a dozen sunny days, her hair tightly curled and long, but nowhere near what would welcome a prince to climb.  One line per page, her princess sang an abridged “Over the Rainbow.”  Bluebirds dotted every clear sky.  Lemon drops sparkled, then faded, but as the book ended, the prince, arriving on horseback, applauded but didn’t dismount.</p>
<p>“What’s next?”I asked.</p>
<p>“The rest of the story,” she whispered, “is a secret-secret.”</p>
<p>Later that day, my daughter, thirty-seven now, volunteered that giving birth introduces the worst fear we can possibly know.  As an illustration, she told me a story of her own.</p>
<p>“Remember when I rode around for a few months, the year I was sixteen, in David Dixon’s fast, expensive car?”</p>
<p>“Vaguely,” I said, not telling her that I couldn’t even remember who David Dixon was.</p>
<p>“Then you remember that he killed his next girl friend,” she said.  “And he was just driving her a couple of miles to the movies.”</p>
<p>I knew she meant me to understand this was about her daughters, five and eight, the probabilities of danger they’re facing as they grow up, but then she leaned toward me as if those girls were eavesdropping.  “I found out David Dixon’s dead, too.  On the Internet when I looked him up.  He died in another country, one of those places you’ve never heard of where nobody travels.”</p>
<p>As if he had been a criminal, I thought.  As if he had been disposed.</p>
<p>21<br />
The last day of our visit I gave each girl a piece of thin red cellophane cut into the shape of a fish.  “A miracle fish,” I told them.  “It tells your fortune if you hold it in your hand for a minute.”</p>
<p>They watched the miracle fish swim on their palms until the cellophane curled into fickle, false, and finally, lying still, trustworthy.  Despite the novelty, their futures looked to be as unsurprising as the stories on their collection of Disney DVDs.</p>
<p>In the morning, I hugged those girls goodbye and flew two thousand miles into winter.</p>
<p>22<br />
A man, once, sent me messages that detailed his desire to be the serial killer of girls so young their bodies were hairless. He said he lived in Virginia, not far, and he wanted to leave his wife for girls like the littles whose photos he began to send when, because I needed them to write an essay about child pornography,  I didn’t shut his comments off.<br />
Attention-getting, those pictures, like previews or headlines, each girl posed to bring a prison sentence. I remember their photographs each time the evening news carries a story like the one he wrote, driving me outside to dilute that memory with walking fast like I did, this week, when I heard about one more man arrested for storing child photos, unwittingly sharing with somebody whose job it is to pose each day as a preteen.</p>
<p>During my last such walk I wished that my cyber child-killer had turned out to be a policeman baiting like-minded men to reciprocal sharing of photographs.  I followed the approaching stratus clouds into the orange and scarlet of a late winter sunset, how they split the deep tangerine from the blue-going-violet during twilight‘s beautiful cruelty.  Each hidden rustling sounded like words of dark, prophetic purposes, and I remembered that not one word that chat room pervert had sent me mentioned a characteristic of a child’s face.</p>
<p>23<br />
When my children were young, the milk carton that often sat on the table during meals always featured the face of a missing child.  “Have You Seen Me?” its caption read, and those faces reminded me to be thankful even as my children yammered their petty complaints.</p>
<p>Eventually, milk cartons stopped showing lost children, but now those missing children’s faces show up inside my income tax instructional booklet.  I turn the pages, looking at each child, and all of them seem hopelessly lost.  How are they chosen from among the thousands who are painfully eligible?</p>
<p>There are computer projections now of how those children, some of them lost for five or even ten years, would look in the present.  My eyes shift from the photographs to the computer images and back again, searching for how facial features have been transformed.  After a few minutes I try not to imagine what most missing children end up looking like.</p>
<p>24<br />
Some things need to be impossible.</p>
<p>No one recognizing a child so vulnerable to abduction from a failing department store.<br />
A child run for three hours while no one recognizes her condition is nearing death.<br />
A mother, her daughter there to coach her, searching, without recognition, the mug book of the everyday for the identity, not only of acquaintances, but also of those she loves.<br />
No one recognizing that three sisters were being repeatedly raped by their father in my daughter’s former bedroom.  And how selfish I am to think a location I’m familiar with makes it worse.</p>
<p>Each blessing is lace. In Gimbel’s, at last, a woman recognized her granddaughter’s trusting face.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>the desire for rain was so strong folks killed snakes, hung them belly-up from fences. In between the blankets of dust and half-buried children, the miles of crisp carcasses stretched over barbed-wire, men dropped to their knees, many for the first time, and asked God to snare the rain—for the winds and madness to cease. But the topsoil failed to relent and muscled underneath clapboards, the warped window edges—clogging eyes, mouths—and turned the world into the darkest hole one had ever leaned in. And over in Texas, rainmakers shot nitroglycerine jelly into the red cloud cover, the TNT devices housed in rubber balloons, in an attempt to birth another ocean, to turn the world upside down. But the balloons failed and the sky didn’t cave and only bits of rubber fell.</p>
<p>Cimarron County, Oklahoma<br />
When the big storm arrived April 14th, 1935—Black Sunday—the woman who believed the end was near drowned her twin daughters in a bucket of lye water. Livestock—the cattle and horses and goats and sheep—in grassless pastures befell to blindness from sand and ran in circles, choked and died. Others lumbered straight into the sides of barns, of houses, and broke their necks. Families, in one last attempt to flee, packed cans of beans and chicken feet into their Model A or covered wagon. Some even tied quartered animals and their dead relatives to the tops. When a wheeled buggy got hung on a rim of road silt and sank, the people waited inside during daylight hours as the “black blizzards” rolled over, counted Mississippis while sand rose to the windows and grit stripped the paint, then crawled out at night when the world spun slower, when the winds petered out, to cook sugar-cured bacon, once hand stuffed in cans, atop a tumbleweed fire.</p>
<p>Dallam County, Texas<br />
Soil swallowed the sun like a horse pill, and for weeks it failed to show its restless head. Often, when a brother or father or sister or mother slipped into the so-called apocalypse, he or she usually suffocated to death within the first surveyor’s chain—a land measurement of sixty-six feet at pinnacle—and may or may not have been found when the winds abated. The bulging bellies of the dead were full of sand, of stones the size of buffalo nickels. And inches into this darkness, static electricity crackled in blue flame, knocked the men who got too close to the ground, and forced women to tie cloth around door handles to spare the children from piddling.</p>
<p>Seward County, Kansas<br />
One morning when the sky opened after weeks environmental paralysis residents found a gift: thousands of rabbits. The community, with torn overalls and soot-covered faces, formed rabbit drives, and equipped all men, women, and children with a club—hammer, stick, rock—and forced the hares against fences, into the corners of dwellings, where women and children waited in shadow with clenched fists, with bony arms held high, for a turn. After hundreds of rabbits were knocked dead and piled like stones, the drivers, the killers, with bloody knuckles and cheeks, tacked the beasts to chunks of wood, yanked their hides off. The communities had a barbecue, along parched roads, the first meal other than sand or lard biscuits in months. And like the rabbits, grasshoppers arrived in swarms, swallowed fields of dwindling crops. The children, weather permitting, would play hopper-stomp with bug juices between their toes and squash the brittle husks underfoot long into the night. But after all the wheat was gone, and rabbit, and bean cans, people made grasshopper soups, relishes, biscuits, anything to avoid having their bellies wrap around their backbones.</p>
<p>Kiowa County, Colorado<br />
Silicosis, the lung disease also known as potter’s rot, closed one’s life like a scab. To manufacture dust masks, women cut bed sheets and wet them in bowls of wash water, of urine, and wrapped the frayed filters around the heads of their children, of their greedy husbands. Before the rags dried, brown rings formed around mouth edges where soil slipped through, and while the dirt ate at the plains, at the people and animals, at the moisture in eyes and lungs, families moved in all directions with these grit catchers strung around their heads, looking for a tractor or a dead body to crawl under, any place to hide.</p>
<p>On the North Bank of the Potomac<br />
Most Americans, outside of those still living in the plains, had no idea 300 million tons of soil from Oklahoma moved east on a given day, clogging highways, the view of the sun. When it finally reached D.C., the South Lawn of the White House, Franklin D. Roosevelt rested in his wheelchair near the water fountain as the first cloud descended, when pebbles and prairie grasses blew into his gin martini, his eyes. And maybe it irritated him when he couldn’t see the White House through all the silt, the madness, the tumbleweeds that skimmed the Mississippi River and rolled straight to Maryland and were now caught in the spokes of his chair. And, perhaps, after he realized the dirt was too thick to pick from his drink, he wheeled himself, or, rather, a servant wheeled him, into the house where he called on Congress to act before the millions of refugees arrived at his doorstep, with hats turned up, with dead and dying children in their arms, with a bone to break.</p>
<p>Down on Capitol Hill<br />
In an emergency meeting, Congress proposed drilling the Ogallala aquifer to hell if need be. No man-made disaster shall fill the eyes of a U.S. President, they said. And pudgy men, in shiny Fords, rolled onto the prairie in straight lines with seersucker suits, hair slicked in pomade jelly, and stood, rubbed elbows at the bottom of the world. And these men, some six deep in cars and sipping highballs, drove to swallowed farms to access the damage, to discuss government programs that could fix the catastrophe, but nothing worked and the dust blew.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a murderous time/ the heart breaks and breaks/ and lives by breaking.<br />
—Stanley Kunitz (from “The Testing Tree”)</p>
<p>…We were still men,/ but maimed.  Another kind of hurt lodged/ where happiness had smoldered, another kind/ of ruin, and summer came.<br />
—Marie Howe (from “The Wise Men”)</p>
<p>Marie Howe’s three books <em>The Good Thief</em> (1988), <em>What the Living Do</em> (1998), and <em>The Kingdom of Ordinary Time</em> (2008) provide a convincing argument for the durability and timeliness of lyric narrative poetry.  Her poetry meditatively witnesses the self as it unfolds in time, but amounts to more than mere spiritual autobiography. Howe’s poetry transubstantiates strands of confessional detail, personal biography, and the detritus of everyday existence into a greater narrative of what it feels like to be alive.   Marie Howe’s poetry charts the same territory as the poetry of her mentor, Stanley Kunitz. In a 1968 interview with David Lupher, Stanley Kunitz remarked, “All poetry is born of love, and the moment one doesn’t have love enough for the world, or love enough for others—at that point one is dead as a poet.”  But love for Howe, as for Kunitz, remains circumscribed by the danger that comes from living in a murderous time.  As Howe elaborated in a 1997 interview in <em>BOMB</em> magazine:</p>
<p>It takes so much courage to love, doesn&#8217;t it? Maybe it&#8217;s always been difficult, but in this age and in this culture &#8211; capitalism doesn&#8217;t want love, it wants us to buy and eat a culture that spends its money on defense systems &#8211; where so many of our communities are lonely and false, shattered and dangerous, and children&#8217;s hearts are broken very early. Remember when the Surgeon General said the most pressing medical problem in American culture was addiction? Is addiction thwarted love giving up the hope of human connection? The fierce, real, clear energy of actual love, intentional defenselessness, the &#8220;unromantic daily love&#8221; of changing a grown man&#8217;s diapers, or moving someone&#8217;s car on street cleaning day so she can sleep &#8211; this daily love keeps many of us alive. To act in this world, without irony or condescension, as the younger sister does, seems to me an act of great courage. The long journey from the head to the heart.</p>
<p>Marie Howe’s three books betray an allegiance to this notion of “unromantic daily love” even as they act in this world without irony or condescension.  This fidelity to the unvarnished, simple, acts of love, devotion, and kindness separates Marie Howe’s work from the work of most of her contemporaries. Ultimately, Howe’s poetry abides as a poetry of action because it moves us through the recognizable kingdom of ordinary time, through various biblical and literary mythologies, to an apprehension of what we, the living, do.</p>
<p>In looking at Howe’s three books, the first impulse is to chart her growth and change as a poet, moving from the Biblical and fairytale persona poems of <em>The Good Thief</em>, through the personal poems of her second collection, into the masterfully balanced poems of her third collection.  However, Howe’s work in these collections has no beginning, middle, or end; there is no neat spiritual arc to trace.  Although each collection is self-contained, all of the poems are in dialogue with each other in a way that is particular to her work and, perhaps, unprecedented among collections of poetry.   Of course, there are shifts in personal perception as Howe describes in explaining the impact of her brother’s death on her view of the world:</p>
<p>After John died, the world became very clear &#8211; as if a window had broken &#8211; the world     itself became very dear. It was the place John had lived, and as long as I still walked     around I could catch glimpses of him. But more than that, when John died I felt as if I     had finally entered the larger community of humans. Now I knew unbearable grief, and     I was like other people in this world who had known this. I began to understand that     everything I knew and loved would pass away, and I would pass away. I would die like     my brother had died, and the world, the actual &#8220;is-ness&#8221; of it became and remains very     precious to me &#8211; the wind, running water, voices.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the perspective of looking through a broken window on a clear, and dear, and dangerous, but lovely, landscape ran throughout <em>The Good Thief</em>; in “From Nowhere,” for example, the speaker says:</p>
<p>But this morning, a kind day has descended, from nowhere,</p>
<p>and making coffee in the usual way, measuring grounds<br />
with the wooden spoon, I remembered,</p>
<p>this is how things happen, cup by cup, familiar gesture<br />
after gesture, what else can we know of safety</p>
<p>or of fruitfulness?</p>
<p>In these lines, the dearness of the most ordinary and mindless of everyday activities is neither diluted, nor obscured.  These lines would be just as at home in Howe’s later collections because they are animated by a reverence for the small details of life that when carefully attended to constitute the “unromantic daily love” synonymous with faith.</p>
<p>Søren Kierkegaard maintained that faith is a process of infinite becoming.   Howe’s faith is a faith divested of dogma, wherein love becomes the still center.  The spirituality ghosting through her poems is a reverence for the commonplace.   Howe’s reverence for the imperfect allows her to map the long journey from the head to the heart.  This is a journey that is private and public, solitary and communal; it includes an ongoing conversation with the stuttering Moses, with the passionate Mary Magdalene, with her dead brother, with her living family, with the poets, such as Kunitz, who preceded her, and with the readers who admire her work. The crusty dishes are still piling up for the plumber who has not been called and in the domain of the routine, Howe’s poems nudge the humdrum, without irony or condescension, toward a sisterly embrace of all that is holy, right here.  Howe uncovers the way the sacred inhabits the habitual and in this uncovering there is a breaking, like Kunitz’s heart that breaks and breaks and lives by breaking. The idea of living by breaking forms the core of Howe’s poetry. Howe’s representations of daily life, her appropriation and reinterpretation of Christian myths, and her poetry’s depictions of femininity provide a means for examining the complicated ways her poetry breaks a window on the world and holds forth the precious “is-ness” of trees, running water, and voices, despite, and because of, our mortality.</p>
<p>Howe’s poetry lives in the liminal space between the mundane tasks that make up our days and the knowledge that the routines that bind us to life are also bound to death.  In an interview with Terry Gross on National Public Radio’s <em>Fresh Air</em>, Howe articulated one of her poetry’s central concerns this way:</p>
<p>Poetry holds the knowledge that we are alive and that we know we&#8217;re going to die. The     most mysterious aspect of being alive might be that, and poetry knows that.</p>
<p>So everybody we know is going to die and many of us will attend our beloved friends and family. So what each friend who has died has told me is, it&#8217;s going to happen to you too. You know, here I go, bye, you know? And every time that happens, it&#8217;s a new experience that I feel like I&#8217;ve been privileged to be near or close to the door when they&#8217;ve gone.</p>
<p>All three of Marie Howe’s books occupy this space “near or close to the door” from which the loved one leaves.  Her poems bear witness to the great mystery that is at the center of our lives.  As Mary says of this mystery in a poem from <em>The Kingdom of Ordinary Time</em>: “…I saw it./ It was a thing and spirit both: the real/ world: evident, invisible.”  In this poem, the mystic vision “bled out, breathed up and mingled” with the invisible world evident in “bush and cow and dust and well.” The painfully ordinary things of this world are the real substance of the spiritual world.  The world beyond the world is everywhere present and here, if only apprehended in sight’s periphery; of course, all great poetry allows its readers a slant glance, an insight into envisioning’s blurred edges. Howe’s poetry, then, is spiritual in the way that Whitman’s poetry is spiritual; Whitman’s spirituality, grandly communal as Howe’s is, begins, as Lewis Hyde points out, in the knowledge: “I know that my body shall decay.”  From this knowledge comes an invocation of the broad blessing of all that surrounds us so complexly and confusedly, but so gracefully: family, friends, chores, work, the joy that can be derived from organizing a recycling bin or taking your dog for a walk on a windy day in autumn.</p>
<p>Tony Hoagland has noted that Marie Howe can be regarded as a contemporary American spiritual poet because of her familiarity with states of grace and the priority with which she invests the pursuit of those states.  Hoagland notes the precarious position that a poet who engages any type of spirituality through her poetry puts herself in, but argues passionately for reading Howe critically as a spiritual poet. Hoagland says:</p>
<p>In a time when &#8220;directness&#8221; is unfashionable, they take the risk of addressing matters of     faith. In their respective ways, their attention is resolutely intent on making contact with Being. Moreover, their American individualities are influenced by religious traditions of striking distinctness.</p>
<p>Hoagland’s essay notes that Howe’s poetic deeply internalizes Catholic Christian myth; the essay convincingly begins to elaborate Howe’s conversion of Catholic symbol and myth into the idiomatic understructure of her second and third books.  However, Hoagland’s study of Howe’s work dwells primarily on the patriarchal underpinnings of the tradition, exploring the archetypes of the sacrificial son/bother, explaining the image of Christ in the poem “The Snow Storm,” and examining patterns of epiphany brought on by exile or loss, which more often than not imply Moses, or God the Father.  These elements are indeed important to understanding Marie Howe as a poet, but it is her examination of what it is to be a girl, a daughter, a sister, a lover, a wife, a mother, and a woman in America for the past sixty two years that links her three collections most closely together and that allows for her unique contemplation of the metaphysical in a way that transcends gender, politics, ideology, or creed.</p>
<p>In Marie Howe’s three books of poetry, female figures exit, follow, enter, and speak, or almost speak, to the divine, even as the important details of the everyday divert their attention; on the cusp of communion, on the verge of an urgent talk with an absent God, they are called away by “…the drugstore, the beauty products, the luggage” they need to buy for a trip.  In these female figures, who know the wisdom of the mystics and yet who flee this wisdom, caught in the detritus and drift of a consumer culture, Howe reimagines the Christian archetypes of  femininity and reinterprets them in a way that allows her readers to ask existential questions as old as Eve’s dilemma.  In <em>The Kingdom of Ordinary Time</em>, a book dedicated to her daughter, Grace Yi-Nan Howe, and to her late mother, Jane Crowley Howe, the section “Poems from the Life of Mary” provide a fulcrum for the collection and are closely in dialogue with the poems that explore notions of femininity in her earlier collections.  Unlike, but in conversation with, Rainer Maria Rilke’s “Life of Mary” poems, Howe’s poems focus on the mother of God before the Immaculate Conception.  Howe’s poem ends with the Annunciation, the third poem in Rilke’s cycle.  In Howe’s poem the Annunciation is described as “a tilting within myself.”  Howe’s Mary continues:</p>
<p>as one turns a mirror to flash the light to where<br />
it isn’t—I was blinded like that—and swam<br />
in what shone at me</p>
<p>only able to endure it by being no one and so<br />
specifically myself I thought I’d die<br />
from being loved like that.</p>
<p>Mary is rearticulated as much more than theotokos, Christ-Bearer; she is not merely a vessel for the divine. She is no one and she is “so specifically” herself. Mary’s ability to receive love and to be a mother to the divine does not erase her specificity as a woman, as a person who endures life, who endures being in such uncertainties. Howe’s Mary would be no less at home in the Star Market, among the feeble shuffling through the aisles and the lame smelling of decay, than she would be under the light of the Bethlehem star, among those slouching wise men and singing angels.</p>
<p>Everywhere in Howe’s work, the poet presents women and girls buffeted by the boring, struggling with the extraordinary, trying to speak to the sacred, but given no easy recourse to epiphany.  Howe herself was the oldest sister in a family of nine children. She became a mother at the age of fifty-two when she adopted her daughter. As she told Terry Gross:</p>
<p>My mother gave birth to nine of us and she had two miscarriages, so she was pregnant     11 times. And as we&#8217;ve said earlier, many of us daughters have trouble separating from     our mothers, especially if our mother is merged with us in the oldest girl of a big family…</p>
<p>In Howe’s work, the roles of mother and daughter often overlap and elide; biblical women are re-envisioned, or reinterpreted, as vocal, active, thoughtful, and fraught with contradictions. Two poems from <em>What the Living Do</em> provide examples.  In “Memorial,” a poem about the death of a friend, Howe rewrites Martha, the woman from the Gospel of Luke, whom Jesus chastised for complaining that she had to do all the work while her sister, Mary, sat talking with him.  Howe writes:</p>
<p>Jesus said, Mary chose the better part, to Martha, who was complaining about<br />
her sister not helping. She never helped.</p>
<p>But I love that woman slamming around the kitchen. She’s made food enough<br />
For more than a dozen people, and no one’s even the least bit hungry—</p>
<p>She’s scraping the plates into a stack to carry to the table and now she sets them<br />
down heavily with a huff. Jesus is speaking in a quiet voice.</p>
<p>He’s a kind man, Martha is thinking; he doesn’t mean any harm, but if I don’t do it,<br />
it won’t get done.</p>
<p>Howe humanizes Martha in the retelling at a moment in the poem when the speaker is expressing frustration over not being in charge of her friend’s cremated remains.  Howe’s kinship with Martha is a kinship we all share, caught as we are, even in the face of death, with the struggle to scrape the plates, or hold the urn, to make some noise from the distant kitchen and be heard, even as everything seems to be slipping through our fingers like ash. Martha behaves as both weary wise caretaker and attention seeking brat; she fulfills the role of beleaguered mother and complaining daughter.  More importantly, the internal struggle she enacts is the story of a soul in search of spiritual fulfillment, railing against itself and others as it dutifully labors to perform its daily tasks.</p>
<p>Similarly, the poem “The Girl” elaborates on this spiritual struggle.  Howe’s short poem reads:</p>
<p>So close to the end of my childbearing life<br />
without children</p>
<p>—if I could remember a day when I was utterly a girl<br />
and not yet a woman—</p>
<p>but I don’t think there was a day like that for me.</p>
<p>When I look at the girl I was, dripping in her bathing suit,<br />
or riding her bike, pumping hard down the newly paved street,</p>
<p>she wears a furtive look—<br />
and even if I could go back in time to her as me, the age I am now</p>
<p>she would never come into my arms<br />
without believing that I wanted something.</p>
<p>The permanent sense of dis-ease is painful in this poem. Certainly this poem is in dialogue with the poem, “The Boy,” which begins this collection.  “The Boy” ends with the lines: “I was the girl. What happened taught me to follow him, whoever he was,/ calling and calling his name.” Notably, however, in “The Girl” the female figure is not following a brother, or a father, or a lover.  Here, the girl is solitary, and although “she wears a furtive look,” she retains the agency of disbelief.  For Howe, spiritual witness involves looking at the irreconcilable fragments of the self, weaving together all the contradictorily coarse and fine threads of biography, listening to the cacophony of all the Marthas banging pots in the kitchen while the Lord waits in the living room.</p>
<p>This sense of being in a world of uncertainties and contradiction, always on the verge of some great mystery, constantly courted by grief and loss, that informs <em>What the Living Do</em> and <em>The Kingdom of Ordinary Time</em>, also deeply informed Howe’s first book, <em>The Good Thief</em>.  The first poem of <em>The Good Thief</em> inaugurates the discussion of what it means to be a woman, or a spiritual being, today. In “Part of Eve’s Discussion,” the speaker opens up a dialogue with Mary, Martha, Mary Magdalene, and all the mothers, daughters, girls, wives, lovers, and women who populate Howe’s body of work. Howe’s prose poem begins the conversation:</p>
<p>It was like the moment when a bird decides not to eat from your hand,<br />
and flies, just before it flies, the moment the rivers seem to still<br />
and stop because a storm is coming, but there is no storm, as when<br />
a hundred starlings lift and bank together before they wheel and drop,<br />
very much like the moment, driving on bad ice, when it occurs to you<br />
your car could spin, just before it slowly begins to spin, like<br />
the moment just before you forgot what it was you were about to say,<br />
it was like that, and after that, it was still like that, only<br />
all the time.</p>
<p>The biblical fall is reenergized by modern details; all of existence becomes the moment before the car begins to spin on bad ice.  Before and during overlap, the bird decides not to eat from your hand and flies, but it doesn’t; everything falls to stillness, what is.  By rendering the fall contemporaneous, Howe suggests that falling IS like having faith, is something that’s constantly occurring; if both doubt and faith are processes of infinite becoming, then maybe all we have are the stories like the one she tells to her daughter in “The Spell:” “…I dropped you off, I taught my class/ I ate a tuna fish sandwich, wrote emails, returned phone calls, talked with students/ and then I came to pick you up.”   Those stories are acts of kindness, and as her daughter knows, there are stories behind stories, subtexts that only become clear through other acts of love.</p>
<p>Eve’s discussion is a discussion of how to live in a world where the old hierarchies of family and religion have flattened out.  In an uncollected poem, published in the <em>American Poetry Review</em>, Howe’s concerns as a spiritual poet are summarized in a deep re-imagining of Mary Magdalene, a figure who, in this poem gathers the varied strains of complaint and praise levied by the female figures in all of Howe’s work.  The poem in its entirety follows:</p>
<p>Magdalene-The Seven Devils</p>
<p>Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven devils had been cast out<br />
-Luke 8:2</p>
<p>The first was that I was very busy.<br />
The second &#8211; I was different from you: whatever happened to you could<br />
not happen to me, not like that.</p>
<p>The third &#8211; I worried.<br />
The fourth &#8211; envy, disguised as compassion.<br />
The fifth was that I refused to consider the quality of life of the aphid,<br />
The aphid disgusted me. But I couldn&#8217;t stop thinking about it.<br />
The mosquito too &#8211; its face. And the ant &#8211; its bifurcated body.</p>
<p>Ok the first was that I was so busy.<br />
The second that I might make the wrong choice,<br />
because I had decided to take that plane that day,<br />
that flight, before noon, so as to arrive early<br />
and, I shouldn&#8217;t have wanted that.<br />
The third was that if I walked past the certain place on the street<br />
the house would blow up.<br />
The fourth was that I was made of guts and blood with a thin layer<br />
of skin lightly thrown over the whole thing.</p>
<p>The fifth was that the dead seemed more alive to me than the living</p>
<p>The sixth &#8211; if I touched my right arm I had to touch my left arm, and if I<br />
touched the left arm a little harder than I’d first touched the right then I had<br />
to retouch the left and then touch the right again so it would be even.</p>
<p>The seventh &#8211; I knew I was breathing the expelled breath of everything that<br />
was alive and I couldn&#8217;t stand it,</p>
<p>I wanted a sieve, a mask, a, I hate this word &#8211; cheesecloth &#8211;<br />
to breathe through that would trap it &#8211; whatever was inside everyone else that<br />
entered me when I breathed in</p>
<p>No. That was the first one.</p>
<p>The second was that I was so busy. I had no time. How had this happened?<br />
How had our lives gotten like this?</p>
<p>The third was that I couldn&#8217;t eat food if I really saw it &#8211; distinct, separate<br />
from me in a bowl or on a plate.</p>
<p>Ok. The first was that. I could never get to the end of the list.</p>
<p>The second was that the laundry was never finally done.</p>
<p>The third was that no one knew me, although they thought they did.<br />
And that if people thought of me as little as I thought of them then what was love?<br />
Someone using you as a co-ordinate to situate himself on earth.</p>
<p>The fourth was I didn&#8217;t belong to anyone. I wouldn&#8217;t allow myself to belong<br />
to anyone.</p>
<p>Historians would assume my sin was sexual.</p>
<p>The fifth was that I knew none of us could ever know what we didn&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>The sixth was that I projected onto others what I myself was feeling.</p>
<p>The seventh was the way my mother looked when she was dying.<br />
The sound she made &#8211; the gurgling sound &#8211; so loud we had to speak louder<br />
to hear each other over it.</p>
<p>And that I couldn&#8217;t stop hearing it &#8211; years later &#8211;<br />
grocery shopping, crossing the street &#8211;</p>
<p>Not the sound &#8211; it was her body&#8217;s hunger, finally evident.<br />
What our mother had hidden all her life.</p>
<p>For months I dreamt of knucklebones and roots,<br />
the slabs of sidewalk pushed up like crooked teeth by what grew underneath.</p>
<p>The underneath &#8211; That was the first devil. It was always with me.<br />
And that I didn&#8217;t think you &#8211; if I told you &#8211; would understand any of this &#8211;</p>
<p>This poem, quite arguably, Howe’s finest, charts the demonic predicament many Americans find themselves in today; the possessed today are the dispossessed, for whom genuine connection, “unromantic daily love,” and the bonds of community have been broken by self-involvement and fear.</p>
<p>In “Magdalene—The Seven Devils,” Howe, the speaker, and Mary Magdalene, all overlap to form one woman adrift in a spiritual malaise.  Although the seven devils have been driven out, they are repeatedly invoked in order to be rearticulated and exorcised anew.  All of the devils are devils of the ego, devils who feed on a lack of compassion, devils confined by self-made barricades erected against understanding others.  The first devil is busyness.  The second devil is lack of empathy.  The third devil worry, the fourth, envy, the fifth, disgust for the living, the sixth, obsessive self-involvement, and the seventh, lack of appreciation for the grace that keeps us alive.  After line upon line of incantation, the image of the speaker’s mother dying brings the poem to a halt.  Howe, then, concludes with the revelation:</p>
<p>For months I dreamt of knucklebones and roots,<br />
the slabs of sidewalk pushed up like crooked teeth by what grew underneath.<br />
The underneath &#8211; That was the first devil. It was always with me.<br />
And that I didn&#8217;t think you &#8211; if I told you &#8211; would understand any of this –</p>
<p>These lines are as much a commentary on Howe’s work as a whole as they are a summary indictment of all that keeps us from each other, from genuine expressions of affection and love.</p>
<p>Howe has spent three collections of poetry bearing witness to the spiritual pitfalls of being in a world from which we will all soon depart; she has exalted the mundane as a space within which the blessed might reside.  These lines call attention to the danger that such spaces also contain. Here, Magdalene suggests, that if we are too caught up with the busyness from which we build our lives, if we invest too much sacredness in the transitory that catches us by the collar, if we honor our dead to the exclusion of those living we love, then we are still possessed and the demons will not be driven out so easily again.  The underneath is always with us.  Our sin as possessed people is not sexual, or moral, it is the sin of being unfaithful to ourselves by being too attentive to ourselves; by neglecting others, we turn our backs on the sacred.</p>
<p>These are particularly poignant thoughts when we think about the uses of poetry today.  So much of what is written is about the uniqueness of a poem’s story or the flashy surface and sound of the words.  So much is obsessive compulsive in its verbal pyrotechnics.  So much of it uses others to situate the self like so many coordinates on Google maps.  So much of it has the weight and probity of a YouTube clip.  So much of contemporary American poetry is irony uttered through a mask, confessional draining through a sieve, the visage of beauty covered with cheesecloth.  Marie Howe’s work raises a healing hand; she privileges plain song and helps us, as she helps herself, to understand what a graceful and grateful thing it is to break and break and live by breaking, even in a murderous time. <em>The Good Thief</em> begins with a quote from Hölderlin: “The danger itself fosters the rescuing power.” Howe’s poetry shows us the dangers inherent in our busy lives and, in doing so, provides a glimpse of the rescuing power.  In this way, it is a spiritual poetry, a poetry that reminds its readers what it is to love truly, with an “unromantic daily love,” the things and people of this world, in this kingdom of ordinary time.</p>
