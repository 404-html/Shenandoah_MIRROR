								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dawn came upon the Eastern Shore of Virginia when the farmers were already working.  The tomatoes were staked and tied, heavy with fruit, ready for picking.  The corn fields were tall and green, and long irrigators stretched across the square plots.  Tourists laughed and drove toward Chincoteague Island to watch the wild ponies shake the flies from their necks in the heat.  Seagulls, scanning for carrion, flew around the chicken processing factories.  Employees at Tyson and Perdue labored in bloody, fat-soaked uniforms while the chickens died screaming.  Truck drivers pushed the fifty-five mile an hour speed limit up and down Highway Thirteen, which sliced the Eastern Shore in half, while the lifeguards blew their whistles at fat men swimming too far out from the beach on Assateague National Wildlife Refuge.</p>
<p>The sun finally started to lower, and the heat left off.  In the center of the Eastern Shore there was a chicken farm, quiet now.  The catchers had come in their swirl of powder and arm stockings and sweat and caught seventy-five thousand chickens from the five houses, loaded them into cages, and fork lifted the cages onto trucks.  The last truck drove away and silence came.  Not a single person left.  The grower had gone home and the catchers were already sleeping.  All of the chickens were gone.  Except for one.  In the afternoon’s commotion, and a small fight between the forklift driver and a catcher which ended with the interference of a crew manager, somehow, one single chicken had been missed in a house of 15,000.</p>
<p>That chicken had sat, blinking in the dust as the last truck had driven off with a small Swastika hung on the top cage of the doomed chickens, a joke by one of the catchers that a trucker would later discover when he pulled into the processing plant.  The chicken was disoriented by the sudden solitude.  The heat of the day and that of 14,999 companions was gone.  The plastic dividers were gone, along with the gloved hands of catchers catching.  The water containers were raised as were the feeders.  The only things left were the filthy shavings and rice hulls and the excrement of her previous companions mixed with her own.</p>
<p>She was a she and she was all alone in the chicken house.  Four hundred feet by fifty feet of darkness looked back at the confused chicken.  Forklift tracks graced the entrance to the wide open doors, not one hundred feet from Highway Thirteen.  In the stillness, the chicken moved.  She was alive, unharmed somehow.  Left behind, saved as it were.  She did not make the trip to the factory where she would have been electrocuted, had her throat slit, plunged into boiling water and then been cut apart and wrapped into plastic and rerouted down Highway Thirteen to a grocery store somewhere on the mainland.</p>
<p>She breathed air cleaner than it had been in the fifty-one days she had been raised in the chicken house.  At a neat five pounds, two ounces, she stood up and looked around.  There was no food or water and no reason to stay still, so she walked outside into the setting sunlight.  Had she hung around she might have starved to death or, more likely the grower would have been back eventually with the next round of chickens, killing her surely, as she would not match in body weight with the new arrivals.  She left through the wide open doors and crossed the highway, surprising several tourists and one NASA employee driving home from Wallops Island.  Zigzagging, feathers flying, she made it across, kept on through several backyards and went into a small woods.</p>
<p>From there it is hard to say.  Maybe she lucked out again and found a childless, lonely couple raising chickens in their yard who would happily add her to their tiny population of ten laying hens where she could live comfortably for the rest of her life.  Or maybe she met a dog tied on a chain and was devoured by his jaws.  There is no way to tell.  But for that moment, as the sky went blue and pink over green fields and the grey ocean and bay bordering the Eastern Shore, she was walking free, breathing sweet smelling air with just a hint of salt, and making a friendly clucking into the painted evening sky.  And if I were you, I would hold on to that.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8220;This book is intended to provide intelligent girls with a scientific account of sex and human reproduction and to have the whole subject set in its proper relation to the rest of life.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="right">ATTAINING WOMANHOOD: <i>A Doctor Talks to Girls About Sex</i></p>
<p align="right">George W. Corner, M.D. 1939</p>
<p>“So there I am, flat on my back with my feet in the stirrups, Dr. Andersen has his hand up my hoo­hah, and he says ‘how many sexual partners have you <i>had</i>, Ms. Jensen?’”</p>
<p>Shelby laughs and commiserates, “How embarrassing.”</p>
<p>I finish my wine and signal the waiter for another. “Yeah don’t those guys know they’re not allowed to talk to you <i>during</i> the actual examination? Immediately before, yeah, right after, okay, but not during. How are you supposed to pretend that as a doctor, he’s not really a person, if he is asking you questions, especially about sex?”</p>
<p>“And they’re not allowed to be good looking,” Shelby adds. “Well, <i>female</i> good looking is okay. <i>Old man</i> good looking is okay. But <i>sexual being</i> good looking—never.”</p>
<p>The wine makes me laugh harder than it is funny. But Shelby and I always laugh. I try to imagine having this conversation with anybody else. Can’t do it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8220;Good things can however be overdone; and sometimes a friendship between girls oversteps the bounds of calmness and good judgement . . . and may even cause difficulty in making proper adjustments to the other sex in social life, courtship and marriage.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The happy hour mob gets noisier as it gets more crowded. Most are on the make like I would be, but with Shelby what we’re here to make is a meal. God bless free appetizers and cheap drinks. Even so, her as angel-­on­-my­-shoulder whispering in my ear is never as loud as the dude with the horns and goatee on the other side. Sometimes I think I’d test positive for a trace of Y chromosome, the way I’m in such rush to get a guy I just met into the sack, then in an all­-fired hurry to get the hell outta there after I’ve had my way with him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8220;There are certain differences between girls and boys in the expression of sex feelings. In this the male must take the lead.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shelby swirls her White Russian, watching the milk blend again with the Kahlua. “Well, what did you say? To the doctor, I mean.” She knows the truth, but can’t imagine me saying, <i>You mean I’m supposed to keep track?</i></p>
<p>“I said, ‘Well, I was in a relationship for a couple years and then I wasn’t.’”</p>
<p>“And?”</p>
<p>“And nothing. He exchanges a <i>significant glance</i> with his assistant and proceeds with the lecture on sexually transmitted diseases. It’s not like I don’t know all that stuff, so I interrupt. ‘I’m in a monogamous relationship now.’”</p>
<p>“I hope that lie was only for him.” She uses her concerned friend tone. “I mean, you’re not lying to yourself, are you?” If Shelby and I were the model for a research project, I’d say we both stand as proof a guy who thinks his love comes with ownership rights is far more dangerous to a woman than a virus. Shelby sets down her glass and squeezes my hand. “Gracie. Unprotected sex can <i>kill</i> you.”</p>
<p>“I know—and you of all people know it doesn’t take a <i>disease</i> to get the job done—but the details of my personal life are none of his business.”</p>
<p>Shelby nods. “Isn’t it ridiculous that women like us feel free to choose to have sex with whomever we wish, but feel compelled to pretend that we don’t?” Yeah, she really does talk like that. She sips her drink thoughtfully. “You know ‘nice girls don’t sleep around’ is ingrained so deeply, we’ll never be completely rid of it.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8220;Civilized mankind has a set of ideals, laws, and religious principals which aim to keep the animal part of sex under control, to surround it with the decency and dignity properly belonging to human life.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The thing about Shelby is that she always gets it. She knows my gynecologist story is about a lot of things.</p>
<p>“Yeah, the rule is that nice girls, say, <i>you</i>, get seduced or overwhelmed or drunk so you can have sex with a guy you just met. Sluts like me just act like we enjoy it.” I give Shelby my skank­-on­-the­-make, hiking up my skirt and leaning over the table so my cleavage shows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8220;Having arranged to have two sexes, nature must also provide whatever lures and attractions are necessary to bring the two sexes together at mating time.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She giggles. “Wait, I’m confused.” She does bimbo, raising a hand to her cheek in wide­-eyed confusion. “Is that your slut or seduced nice girl look?”</p>
<p>“Depends.” Laughing, I get even more into it, shimmying my shoulders to imaginary music. “Who’s doing the looking? A man I’m going to sleep with . . . or not?” I bat my eyes in chaste flirtation.</p>
<p>Shelby points out how we have managed to attract the attention of the guys at the bar and says, “I wonder if they can hear us. You know that word SLUT sure carries.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think I’ve ever used the word SLUT so much in conversation.” We emphasize the word without actually raising our voices.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8220;Good common sense backs up the standards of morality which warn us trouble lies in sexual relations other than those of marriage.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Slut, slut, slut.” Shelby says.</p>
<p>We giggle manically because the more adolescent we become, the more the boys at the bar show interest.</p>
<p>Laughter begets laughter, but before we lapse into hysteria, Shelby makes us serious again, “So Gracie, what did the doctor say? What’s wrong with you?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8220;Discussion about venereal disease, except by doctors, is indecent.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Nothing. Just some infection that cleared up with antibiotics.”</p>
<p>“Gracie. You do know that you must always use condoms.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Shelby. I usually do.”</p>
<p>“Always!” she commands.</p>
<p>“Always.” I repeat obediently.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>They arrive late to the scene, the oily smoke from the damaged vehicles diminishing to a slow pulse, soldiers going from alert attention to disinterest, then to the rooftops of the surrounding dun buildings and finally to bitter indifference, weapons leaning against their rigs as they light cigarettes or pinch fat lugs of Copenhagen between cheek and gum.  They missed the light up of the surrounding area, after Bravo 2/504 has already accidentally killed three old men in turbans in retaliation for the market bombing that has killed two of their friends.  The men were carrying canvas grocery bags filled with rice, papayas, and a leg of lamb, which is a feast out here, and unfortunately one of the men had a long black knobby walking stick that could look like a weapon in the right light, and some soldiers might wonder what they were going to celebrate with all that food anyway. It is dead center in the heat of the afternoon, and Stink can see the bristles of thirty or more angry and bored paratroopers along the rooftop, so he casually starts to look for any prizes in the blackened crater.  The dirt and rock is vaporized all the way down to the bottom, and when Stink bends into the shadow of the massive conical hole to examine some shiny metal he feels small and insignificant because the circles of discolored earth, each loop going back thousands of years, looks to him like concentric orbital rings, and there are chunks of crud here and there that seem to represent the planets, and he feels as if he is on the edge of the solar system, spinning wildly out of bounds.</p>
<p>He remembers making a diorama in Mrs. Phipps class, back when he believed he was going to be an astronaut, and he remembers that she was nice to him when all the other teachers were not. The rest of them told him he wasn’t smart enough to be an astronaut, and Stink had even caught Mr. Evans and Mrs. Dobbins joking that he was already a space cadet, but Mrs. Phipps had caught him crying even though he was too old to cry, and told him he could be anything he wanted to be, so when the Army recruiter drove the dirt roads from Lander, Wyoming, all the way out to the reservation just specially to see them, he thought it was fate when the man said he could be all he could be, because it sounded close enough.</p>
<p>Someone pops off a round at something and Stink crouches down, his M-4 across his chest and his right hand across the stock like he is pledging the allegiance, but that is all, and he hears ghostlike laughter from a group of soldiers so knows he can stand up again.  The further down he goes, the cooler it is, but he also knows that there won’t be anything at the bottom because there never is, and when there is, it is because whatever it is went straight up and then straight down and is always something horrible.  It smells bad in the massive hole though, like sewage and mold and things long dead, which is probably just because it is the ancient smell of a thousand years of this town growing from a camp to a village and then finally to a town, and Mrs. Phipps could undoubtedly tell him how long ago that was, if she were here.</p>
<p>Stink hears Corporal Binder yelling for him and he knows it is just because Lieutenant Clash found out that the rumors about the drinking cup next to his gear were true—he had been keeping a finger with a wedding band in there, under a wool sock he kept moist.  So suddenly everyone was paying him more attention and had stopped calling him Sitting Bull, but couldn’t help calling him Stink because even though he had done everything he could to keep it fresh, the finger ended up stinking real bad when they made him toss it out, and Lieutenant Clash had even been mad enough to pull the ring off the finger and toss it out to a bunch of kids disinterestedly kicking a duct taped soccer ball around outside the grounds.  Someone had been reading a book where some soldiers find a perfectly sound uncircumcised penis, and told him he should look for that, and Stink couldn’t tell if it was a joke or not, but he looked for it anyway, just thinking how weird it would be to hold a penis in your hand like that when it wasn’t even your penis!  Stink thought it would be like when Winters taped the ear from a dead insurgent to the back of his neck and joked that no one would be able to sneak up on him now, even though pretty soon after that Winters got blown up three ears and all.</p>
<p>He’s obviously not going to find any prizes down here in the hole though because even the bits and pieces of things scattered about were probably accidentally kicked in there when they were lighting up all the adobe houses, and there were footprints, which meant all the good stuff would already be taken, but even so, at the very bottom he finds what looks like a deflated jellyfish like when they get washed up on the beach, and when he kicks it with his boot toe a little piece snaps off even though it looks thick and soft, so he reaches down and it is a big ragged circle of purple and black and green and blue glass and he thinks that heating up sand is how they make glass, and he wonders how hot it had to be down there to make glass from an explosion, and picks it up and can see there are pretty bubbles inside, and he thinks maybe he can sell it at the market.</p>
<p>He is rubbing the smudges off with his camo blouse when Nunez comes up and asks him, “The fuck’s that?” but doesn’t care to even get an answer before he is looking under the vehicle for something then hopping up on the hood to light a smoke, and he is staring at the three dead old man with the grocery bags, flies already buzzing all over the place and then Nunez says, “Fuckit,” and walks over and takes the rice and papayas that don’t have blood on them, walks around a big old wet hunk of someone, and tosses it all into the back of the Humvee, same place they had put the bag that was Winters a week before.  Then Nunez goes back and gets the meat too and he rubs the blood off the leg of lamb, throws it in the back of the vehicle and explains, “The blood will wash off that meat,” lights another cigarette, shrugs, “shame to let it all go to waste,” and Stink knows that now he’ll get to keep the glass because everyone will care more about whether Nunez is going to really eat that lamb.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>June Spoon, my mother, gets mad whenever Dadio swings at flies with rolled-up newspapers.  Sometimes he swings at roaches.  He doesn’t seem to care that someone might still want to check out the news.  I hate it when he uses the sports section.  Dadio dislikes animals, insects, and most creatures of the sea.  I know he despises his kids, especially me.  He avoids petting dogs and cats.  When he’s not swatting flies, he busies himself fumigating the house with Had-A-Bug to kill mosquitoes and setting traps for rats in the attic.  He uses coconut meat for bait.  Believe it or not, he once caught a crimson cardinal.  Don’t ask me how that bird got in there, but he did.  June Spoon told me that was her father’s favorite bird.  She cried for days.  She even suggested the cardinal was the reincarnation of Pops, and that God guided him to our home so he could listen to her soothing voice drift up through the ceiling.  She said Dadio might be guilty of murder, because reincarnation gave you a second chance at life before the Final Judgment.  Dadio overheard June Spoon’s accusation and smirked, mostly because he didn’t believe in God or life-after-death or “that reincarnation hogwash.”</p>
<p>The same week as the bird murder, June Spoon fakes stomach flu to avoid sex after a bottle of Lancer’s and <em>The Ed Sullivan Show</em>.  Now she’s going to sleep long after Dadio pulls on his pajamas.  “Get to bed, June,” he scolds from their room on a windy evening, his sullen voice rattling down the hall.  June Spoon sits at the dining room table, reading a crumpled paper stained with fly guts.  “In a minute, dear,” she lies.  She bites into an Almond Mounds while perusing the Obits.  She loves it how the women outlive the men, usually by a decade and sometimes even more.  She’s certain Dadio will return either as a fly or a mosquito, one that will bug her to no end all hours of the day and night.  She prays for a fly.  She imagines a big horsefly buzzing around a hunk of snow-white coconut perched on the table.  Yesterday she bought a jumbo swatter at Long’s Drugs, a pink one with a comfy handle she hid in her bathroom cabinet under the sink.  She washes the Mounds down with  tea.  June Spoon smiles.  She imagines swatting Dadio to end his second shot at life.  She figures God won’t accuse her of murder since she’s merely avenging her father’s death as a bird.  “Eye for an eye,” she whispers into the night.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It wasn’t that she hated her husband; she just wanted something bad to happen to him. Nothing too drastic or heart-wrenching. For example, she didn’t want his new Harley Davidson to flip off the highway and impale him with its handlebars and kickstand until his body was a Swiss cheese. She didn’t want his new girlfriend, in an unbridled rage, to cut off his penis and serve it to him on a plate of wilted spinach. No. She would be content with some small mishap, something between anal leakage and cancer. Though, the more she thought about it, anal leakage was really too good for him. So she called <em>Punishment Inc. We even the score</em>, said their advertisement.</p>
<p>They had separated a few weeks before their fifteenth anniversary. Now, every weekend he came back to the house to take more things over to his new girlfriend’s place. Last weekend, he tried to remove the wall-to-wall carpet. “I paid for this carpet,” he said, jabbing at the floor with his crowbar. But she laid herself across the Saxony plush and refused to move. Unfortunately, while she was at the hardware store purchasing a new deadbolt, he returned to take the chest freezer, which was stocked with her homemade ice creams. She imagined the disgusting things he and his new girlfriend would be doing with her pistachio almond nut butter.</p>
<p>“How much would it cost to break someone’s finger?” she asked the cheerful girl on the phone.</p>
<p>“Index or pinkie?”</p>
<p>She pictured Daryl dipping his finger into her Pumpkin Swirl and licking it out of the girlfriend’s ear.</p>
<p>“Oh index, definitely.”</p>
<p>“Index breaks cost seventy-five hundred. A pinkie is five thousand. Thumbs will run you about ten thousand before tax.”</p>
<p>One finger didn’t really seem enough for all he’d put her though these last fifteen years:paying for his air conditioning repair school, Saturday afternoons at the NASCAR track, fifteen years of wiping dribbles off the toilet seat.</p>
<p>“Do you have something more emotionally devastating?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Psychological packages start at fifty thousand. Our Karma is a Bitch package includes melancholia, diminunition and erectile dysfunction. Our Wheel of Misfortune package features chronic depression, obsessive compulsive disorders and kleptomania. And, our Divine Justice Deluxe package involves deep-set suicidal ideation.”</p>
<p>She imagined all the ways Daryl might kill himself. He could hang himself in the attic<br />
with the belt she’d bought him for his forty-fifth birthday, the one with the turquoise stones he said made him look like a “cheap casino Indian.” He could lock himself in the garage with the motor running on his double-axle pickup truck, the one he insisted on buying instead of a second honeymoon trip to Hawaii. Or, he might take his father’s shotgun, which he was saving for the son they never had, and blow out his brains in the bathroom. She hoped he would have the good sense to do it at his new girlfriend’s place, but Daryl was inconsiderate enough to spatter his brains all over their marriage bed. She pictured his blood soaking into the raw silk comforter.</p>
<p>As appealing as these thoughts were, she couldn’t afford them.</p>
<p>“Too rich for my blood.”</p>
<p>“Some of our clients who want psychological effects try to achieve them through physical means. It can be less expensive. We have a very reasonable hair-loss package.”</p>
<p>She thanked the girl and told her she needed to think about it. While thinking, she remade the bed with old percale sheets and an army blanket, then replaced all the bathroom towels with dishcloths. Just in case she won the lottery.</p>
<p>***<br />
The next weekend, she looked out her window and saw a strange man on a ladder in her garage. When she came outside, she realized it was Daryl. He was completely bald.</p>
<p>“My god. What happened to your hair?”</p>
<p>Daryl had a screw driver in hand, unscrewing something from the ceiling. “Don’t know. Woke up last Tuesday, and all my hair came off in the shower. I think it might be something in the water.”</p>
<p>“That’s a shame.” She looked down at an oil stain to hide her smile.</p>
<p>“Good thing Lorena likes bald men.”</p>
<p>The mention of the girlfriend’s name sent a stitch into her gut. She pictured Lorena rubbing his scalp with her rum raisin coconut ice cream.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Taking the garage door opener. I paid for it, you know.”</p>
<p>She gave the ladder a small kick, and hurried inside to make a phone call.</p>
<p>***<br />
Two weeks had passed and Daryl hadn’t come by the house. She was curious to see if Punishment Inc. had fulfilled its contract. She had maxed out three credit cards to pay them, and acquired a small loan from the bank. She called the repair company where Daryl worked and they told her he was off sick. She drove to Lorena’s apartment complex. His car was in the lot; she parked across the street and waited.</p>
<p>Finally, just as the sun was going down, she saw Lorena exiting the building, her jumbo thighs quivering in chartreuse stretch pants. It bothered her that Lorena was older, fatter and uglier. She could at least take solace if Daryl had left her for some pretty young bimbette. But to leave her for a fat old hag in a velour track suit made it seem he was fleeing by any means possible, as if she were some war ravaged country and Lorena was UNICEF.</p>
<p>Lorena lurched to her car and spread towels over the passenger seat. Then she held open the door of the apartment building and out came Daryl. She slumped down so they couldn’t see her from across the street. Daryl’s face was covered in boils. Big pus-filled boils sprung from his forehead and the top of his newly bald skull like scoops of cherry custard. Bubbles of red blisters cascaded down his arms, swelling his hands into pink oven mitts. She high-fived the steering wheel. Punishment Inc. had surpassed expectations.  Just to see his frightened marmoset eyes peeking out from his pustules was worth the small fortune she had paid.</p>
<p>Lorena guided Daryl by the small of his back as he walked stiffly to the car. She eased him into the seat, picked up his legs and tucked them under the dashboard. She brushed something from his face and kissed his suppurating lips. It was a protracted kiss, much longer than necessary for someone in Daryl’s condition and probably not doctor recommended. Then they drove away.</p>
<p>She sat in her car for quite a long time, replaying that kiss in her mind: the slow lingering on those lips, the touching of his nubby face. There was a time when she felt such tenderness toward Daryl. In his sleep, he’d sometimes yelp and twist. She’d look over and his red face would be constricted like an angry baby. Those were the times it seemed he needed her most. She’d curl her body into his and hold him until his breathing calmed.</p>
<p>Dark descended on the street, and still, she sat there thinking. She thought about love, about tenderness and devotion. And that kindly kiss on the lips.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The night lightened to blue through the open tent flap, the humidity pressing close. No one had slept, but the show needed a new trick rider so Toby stood in the middle of the ring, sand on his boots, as Nadina stood barefoot on the mare’s back. She could feel each of Maggie’s hairs under her toes, soft yet frictioned with resin.</p>
<p>The bind of the harness sat tight against Nadina’s waist and shoulders. The leather was old and cracked but Toby had checked it before strapping her in, his chipped fingernails going white as he pulled each piece to test it.</p>
<p>He touched the whip to the horse’s flank, and Nadina felt soft knocks against her feet before she saw Maggie’s shoulders move, before she heard the mare’s hooves rise up and sink back into the sand.</p>
<p>“Arms out,” Toby called, “like a pole passing straight through you.” His voice drawled and lisped, a quiet boy now middle-aged with a cowlick and a cigarette. She nodded then stopped, feeling her head bob like a weight that could send her skittering off with one bad tilt.</p>
<p>Nadina hadn’t wanted this job. She was selling popcorn and shoveling elephant shit and waiting for the trapeze to open up. She glanced now at the bar secured high above her head. She’d been waiting to climb up there for months, the stink of salt and dirt clinging to her as she watched, night after night. Everyone saw her waiting; everyone saw her held in place. They knew she had spent her life so far on the ground, with the dust and the dirt.</p>
<p>But then last night Mario had fallen, rider down, and Toby had told her that she’d be perfect on Maggie, that her legs were strong enough to hold her still, her balance like that of a ballerina <em>en pointe</em>. He’d said that, <em>en pointe</em>, with a French accent like he’d come from another world, one Nadina hadn’t realized he’d even heard of, much less visited.</p>
<p>“I can’t,” she’d said. Balancing didn’t worry her; she’d been carrying books ten high on her head since she was five. And Toby was right, her legs were strong; all that shoveling had called up muscles she’d left long ago. Muscles she’d planned to use on the trapeze, strong enough to hold her to the bar until she let go.</p>
<p>“Try,” Toby had said. Everyone talked nearby, whispers and tears, but Toby was focused on what was needed, what could be done. He leaned closer to put his hands around her face, to pull her near. His thumbs were rough on each cheekbone, his years of handling horses right on his fingerprints.</p>
<p>Maggie walked on, her ear cocked to Toby. Soon he clicked his tongue and she started trotting, shockwaves rolling up Nadina’s spine and into her skull. “Stop,” she called, her knees bending and her hands cupping down.</p>
<p>But Toby kissed the air and Maggie broke into a canter, a rhythmic swinging that rolled under Nadina’s feet. Maggie’s mane lifted from her neck and floated down again, and Nadina imagined this felt a little like the trapeze, the air breezing by her face. Her feet relaxed against Maggie’s back and she crossed her arms to her chest, her heart steady under her right palm.</p>
<p>“Arms out,” Toby shouted. “Quit messing around.” She obeyed as if scalded, and Maggie’s ears flicked back as her weight shifted. Nadina turned to look at Toby, the harness creaking over her head. It was an old one, the harness, Toby said it hadn’t been used in ten years, not since Mario first learned to trick. Ten years, she thought, ten years on this circle. Ten years the harness had lain in a heap next to whips and bridles and surcingles, drying out and cracking and going gray. On the trapeze she’d use a new one, nylon and titanium and rigged with safety backups. She longed to feel the bar hard behind her knees as she flung herself further and further from the earth; she imagined Toby on the ground getting smaller and smaller the higher she flew, the distance between then unrolling like silk.</p>
<p>She heard the earth flying from Maggie’s hooves in clumps as they circled around; she saw the pride in Toby’s face when she turned her head. He nodded, the center of her orbit, as if she would spin around him forever.</p>
<p>Years later she would foxhunt, the horse so excited by the chase that she could feel his heartbeat through the saddle and against her thighs. She’d skim over fields balanced as a cat, stirrup bars hard against her boots, the braid of the reins tight between her fingers. The morning would press close just like this one, the sky a bare light blue, and she’d think of Toby. She’d shut her eyes, a blink, and push him away, her heels to the horse asking for flight. As if she’d been born here instead of brought. As if he’d never taught her anything at all.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/631/files/2013/09/Cribbing-Collar_Nick-Ripatrazone.mp3">Click to hear Nick Ripatrazone read &#8220;The Cribbing Collar&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Boone came home from Fort Bragg with tattoos, and a girl named Sara. Her short blonde hair was tucked behind her ears. Long, thin earrings trailed to her collarbone.</p>
<p>Boone pulled back his sleeves to show a thorned cross, ‘Gone to Hell,’ and a snake curled around a woman’s leg. Sara said that was her favorite.</p>
<p>“The scales are as green as lettuce.”</p>
<p>I imagined them in bed, her massaging his inked skin, as if her touch could bring the images to life. I felt that touch later, when Sara rested her hand on my wrist and asked if I had any beer to bring to the quarry.</p>
<p>“I’ve got half a keg of Old Milwaukee left over from a party.”</p>
<p>She smiled, and kept her hand on my wrist until Boone opened the door. She was good at making it look like nothing happened.</p>
<p><strong>~</strong></p>
<p>I was 4F from a football injury: blew out my knee sophomore year of college. I wasn’t too intent on going to Vietnam anyway. I liked it better here. I wasn’t about to leave. This was our father’s farm: he died when we were in high school. Neither of us had seen our mother since the first grade. Boone never had an interest in farming or any type of slow work. I kept horses and poultry in the back. The horses were for showing, although I had been having problems with one lately.</p>
<p>Sara asked why I didn’t go to war.</p>
<p>“Because he’s a bitch.” Boone closed the hood of the pickup and rested a boot on the bumper.</p>
<p>We’d been doing doughnuts across the quarry, Boone and Sara in the cab, me in the bed. I was hugging the half-keg, trying to keep steady against slouched bags of concrete mix. But then the hood started to steam, and Boone quit.</p>
<p>“You know we could leave it here,” I said. “We can come back after lunch and I’ll hitch it back.”</p>
<p>“You don’t think I can fix the damn truck?”</p>
<p>Sara rolled her eyes. “Who gives a shit?” She sat on the edge of the bed, legs dangling.</p>
<p>Boone parted her knees and leaned into her. “I do.”</p>
<p>I downed my cup. “Let’s walk.”</p>
<p>“And then what?”</p>
<p>“And then you and her can take my Chevy back, hitch this up, and meet me at home.”</p>
<p>He nodded. “That’s right. The way I’ve seen you hitch a truck makes me nervous.”</p>
<p>I turned to Sara and raised my hands. “Guilty.”</p>
<p><strong>~</strong></p>
<p>I had shit to do, so it didn’t matter to me. But as soon as we got back, I heard Boone screaming at her. She was tired, and didn’t want to go back to the quarry for his “stupid truck.”</p>
<p>He rushed down the stairs and swiped two beers from the fridge. They were still attached to the plastic wrap of the pack. “She’s taking a nap upstairs. She won’t bother you.”</p>
<p>That was fine. Before the long, slow work outside, I usually took a few shots of Jim Beam and then head out on the tractor, settled in the center of the wide yellow field, and just thought for a while.</p>
<p>But Sara didn’t go to sleep. She came downstairs and sat at the table with me. My shot glass was cleaned with a dab of spit worked along the bottom with my thumb, but I washed hers in the sink. We traded shots. I put away the bottle after three rounds. She asked if I could show her the horses.</p>
<p>The youngest horse had been worked up since winter. He gnawed at the top paddock rail like it was sweet.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you move him?” she asked.</p>
<p>I petted him. His breaths were even. “He does the same to the stall. If I keep him in the center he shutters and heaves. Deep breaths, and his side leans like there’s weight against it.”</p>
<p>Sara eased his face away from the rail. She knew horses. Probably from riding, not from keeping. “Why can’t you stop?” she asked him.</p>
<p>“I think he’s bored. The mind tends to wander.” I massaged his throatlatch. “I’m thinking of getting him a cribbing collar. You know, keeps him from chewing and windsucking.”</p>
<p>She shook her head. “Not if you love him.” She explained how her cousin got one for his horse, and how he made the collar too tight. She closed her hand around my neck. “Suffocated it.”</p>
<p>“Then I won’t do it.” I led her inside, hand on her back, and showed her the tractor, the wide wheels fitted with chains, the thick blade beneath. I caught her looking at me when she should have been looking at what I was speaking about. I thought it was only natural; her staring, standing close to me there. Natural, but it wasn’t going to happen.</p>
<p>I put a hand on her shoulder. “I don’t think we should do this.”</p>
<p>“Do what?”</p>
<p>She stepped back. She was looking outside. Boone was sitting on the bumper of his pickup. He looked like his service photograph: all man, no smile.</p>
<p>I thought about those photos of their orange trailer with the Texas flag hanging from a gutter. Boone and Sara on the front steps. He’d never taken photos with other girls. Sara was the one he wanted. Sara, who brushed past me as she ran out to him. He had misunderstood. We both had.</p>
<p>She raised her voice but he kept silent, as he did when he was truly angry. He kicked-in the headlights of my truck and left without her. She leaned against the bumper of my truck. Not crying, only staring. I offered her a room, but she started walking. She knew where she was going. As for me, I was going nowhere. Still.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I walk across this street exactly thirty-four times a day, dodging a dozen Brougham carriages, curricles, and Runabouts, carrying exactly twenty-two duffels of linens, thirteen wooden slat-crates of pewter dinnerware, and well over a hundred odd articles in need of cleaning or repair.  Tad Bellingham’s rocking horse is the heaviest item in recent memory, and Mary Drader’s brass lapel pin with the New Orleans Greys flag is the smallest.  Her grandpappy died in the Alamo, and the pin came from his coonskin cap.  Or so she always says through a haze of tears.  But then, heck, everyone’s grandpappy died in the Alamo these days, and it doesn’t seem like there were that many soldiers in the Siege, so there’s that niggling feeling when Mrs. Drader cries that maybe … <em>just maybe</em> … it’s simply a plain, old pin from nothing at all.  But who am I to tell Mary Drader, daughter of an English earl and founder of The Ladies Sewing Circle of Baltimore, that her grandpappy never saw Day One of the Alamo?  <em>No one</em>.  I am no one to say that to her.  My only job is to make that brass sparkle, and sparkle I make it.</p>
<p>I will never live among the richest families in Baltimore, but I know what it is to be among them, to see their fine pine balustrade staircases and their hand-carved mahogany hutches, to watch them wind their expensive music boxes and pick at the ruffles of their fancy dresses like they’re embarrassed that I’ve seen them wearing the frippery.  I will wash that frippery clean a dozen times, in all its stages of embellishment, as it receives new sashes and fabric-covered buttons and lowered, raised, lowered, raised, lowered, lowered, lowered necklines as they go in and out of fashion—anything to let society think each iteration is an entirely new frock.  I’ll show up without shame at the rear door in the same clothes I wore yesterday and each day before that, and I’ll collect those frocks and scrub them spotless in all their reincarnations.</p>
<p>Mary Drader particularly likes me to take her linens.  She has an endless supply of them, that woman.  Just as all the fine ladies of Baltimore, she prefers the linens scrubbed until they’re soft, never starched, as white as new snow, and folded very meticulously from corner to corner, then end to end, then corner to corner again.  Unlike some laundresses and seamstresses, I’ve learned that the sun at noon will bleach out the darkest stains in wet fabric—that baking soda and borax dry too stiffly, vinegar leaves a potent stench, but hydrogen peroxide is virtually undetectable.</p>
<p>Jefferson Mooring particularly likes me to take his copper.  He says I make it shine like no one else can.  Lately, I’ve gotten his pewter, too, beating out Elizabeth Ward to take on the entire dinnerware collection of one of the most prominent families in Baltimore.  I’ve learned, unlike some of the girls, that a mere kiss of lemon can scour the dullest copper pot to a brilliant luster worthy of kings and that a strange paste of flour, vinegar, and salt dried onto polished pewter will make it at least worthy of a king’s guests.  Ma taught me all she learned from her antebellum aunts before they lost their home and belongings in the Reconstruction.  What I do, I do well.</p>
<p>Today, I have to knock on a new door.  I’ve heard from Baltimore’s gossipy laundresses that it is a hard door to knock upon, for the man behind it has a scowl that would curdle milk.  I think I know what this means, but since I have only ever drunk curdled milk for the entirety of my life, this does not sink in as perhaps it should.  When Mr. Bateman—<em>the</em> Mr. Enoch Bateman—opens his door, I am instantly scrutinized.  My dark, black hair is too out of place here.  Buoyant, yellow curls and fair, unblemished skin is the fashion.  I am leathered from the sun, and I imagine he would not like that my high cheekbones and black eyes descend from the blood of the Mohegan and not from the breeding of a Yankee gentleman.  He thinks me too scrawny, too unkempt.  But there are things I have come to learn, and though his scowl is undoubtedly received by all the young maids who approach his elegant silver doorknocker, I know his scrutiny stems not from my scrawniness or my pockmarks, but rather … because I am a boy.  A boy laboring at what Mr. Bateman considers woman’s work.</p>
<p>The disgust he shows me is surely the same disgust he shows all creatures, but there is different derision reserved for a boy resigned to what this man has decidedly deemed a station for women.  Not even women: <em>girls</em>.  Mr. Bateman thrusts a duffel of linens at me, certain I cannot possibly fold them corner to corner with any expertise.  Next follows jangling pewter spoons crashing into my arms and a spavined copper cuspidor requiring polish to a shine.  His smirk says he expects the thing never to shine again and gives me a cold good-luck.  Then, there are coins, very few of them.  <em>Far too few of them</em>.  I’ll give the coins to Ma and abide the silent appraisal she’ll comb over the pitiful lot and then over her cheated son, just as I’ll abide Mr. Bateman’s silent glower that states plainly that a woman’s station is for a woman to learn; and it is for a man to learn a different place.  <em>Oh, I’ve learned</em>—learned and rejected.  He will not be so haughty when his linen is folded corner to corner, end to end, bleached with the wrath of the sun at high noon.  He’ll not stand so tall in his station when his pewter gleams for kings’ guests, when his copper shines with the kiss of lemons.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This little piggy went to market,<br />
This little piggy stayed home,<br />
This little piggy had roast beef,<br />
This little piggy had none.<br />
And this little piggy went<br />
‘Wee, wee, wee!’ all the way home.</p>
<p>The first pig went to market today but it was in pieces by then, which is a mercy, because of the way pigs always scream, it’s unforgettable, when they’re being loaded into the pickup – it’s not that they know what’s coming or anything but they don’t know what’s happening when you lift them, and as soon as their feet leave the ground they think they’re going to die then and there.  I’m telling you, pigs are never going to fly.  I used to hear that sound outside my bedroom window early in the morning and I couldn’t help but hold it against my dad.  What are you doing to them?  He figured you can get more money for a live pig at the market because people want to take it home live and get it fatter, they always think they can get it fatter.  But the way the pig thrashes and screams and curdles the blood of the whole town when you load it – I suppose if people carried around ramps for the pigs to walk up to the back of the truck – but nobody does that.  Anyway it’s such a hassle to move them that when you’re at the market and you’re hungry, you just buy a ham or ribs or whatever.  So it’s actually more lucrative, and easier, to butcher before market. Or that’s what Dad says now, anyway.<br />
•<br />
The second pig was born with only its two hind legs, so Mr. Baca appeased his three daughters and let them keep it.   He figured this would fill his daughters with admiration for his mercy and generosity, but he also suspected that the pig would die within a few weeks, would be sickly and ostracized by the sow in the meantime, and a two-legged piglet wouldn’t make for much meat even if it did last a few months, so there was nothing to lose.  Surely they only wanted a piglet anyway, not a full-blown hog, so this was perfect.  Win-win, he told Mrs. Baca in bed.  Mrs. Baca was privately distressed by her husband’s smugness, and when she looked up and caught him staring at her as she ate dinner or hung out the laundry, or when she could just make out the roundness of his open eyes in the moonlight long after she thought he’d fallen asleep, she imagined that he was estimating her own life span and calculating how to manipulate it.  So in secret, she advised her young daughters how care to for the piglet as if it were a baby, and told them a story she’d heard of a pig born with two legs in a neighboring town, which had grown to adulthood and even learned to walk like a person.   The sisters kept the pig in a blanketed basket on the porch, so that the sow wouldn’t trample it or crush it in her sleep, and while the piglet grew surprisingly plump, Mrs. Baca became increasingly proud.  Mr. Baca started to sleep on the couch.  And when one morning the basket was found empty, Mrs. Baca stopped sleeping in their bed too.  The youngest daughter never cried at all, but wandered into the kitchen several nights in a row, trying to fit frozen cuts of pork and beef back together.<br />
•<br />
The pigs are eating my son.  He was led quietly out of the pasture, butchered, and most of him sold, the rest roasted by the family, except the hooves, budding horns, tail and other unwanted things, which were given to the pigs.  I watch the pigs from my pasture and I see them rooting and snapping, snapping up a cricket, a slug, then a frog, a mouse.  One of them snapped off two toes of the middle daughter as she lay daydreaming in the grass, and was butchered soon after.  They sold the meat that grew off the meat of their child.  Meat is always mixing.  I will be mixed into it, sooner or later, sooner and later, in a kind of immortality, an everlasting death.<br />
•<br />
This piglet was, you could say, a purist.  It has had nothing to contaminate it.  Meat?  It has had none.  Vegetable matter?  None.  A suckling pig is just that, fed only from the mother’s teat.  Exquisitely tender, especially here at Dolora’s where we select them individually from trusted sources at the market, slaughter them humanely and hygienically, stick them, and rotate them very slowly in a clay oven at a low temperature.  A suckling pig takes an entire day to prepare, you will find.  And that is why it is the most expensive dish on the menu, to answer your question.  You will not be disappointed!<br />
•<br />
I ran.  They put me in a crate for an hour and covered me in grease and set me down in a dusty corral.  Then they released the children.  The children chased me through massive hoof prints and baking shit, snatched at me, scraped at me with their open-closing eagle hands, they pulled my tail, my legs, tripped me so I could barely twist away, and I screamed and the children screamed back louder, teeth shining.  A gate had been left slightly ajar and I slipped through it and I ran, ran out, ran away.  I ran all the way home and hid underneath my mother in the familiar hay, shaking until I fell asleep in her dark warmth.  Now I am back in the crate.</p>
