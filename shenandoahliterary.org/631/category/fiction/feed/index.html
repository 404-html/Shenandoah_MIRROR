								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paul Kaminski hated his job…not so much the exhausting hours spent at the machines, pulling taut wire across cut corn stalk, but the bastards that ran the joint. Paul had worked at lots of jobs over the years since he and the other doughboys shipped home from Europe: as a grease monkey on the Pennsylvania Railroad, a cobbler in a shoe factory, a watchman at Philadelphia’s sewer farm. He’d even survived the Spanish Flu, his stubby body turning blue for half a day before his Mama nursed him back. But the Micks that ran the broom factory had it in for Polacks and they’d stuck Paul right next to that Nigra, Jordan.</p>
<p>Even seated, Jordan towered over his machine, a head and shoulders taller than Paul. His coal black skin made him almost disappear on the shop floor – where the only light shone from dingy lamps hanging from the rafters and through high yellowed windows. Jordan sang Negro church songs. His baritone voice boomed over the clatter of the stitching machines. He laughed when Paul complained.</p>
<p>“You neva’ heard nothin’ so sweet, Mista Paul. Nothin’ so pretty.”</p>
<p>“You gotta learn to speak English. I can’t understand half of what you’re singin’.”</p>
<p>“At least my songs is in English, boss. The ones in you-all’s church is Latin or some such gibberish.”</p>
<p>Paul grinned. Jordan had him there. “Yeah, yeah. But it’s proper gibberish.”</p>
<p>He hadn’t gone to church regularly since he’d left home for the war. But he remembered the one time his Mama, dressed in her best Sunday coat and wearing a hat shaped like a helmet, took him to high mass at St. Augustine’s. The choir sang Gregorian chants, the men’s bass voices sounding like the rumble of distant guns, only with better harmony.</p>
<p>The broom factory overlooked the Delaware River, right across from Camden. After a ten-hour day, Paul walked five blocks to the streetcar and rode it north to Kensington, to a two-story brownstone, a wife and a couple teenage daughters. Before he’d climb on the streetcar, he’d down a few drafts at Sully’s, one of many taverns that opened right after the end of Prohibition. After gulping the beer he wished his bosses would waltz through the doors so that he could tell them where they could stick their broom handles. But while his mind filled with thoughts of payback and hazy images of the war, of dead soldiers lying at the bottom of muddy trenches, his body sat motionless on the barstool, and he seldom spoke with anyone.</p>
<p>After they’d been working side-by-side for a couple weeks, Jordan began following Paul after work. They walked in silence, the Negro a step or two behind. Along the way, they’d pass the rag picker’s wagon, the old nag and its owner slowly clip-clopping their way home. When the broom makers reached Sully’s Paul heard, “Sees ya tomorrow, boss,” and Jordan turned down a narrow cobblestone lane. At first he feared Jordan might jump him, steal his pocket watch and the five dollars in his wallet. But after a few weeks, he figured that it was good to have the big man dogging him, good protection against the bums that might waylay a straggling worker and pick him clean.</p>
<p>Paul got to know all the songs Jordan sang and would ask for his favorites. On a hot July afternoon, he leaned back on his leather seat, wiped the sweat from his eyes with his shirt sleeve, and listened to Jordan sing &#8220;Come Down, Angels.&#8221; The dye crew had just finished dipping a batch of the Mexican broomcorn into the aniline vats to give it a green industrial color. Other men collected dried stalks of different grades from the racks, dunked them in barrels of water for a few seconds then hustled to re-fill the boxes next to each of the 14 broom makers’ stations. Paul continued attaching stalks to the handles by binding their ends against the shaft with thick silver wire, his fingers crooked from years of tugging the taut wire into place. He worked carefully but quickly and in a few minutes laid a broom on a half-loaded pallet to be pulled to the drying area. Across the stifling hall, some fat-assed foreman yelled “move it, move it, move it,” and the crew hurried to feed dried brooms between rollers to remove the seeds, then into a press that bent the strands to the desired flat shape and stitched across them to hold it. When Paul heard the foreman, he clenched his fists and muttered, &#8220;What an ass.”</p>
<p>After Paul worked for a couple of hours, his machine started to whine. Climbing from his seat, he knelt and saw that a big chunk of broom stalk clogged the belt drive. He reached in to clear it, the belt wheel spun and his hand caught in the track. Paul screamed. Heads along the line turned toward him – gaunt faces with wide-spaced eyes, Italians, Polacks, Irish, Jews, Germans, Lebanese. They all stared, but didn’t move.</p>
<p>Jordan lunged toward him, and hit the breaker bar that disconnected Paul’s machine from the power drive. Rolling the belt wheel back, Paul yanked his hand free. Angry-looking cuts sliced the insides of the fingers on his left hand. Streams of crimson dribbled onto the factory floor. His heart pounded and he fell sideways onto the concrete.</p>
<p>“Get the hell outta here, Stumpy, and take care of that hand,” Moran, the shift foreman yelled. “And make it quick. I got a bunch of guys outside itchin’ to take your place.”</p>
<p>Everybody except Jordan called him Stumpy since Paul barely cleared five foot two.</p>
<p>In the stinking latrine, Paul held his bleeding fingers under the water tap. He fumbled in his dungarees, pulled out a half-pint of rye, and sloshed some whiskey over the wounds then some into his mouth. Yellow spots with dark rings floated in his eyes and he stumbled. Black hands caught him and guided him to the bench.</p>
<p>“You take it easy, Mista Paul. We’ll get that tied up real quick.”</p>
<p>With surprisingly nimble fingers for a big man, Jordan folded a bright neckerchief and wrapped the hand, tying the fingers together so that the pressure squeezed the wounds shut. The hand throbbed but the bleeding stopped.</p>
<p>“We’d better get back,” Paul said. “They’re gonna dock us for slowing down.”</p>
<p>“Don’ you worry, boss. We’ll leave when we’s good and ready.”</p>
<p>“Like hell. I won’t have ’em kickin’ us into the soup lines.” Paul pushed himself up and they returned to their stations.</p>
<p>That night after work, they walked their normal route. Paul finished the rye, to kill the pain he told himself. At Sully’s, he stopped and turned to Jordan. “You really got me out of a jam today. Ya wanna come in and have a beer? I’m buyin’.”</p>
<p>Jordan stared openmouthed for a moment. “I ’preciate your offer, Mista Paul, but they won’ serve me in there.”</p>
<p>“Sure they will. I’m a regular. They’ll do what I tell ’em.”</p>
<p>“No sir, they won’t. But thanks for offerin’.” Jordan turned and strode along the narrow street, kicking at tin cans and other garbage strewn across the cobblestones. Paul shook his head and pushed through the tavern doors to the sound of Sully calling, “Hey, Stumpy.”</p>
<p>During the summer of ’35, Philadelphia really cooked, with brownstone tenants sleeping on open porches or roofs, awaiting any feeble breeze off the river to provide relief.  But the dockside breweries aired out their kettles at night which stank up half the city. At the broom factory, the bosses put on a night shift to handle the extra orders and the warehouses emptied out. Paul wondered why brooms and booze sold so well with the streets still full of out-of-work men.</p>
<p>“They ’bout workin’ us to death,” Jordan complained one lunch break.</p>
<p>“You better believe it. The Micks are makin’ money hand over fist. Like that old song, ‘The rich get rich and the poor get children’.”</p>
<p>Jordan grinned. “Ain’t that the truth. I’ve got four of my own.”</p>
<p>Paul eyed the factory door, making sure Moran and the other foremen weren’t near enough to hear. They sat outside in the building’s stifling shade along with the other workers, sweating, and devouring their cold sausages, cheese, and biscuits during the half-hour lunch break. Paul pulled his battered canteen from his haversack, one of many Army souvenirs, and drained half its contents, a diluted version of the raisin wine his wife still made in their basement. He stared at Jordon. The black man’s head leaned against the corrugated metal siding, gray-haired at the temples, eyes closed.</p>
<p>“You want some of this?” Paul offered.</p>
<p>“Nah. If I drink that stuff, I gets sleepy and wind up losin’ fingers.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but ya wouldn’t feel it.” Paul chuckled. He pulled his white bone fife from the pack and played Army songs he’d learned while bivouacing along the Piave Front. Jordan hummed along.</p>
<p>That Saturday the bosses really pushed them. When two of the machines broke, they worked the crew through their lunch break to make up for lost production. After work, Paul and Jordan staggered toward the streetcar and Sully’s, not talking, just putting one foot in front of the other. At the tavern, Paul clamped onto Jordan’s arm before he could leave.</p>
<p>“Come on, ya gotta want a cold beer. Let me buy ya one.”</p>
<p>“That sounds real good, boss,” Jordan said. “But I told ya, they won’t serve no Nigra in that place.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well tonight they’d better, God damn it.” Paul pushed Jordan toward the swinging doors, the black giant dwarfing the balding white man. Paul had lost most of his hair – from the mustard gas attacks, or so the corpsmen had claimed.</p>
<p>The crowd quieted when they entered and climbed onto barstools. A half-dozen of the factory bosses sat at a corner table covered with empty pitchers. Moran glowered at the duo.</p>
<p>“Give us a couple drafts,” Paul told Sully.</p>
<p>The bartender backed up, folded his arms, and glared. “I ain’t gonna serve no ’coon in my place.”</p>
<p>“See, I tolds ya, Mista Paul. I’ll just be goin’ and–”</p>
<p>Jordan began to slide off the stool but Paul reached over and grabbed his arm. Jordan’s muscles felt like tight steel bands. “Just stay put.” He stared at Sully. “So ya wanna play it that way, huh? Set one up for me.”</p>
<p>The bartender hesitated but reached for a mug, held it under the tap and filled it to the brim. He set it in front of Paul who drained half the glass then slid it over to Jordan.</p>
<p>“Here, finish it for me, will ya?”</p>
<p>Jordan grinned. “Sure will, boss.”</p>
<p>After Jordan downed the rest of the beer, Paul retrieved the empty and shoved it toward Sully. “Set me up again.”</p>
<p>Sully snatched the mug and flung it against the brick wall at the far end of the bar. It exploded into shards that dropped to the floor, raining down on slumped-over patrons.</p>
<p>“Nobody’s gonna drink from a glass that a ’coon’s drunk from, not in my place.” Sully’s voice shook.</p>
<p>“That ain’t none of my business, just set me up another.” Paul slammed his fist against the counter. Jordan raised his head and stared coldly at the bartender.</p>
<p>Sully complied and in a few minutes another mug smashed against the wall. The drinking and destruction continued for four or five rounds. The bar crowd thinned out. For a time, Paul felt immune to the danger that surrounded them, almost like his blurred memories of northern Italy, with the Hun’s machine guns rattling, the damn Lieutenant blowing a whistle and yelling at them to move out, move out, move out, and the muddied soldiers crawling from the trenches to face a curtain of lead. The memory of the Lieutenant’s red face, yelling, made his own cheeks burn.</p>
<p>The factory bosses at the corner table stood and moved toward them.</p>
<p>“Time ta pay up,” Paul announced and laid a crumpled dollar on the counter. Jordan slid from the stool and shook his broad shoulders, like a prize fighter before moving to center ring. The bosses stopped in their tracks.</p>
<p>“Thanks for the beer, Sully. Ya better clean up that mess,” Paul said, pointing to the pile of broken glass, “or somebody’s gonna get hurt.”</p>
<p>They walked slowly along the bar and pushed through the swinging doors. But once on the street the broom makers tried to control their laughter as they hurried away.</p>
<p>“Sorry about that, Mista Paul. You won’ be drinkin’ in that place no more.”</p>
<p>“Don’t matter to me. There’s plenty of other joints.”</p>
<p>“Maybe, I can take you to the club near my place. Nobody ’ll bother you so longs as you’re with me.”</p>
<p>“Jesus, Jordan. I’ll have ta think about that one.” Paul laughed.</p>
<p>On Monday morning, Paul found a new guy working at Jordan’s machine. He waited until lunch to confront Moran in the office where the higher ups ate their meals under the spinning blades of a ceiling fan.</p>
<p>“So what the hell happened to Jordan?” Paul demanded.</p>
<p>“Why should you care about that Nigra?”</p>
<p>“He made brooms better than anybody on the line. You’d have to be real stupid to fire somebody like that.”</p>
<p>“You callin’ me stupid, Stumpy?” Moran unfolded his barrel-chested body from the chair and stood in front of him, almost touching.</p>
<p>“My name is Paul.”</p>
<p>“Whatever you say, Stumpy…and you’d better watch it or you’ll find somebody new workin’ your machine.”</p>
<p>The other foremen in the office sniggered. Paul spun and left them there, laughing. He walked outside, slumped against the building, and watched the heat waves wiggle up from the tarmac. Another line from the old song came to him – The rich get rich and the poor get laid off. He ground his teeth.</p>
<p>The next day at lunch, Paul retrieved his Army haversack from the cloakroom, sneaked up to the office door, pulled the pins from two fragmentation grenades, and rolled them into the room filled with Moran and his buddies. Paul ran and crouched behind his machine.</p>
<p>The explosions rocked the building, shook the dust from its rafters and filled its cavernous interior with acrid smoke. Paul stood and stared, his hands clenching and unclenching, his small body shaking. Minutes passed before distant sirens and clanging bells broke the eerie silence. Paul slipped out a side door and joined the other workers milling about the yard.<br />
They’ll blame it on the unions and their commie pinko leaders, Paul thought. In his mind, he saw clearly the Army Lieutenant blowing that damn whistle and shrieking at the troops to move out, saw the exhausted soldiers stare back with dull eyes before they took cover behind the sandbags, refusing to commit suicide. Why had that screaming bastard tried to force their hand? Why had Moran done the same?</p>
<p>That evening Paul guzzled beer at a different tavern down the line and listened to the background stories about work, kids, and mayhem.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The December 2004 administration of the Israeli Halakha Standards and Kosher Certification Board Exam, Level III: Advanced took place in a nondescript conference room on the third floor of the Jerusalem Gate Hotel. Twenty-five takers were in attendance, most of them progenies of well-regarded clans or has-been dynasties spanning the Pale and Carpathians. A few sprung from squalid development towns—Sderot, Netivot, Yeruham—or other rotting lands in the south. All were equally in-bred, and all were well-prepared for the test.</p>
<p>Shlomo Lipshitz was not. He sat sweatily in back, gripping the desk of his writing chair, biting his lip, cupping his beard, deliberately avoiding eye contact with the furry-faced behemoth in front, a shiny-toothed <i>Litvak</i> named Yakov, who proctored in a glittering frock-coat. He was mumbling phrases inaudibly, lost in contemplative prayer, or otherwise trying to impress them. Shlomo should have paid him off. Across the aisle to his right sat Yossi, a smarmy Moroccan, grandson of the Sephardic Chief Rabbi, thick-lidded, round, and looking as if he might well have consumed his own weight in <i>shakshouka</i> that morning. He gave Shlomo a tomato-smeared grin.</p>
<p><i>Question 39: After the liver is broiled and the outer juices have stopped flowing, how many times must the liver be rinsed under a stream of cold water?</i></p>
<p>Fuck this, Shlomo figured. He reached in his <i>rekel</i>, which was bunched below his desk, parted his tzitzit, and unsnapped the leather box of his tefillin. Then he pulled out a small strip of parchment on which he had scribbled some notes.<i> </i>Beside him, the Moroccan just leered.</p>
<p>Shlomo knew it was written here somewhere between bugs and the boiling of kitchen utensils.</p>
<p><i>Three</i>, he marked on the test. Then he whispered to the <i>shvartze</i> beside him: “God comes to us in multiple ways.”</p>
<p>Shlomo&#8217;s big break as a kosher inspector came a couple years later, when he discovered two or three shrimp shells inadvertently dropped into a package of cod. The order, which had been placed by some upstart caterer near Kiryat Yam, had fallen under the supervision of the municipal rabbinate, which had neglected its watch. Shlomo, as the Deputy Regional Inspector, was actually tipped off by a friend of his, a classmate from <i>kollel</i>, who owed him a ride.</p>
<p>There was hell to pay in Jerusalem. Three rabbis were fired—or not promoted, to be exact—and Shlomo&#8217;s picture was displayed in the <i>Chief Rabbinate&#8217;s Weekly</i>, which was circulated on all the important blocks in the capital and distributed as far west as Toronto. The article cited him as an “exemplary” inspector, one who is “G-d-fearing, properly trained, and responsible in all he undertakes.” He even got to pose in a <i>shtreimel</i>, an enormous fur cap, which he didn&#8217;t even own. Three weeks later, he was married to the Mir Yeshiva head&#8217;s daughter and employed as a Sabbath supervisor at the new Laromme Hotel in Jerusalem. Things were looking up.</p>
<p>Then, in 2007, he committed a gaffe. As a side-project, and in effort to get his name out—he had hopes of becoming a district supervisor, if not more gainfully employed—he had founded a rent control committee in the Sanhedria neighborhood of Jerusalem, where landlords were gouging their tenants. Similar groups had been founded in Bnei Brak and other telescoping tenements. What he hadn&#8217;t counted on was the owners being patrons of Shas, the largest rival party, and <i>Sephardim</i> to boot. Normally, one could negotiate with these people, and pretty much anyone wearing a hat. But when he showed up at the offices of <i>Deri &amp; Yishai</i>, intending to outline his plans, and possibly squeeze them, he found none other than Yossi, his four-ton nemesis, sitting at the desk, picking an olive from his teeth.</p>
<p>“Multiple ways,” Yossi said. Then he thumbed through the sheets of his prayerbook. “How&#8217;s the new wife holding up?”</p>
<p>Twelve hours later, Shlomo was reassigned to the most isolated patch of the Negev, overseeing the kosher inspection for a senior citizens&#8217; home near Ofakim. To call the place desolate would have complimented the region. Actual scorpions crept along the sand, which had more the consistency of rock, and even in May, when he arrived, the thermometers simmered at 47°C. “I guess God wills it,” said his wife, who detested him but didn&#8217;t say a word, apart from that. She and their two kids settled comfortably into their pink-walled, swamp-coolered condo, which was in an eight-story building, ironically enough, despite being 3km from the next. Shlomo, for his part, only visited the center once or twice-a-week, just enough to watch people die. Most afternoons, he played cards in the park and lingered around the yeshiva, dipping his toes in the bath or haggling with Bukhari merchants over the price of their babkas, which were obviously inflated, even for him. He took up smoking, as well.</p>
<p>Fortunately, things played out to his favor in Jerusalem. Yossi suffered a stroke at age 36, which wasn&#8217;t unexpected in his circles—they all ate a lot—but he hadn&#8217;t even made it to the hospital in time to stabilize his brain. The result was that he had gone comatose—an awful, squishy state—and any other people would have pulled the plug. Shlomo visited him in the hospital once and felt a slight shred of compassion: the thin charcoaled eyes, the scintillating mask, the cables affixed to his jugular, like some massive shrimp. Shlomo thought about pulling the cord himself. Then he stepped out for a smoke.</p>
<p>Twenty months later, his nemesis was dead, and Shlomo was called back to Jerusalem, where he attained a well-deserved sinecure as the Sabbath Inspector of the David Citadel Hotel. His wife, who had borne him two more, was elated, albeit unanxious to move. She also disliked moving back near her father, at whose home they were expected to gather each Friday night. That is, everyone in the clan except Shlomo, who made his rounds at the hotel.</p>
<p>One Friday evening around six, as a golden sun steamed through the clouds, igniting the cliffs of Talbiya and spraying warm light on his suite, Shlomo got up from the loveseat. He had been watching <i>Jeopardy</i>, sipping a good Cabernet (for which he had directed the import and levied a not-unreasonable tax), picking the jam from his toes, when it occurred to him that he deserved better than this. His father, a hapless shoe merchant from Netanya, had told him that nothing would come of this “life,” this newfound devotion he attained at age 17, when he&#8217;d moved to a Haifa yeshiva and taken up the calling of God. Shlomo wasn&#8217;t technically ordained as a rabbi, but he had always been spiritual, and he did His work. Hell, he married a hag and had children—four of them, from what he could tell—and prayed most weekends at the Wall. He was fairly compassionate. He never overtaxed the religious and always gave alms to the poor. And he had never actually cheated anybody—that is, asked for an outright bribe. At least not without reasonable grounds. He was diligent with his reports. He didn&#8217;t aim to be a district supervisor any longer, but his wife deserved more than a two-bedroom flat on some derelict block in Sanhedria. And his Audi needed new tires.</p>
<p>He closed the drapes. He tightened his frock-coat. Then he picked up his half-emptied wineglass, wrapped it in a towel, dropped it on the floor, and stomped it. The shards were still settling in the bin when the deadbolt clamped in his door.</p>
<p>Downstairs, he made his usual trek through the lobby, where George, the Assistant GM, was berating a security guard for having patted down a foreign head of state. A red dusky light checkered the carpets, the wrought-iron tables, the porcelain trays—all of this secular crap. Outside, the wind loudly whipped at the pool. Must have been a <i>khamsin</i>. He could hear its hum through the glass.</p>
<p>As Shlomo barged through the swinging doors of the restaurant&#8217;s kitchen, without warning, of course, he heard a thousand plates fall. Moses himself couldn&#8217;t have exuded such power. In the center, beneath the hood of a vent and above a steel counter with plates, a goateed chef looked back at him in panic. “Rabbi,” he peeped.</p>
<p>Shlomo just studied his thumb. He knew right away what had happened. The wind had blown out the stoves&#8217; central pilot light, but the sun had already set. Six hundred chicken breasts cooled on trays along the wall, and a half-dozen servers were scrambling, unsure of how they&#8217;d proceed.</p>
<p>“Go ahead, light it,” Shlomo said to the chef, a <i>kibbutznik</i> named Ron, who wasn&#8217;t even supposed to be working now.</p>
<p>“But what about—”</p>
<p>“Go ahead. Do it. See if I care.” Shlomo eyed a young female server, an Arab, with copper-green eyes. He gave her a sumptuous wink. Then he approached Ron&#8217;s counter, where a huge saucer of gravy was resting. He dipped his thumb in the pool, licked it, and turned to the five or six servers, all of whom were huddled by the door, waiting to hear his pronouncement. “I think it would be a shame to close you guys down now. What, with the delegation coming.” The Mideast Quartet was dining that night in the ballroom, and what seemed like half the UN was expected to arrive for brunch.</p>
<p>The gravy tasted liquidy, dull. “Ron,” Shlomo dried off his hand on his frock-coat, slowly fingered his beard. “Let me ask you a question.”</p>
<p>Ron stared straight above the plates.</p>
<p>“How long have you been in this business?”</p>
<p>“Twenty-seven years.”</p>
<p>“Any kids?”</p>
<p>“Just a couple.”<br />
“That&#8217;s nice. Do you feel this place is a success?”</p>
<p>Ron didn&#8217;t flinch. He had the look of death in his eyes. “I guess.”</p>
<p>“Hmm.” Shlomo turned to the young Arab server. “What&#8217;s your name, sweetheart?”</p>
<p>She glowered at him, bravely.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m sorry, I didn&#8217;t catch that.”</p>
<p>“Nahla.” She grinned.</p>
<p>“What a beautiful name, Nahla. What does that mean?”</p>
<p>“Drink of water.”</p>
<p>“I see.” He turned to Ron, who was quivering beneath his white chef&#8217;s hat. “You know, I&#8217;d like a drink of water.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>Then Shlomo spun around to the hall, to the extent one can spin in a frock-coat. He brushed the door&#8217;s slanted mezuzah and gave the young girl a passing tap on the back—like David seducing Bathsheba, he figured.</p>
<p>Outside, George was scrambling over through the lobby, brushing past the legions of security guards and mustached UN personnel. “Rabbi,” he pleaded. “I was going to tell you about the stove. There&#8217;s nothing we can do. We couldn&#8217;t ask a goy to light it, and the timers are already set.”</p>
<p>“Just do what you wish,” Shlomo said.</p>
<p>“But what about the license?”</p>
<p>“What about it?”</p>
<p>“How can we be sure it&#8217;s okay?”</p>
<p>“God has his ways.”</p>
<p>Shlomo didn&#8217;t bother to come down for dinner that night. He didn&#8217;t have to. He chose to eat in his suite. The chicken was cold, but definitely reheated, and it arrived on a long silver tray, along with a vintage Bordeaux and a chilled green bottle of Perrier. Beneath it was a manager&#8217;s enveloped stuffed with pink bills—banded 200&#8217;s—and an unstruck, newly-torn match.</p>
<p>Shlomo&#8217;s suite was actually meant to accommodate his family—it featured two adjoining rooms—though he kept the doors closed in effort to ward off the ghosts: the ghosts of his father, now dead, his nemesis, Yossi, and his mentor, the <i>Litvak</i>, whom no one else liked but appropriately feared, since that was the only passable way.</p>
<p>He flipped through the bills, smelling their stack. Then he dumped them all out in the trash. Money meant nothing to him now, just part of his earthly abode. He wasn&#8217;t sure why he was feelings this. But the sight of it rankled his chest.</p>
<p>Fuck his new tires and his wife. He grabbed the Bordeaux, uncorked it, and laid himself down on the bed.</p>
<p>At around three am, he heard a soft knock on his door. He stirred on his pillow, opened his eyes, and realized that his pay-per-view porn was still on. He reached for his kippah and rose, winding through the suite in his bathrobe. Peering through the peephole, he saw a young girl looking down, shielding her face with her palm. It was Nahla, of course. His drink.</p>
<p align="center"> # #</p>
<p> “So here&#8217;s the plan,” her uncle told her that morning, inside the Daheisha Refugee Camp, 12km south of Jerusalem. “You&#8217;ve got to kill a Jew. I don&#8217;t care how you do it. I don&#8217;t care if you die. The payment is 12,000 <i>sheks</i>.”</p>
<p>That was it, Nahla realized. That was the worth of her life, excluding the cost of her funeral and the fees for rebuilding their house. Both would be deducted, of course.</p>
<p>Her uncle was munching on a date as he said it, a waxy <i>medjool</i>, propping his shoes on a floormat she&#8217;d cleaned the past night. He was wearing his Yankees cap backwards, as he always did, and watching <i>Arab Idol</i>.</p>
<p>“And what if I back out?”</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t look up. He just spat his pit at the set. It clunked against the screen and bounced into a fake potted palm—a well-practiced shot.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Muna dashed in from the store. “Abu Jabri said he can&#8217;t help us any more. But he gave me an ice cream and drink.” Her clueless little sister, still clad in her navy-striped school dress, was slurping a Fanta and holding a half-melted Magnum on a stick. Then, as if on cue, they heard their father&#8217;s moans from upstairs: at first, a soft whimpering, then shuddering cries, as if the life were being squeezed from his veins. Another round of chemo would kill the man. That&#8217;s if they could afford the next cab.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ll do it,” she told her uncle, “on two conditions. First, Muna doesn&#8217;t stay in this house. You&#8217;ll let her live with her aunt in ad-Doha”—a neighboring village, outside the camp, where she wouldn&#8217;t live in squalor and fear of bi-nightly arrests. “And two, before I go, you&#8217;ll let me spend time with Jaffar”—a neighbor who had repeatedly courted her, and whose marital requests her family had repeatedly denied. It wasn&#8217;t that he wasn&#8217;t good-looking. He was simply, unequivocally poor. And they had always entertained high hopes for their eldest. At least until the cancer set in.</p>
<p>“If you want to whore yourself out, feel free. But your handlers will meet you at one. You&#8217;ll pick up the explosives vest when you get past the checkpoint, inside the monastery gardens. As for Muna, that&#8217;s fine.”</p>
<p>She would have considered it further, but she had already made up her mind. She&#8217;d put in the request six months ago, though the Islamists wouldn&#8217;t accept. So she had turned to her uncle, a crude UNRWA janitor, who had ties with the nationalist groups. They were less reliable and even more misogynistic, but better-funded and seeking recruits. They had also found her a job, through covert channels, at a Jerusalem hotel, where Palestinians weren&#8217;t normally employed.</p>
<p>“Come here.” She hugged her little sister. Then she grabbed her thin, sticky hand. “I want you to run down to Jaffar&#8217;s and tell him to come here at once.”</p>
<p>“I hope he gives you a ring,” said her uncle.</p>
<p>“I hope your wife doesn&#8217;t get fat.”</p>
<p>After Muna dashed off, Nahla bathed, said her prayers, and visited her father upstairs. With the help of two militants, she recorded a video of herself draped in red flags, clutching a rifle, and professing support for their cause.</p>
<p>Then Muna rushed in with a reply. “Jaffar&#8217;s still out at Efrat. He won&#8217;t be back until six.”</p>
<p>That figures, Nahla thought. She kissed her pale father goodbye.</p>
<p>Downstairs, as she reapplied lipstick in her mirror, she noticed her lips were too chapped. The militants had told her that that could be a telltale sign to security. But it was clearly from the <i>khamsin</i>. Outside, through the bathroom&#8217;s slatted grey window, a particled wind choked the camp, swarming through laundry, slabs of cement, and the chalky green leaves of a loquat, which she had once planted herself. Now all she wanted was to see the tree demolished. She could feel the hot wind in her throat. The going would be rough through the checkpoint, she realized, assuming traffic still crossed. Then she&#8217;d detonate herself outside the hotel, or wherever she encountered some guards.</p>
<p>In the kitchen, she smeared some olive oil on her lips and retrieved her late mother&#8217;s sunglasses—an oversized tortoiseshell pair, like the kind that Umm Kulthum wore. Her life had been miserable, as well. Everyone&#8217;s was, she supposed.</p>
<p>“Good luck,” said her uncle, bidding her adieu. “May God grant you peace and good health.”</p>
<p align="center"> # #</p>
<p> “Good evening,” said the girl, as Shlomo slowly opened his door.</p>
<p>He looked at her face, those soft Arab cheeks, the pouty, wet folds of her lips. She was wearing sunglasses, too, which she hadn&#8217;t worn downstairs. But her nametag clearly said Nahla, and it was pinned to her uniform&#8217;s vest. She also wore a matching blue skirt and white dress shirt with scarf, beneath which her massive breasts bulged. “May peace be upon you,” he said.</p>
<p>Diffidently, she entered, looked about the suite, and studied the tall windows&#8217; glare. The curtains were drawn, and a wild orange light flitted in: the illumined stone walls of the Old City beyond, compounded with the sweltering dusk. It looked truly biblical, he realized. Like some heathenish plague, or a curse.</p>
<p>“Al-Quds,” he said, using the Palestinian name.</p>
<p>“Jerusalem.”</p>
<p>“Are you Muslim?”</p>
<p>She grinned, watching him retrieve two crystal flutes from a glass-covered, wall-mounted shelf.</p>
<p>“Then I guess you don&#8217;t drink.”</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s a first time for everything.” Smirking, she removed her black sunglasses and let down her long walnut hair.</p>
<p>As he bent to the fridge and pulled out a bottle of Clos Du Mesnil, &#8217;98 (she was worth it, he figured, even if she was a bit overweight), he tried not to take his eyes off her, but he noticed she was watching the trash.</p>
<p>“Are those real?” she asked, referring to the discarded Shekels.</p>
<p>“Nothing is real in my life.” He untied the cork and it popped. Foam drizzled onto the carpet, along with his robe and his hands. His pajamas were silk, and the stain would be hard to get out. Not as hard as blood, though. This girl was a vision from God. “Do you want them?”</p>
<p>She eyed him fiercely, as if too enraged to respond.</p>
<p>“How old are you?” he asked her.</p>
<p>“Nineteen.”</p>
<p>“And you&#8217;ve never been with a man?”</p>
<p>“Is that what you are?”</p>
<p>“If you want to leave, that&#8217;s fine. I&#8217;m not asking you to do anything you don&#8217;t want.” Still smiling, he held out a bubbling glass.</p>
<p>Slowly, she approached him and took it. She sipped it, coughed, and set the glass on the desk. He took her hand and pulled her into his chest. She smelled of perfume—some raw, earthly scent, and he could hear the soft tick of her heart.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m scared,” the girl whispered.</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re scared?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Scared of what?” He could feel her whole body convulsing.</p>
<p>“About what I need to do for the cash.”</p>
<p>He looked at her sullenly. Then he glanced about the suite—its crystal, silk, gold—like David&#8217;s own palace of sin. “Nothing,” he responded. “I just wanted you to give me a hug.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m old enough to be your father. I&#8217;m not going to do anything to you. And if you want to take the money, that&#8217;s fine.”</p>
<p>She was shaking madly, half-writhing in his arms.</p>
<p>“There, there,” he said. “It&#8217;s okay.”</p>
<p>“No, it&#8217;s not okay.” She backed away. “Fuck you, you Jew.”</p>
<p>“What&#8217;s wrong?”</p>
<p>She eyed him darkly. “You forgot to inspect me,” she said. Then she reached in her vest. “Allahu Akbar.”</p>
<p>“Shit.”</p>
<p>The last thing that Shlomo Lipshitz would hear—besides the sound of shrapnel impacting his head—was the sound of the wind as it rattled the glass, and an echoing, high, shrieking laugh. Whether it was the girl&#8217;s, or Yossi&#8217;s, or even his father&#8217;s, Shlomo himself never knew.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: normal;">THE ICEMAN</span></p>
<p>Each of us has two parents, four grandparents, eight great-grandparents, 16 great-great-grandparents and so on.  If the Iceman died 5,100 years ago, and we take a generation to be 30 years, then he died 170 generations ago.  The number of ancestors of each of us would then be 2170.  Therefore our ancestral lines must have crossed repeatedly in this time . . . . This view has enough to it to make it very probably that we have before us a proper forefather.</p></blockquote>
<p><i>&#8212;</i><i>Torstein</i><i> </i><i>Sjovold</i><i>, in The Man in the Ice, 1992 Innsbruck International Symposium</i><i></i></p>
<p>Some years ago, along the Alpine ridge that traces what is now the border between the Austrian Tyrol and the Italian province of Alto Adige, a man walked with two goats he had that day trapped and hobbled.  It was late summer, and the high grasses were yielding the last of their color.  Against the grays of the mountain, the schist of boulders and glacial ice, the black eyes and hooves of the animals and the man’s ruddy skin were the only movement, the only contrast.  The maize of his clothes matched the landscape, and indeed came from it.  He wore a coat of hide, likely the red deer plentiful in those mountains; from a leather cinch about his waist hung a loincloth and leggings from the same animal.  He also wore a leather apron, and an over-sized cape of woven grasses.  Within the seams of this cape-coat he had stuck three or four clumps of tinder fungus, an inedible mushroom valuable as a fire-starter.  His upper shoe was also deerskin, but the soles were bear, the toughest hide available, cut to measure by a skilled cobbler.  He was not unarmed.</p>
<p>He traveled with everything he owned.  Hunting in the high mountains, he had slept every night on the alpine tundra. The chamois goats that he led were long-haired and their pelts would bring a premium.  He was expert in snaring and tracking, and spent most of his days in the far parts of remote country.  This excursion had been successful—he would bring the goats, alive, to the encampment of shelters that gathered six or eight miles down, where the glacier turned to a fast river the color of molten lead.  He knew the people of the camp, spoke their language.  They were not unfriendly and they would trade with him.</p>
<p>Tonight he himself would bed down on the mountain, and be among them tomorrow.  He carried enough food so that he would not have to butcher either goat.</p>
<p>He had not yet decided what to seek in exchange for his quarry.  Food he could always find.  His shoes were sturdy, and he had enough flint and arrows—no need to carry more.  He knew of a woman in the village, perhaps he would ask for her, but that would bring other needs –shelter and a place to return to— and an end to the life he had lived for most of his time.  Still, it had been a long while, and if he ever were going to have a hut and a woman and a family, now was the time.</p>
<p>The goats had been surprisingly easy to stalk.  Chamois live high in the rock.  Because they are so fleet afoot and protect each other, they pay little attention to danger.  Their sentinels always look downhill when on guard, and are unused to an enemy who approaches from above.  That of course is what he did—set his snares where the grasses were long and ungrazed, and simply waited.</p>
<p>So, he thought as he closed his loop around the shinbone of first one, then the second.  They give us several lessons: rely on your kind, but not too much.  And look over your shoulder.  In his hunts he had come to think about what it meant to be a goat or a partridge or a red deer—there was no other way to succeed.  He had decided it was not very different from being a person.</p>
<p>He considered the sun’s decline and decided to stay the night alongside the glacier, in a flat part of the ridge.  Boulders would shelter him from the wind.  If he began the climb down, night would fall and catch him in the open.</p>
<p>He carried a longbow strung with a length of deer sinew.  He had sharpened one end of the bow to a point, to increase its use.  Untying the thong, he drove the shaft into the tundra and tethered his goats to it.  He bound the rear leg of each to the other, so they wouldn’t wander. Anchored now, they were content to graze.  A chalky stream came off the glacier, through his campsite, and would serve for water.  He took a birch-bark sheet from inside his cape, and curled it into a cone.  Three times he filled it from the stream and drank it off.  He had been up with the moon to get his goats.  Now he would nap, and when he woke it would be time to make the second and last meal of the day.</p>
<p>It had been a good life, and had taken him across distant ranges of mountains.  Many summers he had herded sheep: he would gather them from local camps, pasture them in the alpine grasses, and during the good weather walk to distant enclaves that had skills other than husbandry. To the north was the tribe who had made his clothes, beyond them a source of flints and flint blades.  To the south, extraordinary craftsmen who fashioned him an ax with a bright metal blade, the red-orange of his campfire.  He’d found the color in only a few river stones, and in meadow butterflies.  His own ax had cost him three grown ewes and a ram.  That summer, other than what he’d given for the ax, his stock went to repay the villagers who had started his herd.  It was important to honor his word.  Otherwise he had no vocation, and was merely a thief.</p>
<p>The ax was a cause of satisfaction to him.  Its builder had selected the handle with great care, a northern hardwood cut from a durable joint.  The blade had been hafted into a notch and secured with what must be pitch.  Great ingenuity had gone into lodging the blade.  It had been cast with flanges, concave indents on its facets that fit between two natural bulges on the joint of wood.</p>
<p>Over the years he’d used the instrument almost as many ways as he’d used his hand.  It scraped for roots and, when he was hungry enough, insects.  It cut firewood.  The blunt end could dispatch a trapped hare and the sharp butcher it.  It was a weapon and after his fall last year a walking stick.  It also gave him, he knew, authority.  Wherever he visited, the ax was a pennant that everyone recognized.  Not merely for what it could do, but the effort and travel and civilization it signaled.  Pits in the ground had produced the metal.  He had seen them, men risking their bodies to extract and refine these veins of rock.  Further south, he was told, they were making an even more durable metal, combining the red ore with other rare earth.  But this blade had lasted him well.</p>
<p>On his journeys he’d seen remarkable sights.  To the west, a tribe had men and women skilled in drawing, and they put their pictures of mammoth and bison onto rock.  He wanted to learn about paints.  Things he knew might be of interest, how to snare, blowing an ember to flame, his thoughts on stars that chase each other like moths.</p>
<p>A recent injury still bothered him.  He had been driving a large herd to the east.  A young lamb became separated from its mother and got itself trapped on the edge of a cliff.  He worked his way out, through the milling ewes, and tried to calm the lamb, but as he neared its cries became more frantic.  Agitated by the danger, the sheep bunched up and pushed him first to the edge of the cliff and then off.  The twenty-foot drop had cracked his ribs, three from the feel of it though sometimes it felt like ten.  That was the previous summer.  Still he couldn’t breathe deeply and when he coughed he saw bright splashes of pain on the lids of his eyes.</p>
<p>Other than that his health was passable.  Wood fires had given him raw lungs, he had sharp stabbing in his spine for which a shaman had tattooed him, and his knees and hips turned on pebbles where, he knew from the many animals he had dressed out, there should be gristle.  But his teeth were sound and his sight sharp.  Winter was coming, and winters were always hard.  This would be the time to consider village living.</p>
<p>Village living.  If that was where he was going, he should plan for what he and a mate would need.  He could trade one goat for a batten blanket to cover a lean-to, the other for its poles, a water jar, a cooking pot.  Food came easily for him.  He was skilled with the longbow, made for him by a craftsman near the sea.  He had twice seen the sea, and its vastness chilled him the way the stars did every night.  Shore people thought that on death their Spirits went out with the tides and swam with the creatures.  Not he.  He was a mountain man, and mountain people knew that after death their Spirits went to the sky as new stars, and there waited.  At the next birth of a creature, whether a beetle, a badger, or a human baby, a star came down to become its Spirit.  The Spirit of every being demanded respect, since one day it might occupy the body of your friend or your child.  The worst thing you could do was to insult a being, for that cut his Spirit, and its bleeding was inside.<br />
That was a thought worth a cave wall.  But how to draw it?  He had made images on a scrap of hide old apron, using blackberry juice and an antler point.  What if others would do this?  What if ten men had thoughts worth recording?  Twenty?  A hundred?</p>
<p>He took off his cape and aligned it on the soft grasses so that when he slept, the northern winds would blow up from his feet.  Then he lay down and watched the stars.</p>
<p>In his lifetime he had spent more nights outside than, and he knew the patterns of the stars.   Watching them had brought him to the sure feeling that the stuff of the universe was an infinite number of tiny bits moving arbitrarily through space.  They were like the motes in the air one saw on swatting his cloak in the first sunlight.  No difference existed between the make-up of his body and the make-up of the sun or the oceans.  These bits collided, merged together, broke apart and reformed, he was convinced, altering their form and appearance, altering their very quality—sometimes solid as stone and other times elusive as mist, a ceaseless pattern of creation and destruction.</p>
<p>If it was so that Spirits ascended and that everything consists of the same stuffing, then we were all tied together, stones, trees, hawks, goats, men.  More than related. Interchangeable.</p>
<p>Others looked up at the same night sky and found the fabric for myth: gods and motives and schemes, stories that children loved.  But he puzzled why adults found greater dignity in these stories than in the remarkable truth to which he had come.  In his way of thinking the miraculous family of the universe was one, mountain and goat and the grass that bound the two, river and fish and man who lived off them.  He had heard of the lands where conquest drove the inhabitants, where men struggled in ambition to subjugate others and then struggled in fear to maintain their slaves in servitude, and he saw its futility.  Those men were chasing dreams, and before their death they would see that they had chased a path that missed the beauty and pleasure the world afforded.</p>
<p>Smiling at his deliberations, he closed his eyes and thought about nothing.</p>
<p>He woke with the sure knowledge that some animal force was within feet of where he lay.  The ax was by the camp fire, too far.  One hand slipped down inside his jacket to find the flint blade that had been wrapped in a rawhide handle, lest its edges cut his hands.  It was of no match against a large mammal, but a wolf or badger might be discouraged by a slice.  Once he had it in his palm, he opened his eyes.</p>
<p>Three unkempt and dirty men sat around him.  He recognized the dirtiest, a swarthy youth whose deformity had given him the name of Rabbit: his upper lip was split and shortened at its midpoint, leaving his teeth exposed in a permanent sneer.  He was from the camp on the river.  That same warp had given the lad a split hard palate and odd speech.  Everyone assumed he was dimwitted, and the lad played the part.</p>
<p>Now with a point of reference, the man recognized the other two as well, also locals.  One, perhaps Rabbit’s age, had a single eyebrow that crossed the slope of his forehead and gave him a menacing look.  The third was albino, fluttering blond eyelids and white hair, a grown though slight fellow who in his village was called Little Pink.</p>
<p>The three men waited for him to sit up, so they could determine whether he was someone they would kill.</p>
<p>The eldest, Little Pink, spoke first. He admonished the man for sleeping in the open, unguarded.  He used the language that had come up from the south.  The man knew this tongue quite well.</p>
<p>“Postin viam videmos `tranges da lontano valle.”  On the road we are seeing strangers from a remote valley.  At the verb he waved one hand backwards over a shoulder to signify he was speaking in the past.</p>
<p>The man shrugged.  “I have nothing to hide,” he said.</p>
<p>“It is not what you hide but what you have,”  Little Pink answered, and the man knew he was right.  Friends might kill you for the provisions in your rucksack.  Strangers needed no reason.  The man nodded.  He had been thinking about the very predicament before he lay down to sleep: how might humans rediscover the self-protective urges he’d observed in so many of the animals?  To kill only what you would eat, so that there would be more when you grew hungry again.  To look out for the others of your kind: the sheep who were agitated over the imperiled lamb, the two goats who quieted down immediately when bound to each other.  Even ants seemed to understand how to act for a single purpose, cutting food and storing it in their nests for lean times.</p>
<p>His musings were interrupted.</p>
<p>“Have you any food?” One Brow asked.  He looked up the hill where the two goats stood, rump to rump, chewing and blinking.</p>
<p>“You are hungry?”</p>
<p>“We’ve had nothing to eat all day.  Yesterday Little Pink stoned a skinny hare and we cooked it with some roots.  Bitter roots.  We’ve seen nothing more.  The village sent us out hunting and we can barely feed ourselves. ”</p>
<p>The man knew the deer herds were still up high—he had seen them, but decided not to harvest any because he was so far from any settlement.  They were grazing on the Alpine humus that snows would soon cover.  These men were village dwellers, not competent hunters.  They had failed because they sought animals that slept while they searched, and grazed while they slept.</p>
<p>“We will butcher one of my goats and make a feast,” the man said.  He asked Rabbit to gather firewood from the pine forests that had sprung up at the glacier’s drainage.  To One Brow he gave a birch-bark cone and told him to go with Rabbit and collect June berries from the bushes he would find on the floor of the groves.</p>
<p>The man stripped off his coat and leggings so he could more easily work.  Standing in loincloth, apron and shoes, he noticed Little Pink&#8217;s curiosity.  One by one, he untied the several buckskin pouches from his belt and laid them on a large, flat-topped boulder.  Little Pink shyly came over, and the man explained.</p>
<p>“These are arrow holders.  These arrows,” two of the heads were bound with bone and the one a finely shaved stone point with flutes, “are finished.  These others need work.”  The second sack held shafts of ash, bone and stone points, crow feathers, their barbules stripped on one side from the vein, ready to be attached as fletching. A third sack contained various tools.  A slender antler tip—the man demonstrated—it punched holes in hide to allow the binding of edges.  There was a thick roll of maple leaves gathered from a valley floor.  The extra flints Little Pink recognized.  But he did not understand another tool:  a hollow bone, the length of a hand, into which the rending bicuspid of a carnivore –a wolf or a wild dog—had been jammed.  Without words to explain, the man took out a two-inch length of flint and patiently began to demonstrate.  Pressing the tooth point forcefully into the stone, he broke off a tiny flake.  Then moved centimeters down and repeated the step.  In minutes he had given what Little Pink assumed to be a fire starter a second life—a razor-sharp, scalloped blade.</p>
<p>The next sack held grains of finely ground einkorn.  The man gave Little Pink the sack and made him to understand he was to stir it into a paste—bread for the evening’s meal.<br />
Finally the last leather pouch—a miscellany.  Bits of batten, unused buckskin patches and bark shreds, a short strip of sinew and the mandible of a small rodent, which, Little Pink realized, could be used as a saw.  He pointed to the last item and gave a questioning look.  A marble disk, perhaps a hand’s width across, had been threaded through with leather strips, knotted on one side.</p>
<p>The man nodded idly while considering an answer.  Finally he responded, first by describing with his arm the expanse above, which his pupil took to mean that he was abandoning all tense and time.  Then he used the words for creating and beast and Spirit, but for that last he used the suffix that signified the Great Spirit.</p>
<p>Little Pink listened carefully, then pursed his lips and put a hand to his new friend’s shoulder, to thank him for the lesson.  But in fact he did not believe the man.  How could this toy turn the stars?  It appeared to be simply a spool on which the man kept spare rawhide strips, and it was clear the man did not want to share any extras with him.<br />
Only when he was demonstrating the blading tool had the man let go of his remarkable ax.  Now he reclaimed it and used it as a cane to walk up to the captive goats.</p>
<p>Together they untethered the smaller goat and untied it from its mate.  The man led it to the large boulder.  He placed his hands on the animal by its withers, leaned down and whispered in its ear to apologize and to alert its Spirit.  Then, the man dispatched the goat, a crisp blow with the heel of the ax-head to its forehead, and as cleanly slit the goat’s throat.  Together they hoisted its hind legs over the rock, and set about its skinning and dressing out.</p>
<p>The two youths returned from the glade of trees.  The man chose the thinnest branches in their bundle, sliced in some mushroom as tinder, and built a pile in the shape of a lean-to.  He unrolled his stash of leaves and placed an ember from yesterday’s fire at the heart.  Flames began to crackle.  The young men gathered rocks from the surrounding scree and heated them.  The man severed all four haunches so the meat would cook more quickly.  Soon the goat carcass was roasting underneath the stones, its aroma filling the breeze, and the flat einkorn cracker was baking atop.</p>
<p>The man noticed Rabbit over by the large boulder, inspecting his tools, and went over to ask if he could explain.  But Rabbit seemed embarrassed and rushed away.  The man was sensitive to this sullenness, but laid it off to youth.  He’d found that people, boys in particular, were uncomfortable about learning.</p>
<p>His guests gobbled down the meal.  The goat was succulent, the einkorn welcome.  He had shown them how to mash the berries with leaves from wild rose and goose-foot that grew on the tundra, how the herbs took away the sourness.  The sun was now below the mountain tops and its heat was spilling quickly from the thin air.  In the faint light he noticed that Rabbit had acquired a new accoutrement: the man’s second quiver, the one with the finished arrows, hung from Rabbit’s belt.</p>
<p>“That’s a well made pouch,” the man said.</p>
<p>“Yes,” agreed Rabbit.  “It is like the one you have.”</p>
<p>“It is, indeed,” the man said.  “I can see that one edge has been patched with grass.  That patch will not hold.  I’ll give you some gut to sew it.”</p>
<p>Again, Rabbit grew agitated.  It was too dark for anyone to see a seam on the pouch.<br />
“Yes,” Rabbit murmured.  “I’ve been meaning to do that.”</p>
<p>Rabbit’s companions watched the ground during this exchange.  The fire burned lower and the man raked through its ashes and salvaged two thumb-sized lengths of charred branch to wrap in his leaves.  Then, leaning on his ax, he limped over to the grass mat that served as both bed and shawl and lay down.</p>
<p>Silently the guests fell to sleep.  But the man was restless and in pain.  His side hurt, his hard day of tracking and climbing had left every joint throbbing, and he knew something was wrong with his insides.  He had seen whipworm in the entrails of animals he had butchered, and suspected he had one himself.  A Spirit may inhabit a body, but it must sometimes share the space.</p>
<p>It was a good thing to have shared the goat with guests.  He had no need for trade, he was too sickly to start thinking of a family.  Instead, this day he had made three friends from a village, and passed on a bit about skinning and preparing berries.  One of them, Rabbit, was worth a picture.  Without correction, Rabbit’s spirit would sour and grow sullen, and he’d make cruelty in the world.</p>
<p>A million million stars came out, and gathered across the sky into their banded community.  He found the four or five brightest—Spirits, he knew, now spiraling to earth to occupy their next creation.  From under his greatcoat he took the marble disk and, as he did most nights, began tracing the turns of the bright stars by weaving loops.  He had first thought that the Spirits of the sky were distant and static, and the wheel they described every night was like the smoke from a fire.  They simply went up and came down in a helix.</p>
<p>But after charting their epicycles for many nights with his astronomical invention, he knew better.  Disembodied Spirits behaved in the sky just as we did below.  Some went in tandem with each other, some intersected and drifted off, others like him lived a life on the outside, describing their own orbit.  Still he had traveled widely, had spun about settlements, tended herds, slept alone and occasionally twinned.  And so, he came to understand, bodies were not important.  They were like the antennae of beetles, they receive signals, they translate pleasure and pain, but they are not what link us to the heavens.</p>
<p>Eventually the man slept.  When he awoke he realized from the brightness that he was well into the day.  Little Pink sat cross-legged nearby, watching him.</p>
<p>“I need to rise, to water the goat.”</p>
<p>“I do that while you sleep,” Little Pink said, indicating the past.  The man nodded his thanks, rose and began to shake out his cape.</p>
<p>“Why are you letting Rabbit take your pouch?” Little Pink asked.</p>
<p>The man explained.  When they first asked for food it was because they were in need.  When Rabbit took the quiver, perhaps it was because he, the man, had two, and Rabbit had none.  Perhaps Rabbit had a child or a sister who had been snatched by robbers and he needed something to barter in ransom.  Or he needed arrows to find food for his family.</p>
<p>“If he couldn’t tell me, it was because he would embarrass himself and wound his Spirit.”</p>
<p>“What if he just wanted it?  What if he wants to have things just to have them?”</p>
<p>“Then he has a sickness,” the man said, “and that too would embarrass him and wound his Spirit.”</p>
<p>“I can get it back for you,” Little Pink offered.</p>
<p>The man smiled and shook his head.  “From the moment Rabbit appeared at the fire wearing the pouch, I put it out of my mind.  Now it belongs to him.”</p>
<p>Here is a man, thought Little Pink, who is close to the stars.</p>
<p>Just then five men appeared over the ridge.  The suddenness with which they arrived meant they had approached in stealth.  Three carried thick cudgels and one a long bow although no arrow had been notched in the string.</p>
<p>The man realized his ax was in hand but his flint knife and bow were on the rock, out of reach.  The visitors were from a far valley.  They had yellow hair and blue eyes.  He had stayed once with such a tribe, to the north, and knew a little of their tongue, an old European dialect not used in this valley.  The man welcomed them in all the languages he knew, and pointed to the ground to say, &#8220;Sit with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their leader was disfigured&#8211;the skin on one side of his face scarred to look like the scales of a snake.  He wore a bearskin cap and a primitive pelt that tied about his middle.  The man knew they were scanning the rock where his possessions lay, exposed, estimating the villagers’ armament, measuring the weight of the remaining goat.</p>
<p>“Stay a while,” the man said.  “We have meat and biscuits to share.”  One Brow fetched the leftovers and the three villagers sat in a semi-circle.  Slowly the man with the snakeskin face sat as well.  The goat carcass went around and each man tore off handfuls of meat.  Throughout, the man stood leaning on the head of his formidable ax.</p>
<p>“You have been hunting?” the man asked, mostly by pantomime.  He learned from their answer they were seeking the herds of red deer.</p>
<p>The man told them that he had seen large herds in the high country.  Also packs of wolves that fed on them.  He pointed out the way, drew the mountains in the dirt, and with circles for suns counted the three days’ walk.  When they finished eating he handed them the remains of the goat.</p>
<p>Before they left, the snakeskin man produced an amulet, a clouded garnet the size of a walnut.  He showed it to the man, then knelt and rubbed the stone on the man’s crippled knees.</p>
<p>The man took the stone and placed his hand on the donor’s shoulder.  The five men trudged off in search of game.</p>
<p>“I have another question,” Little Pink said as they packed up.  “You share food with us because we’re from your tribe.  I understand that.  You visit us and trade in our village.  But why do you share food with them?”</p>
<p>The man shrugged.  “We have another goat.  They had none.  They came thinking they might take everything from us, and they left as friends.  What is a good trade for the scraps of meat they ate?   Some cloth and a pot for cooking, or five friends?”</p>
<p>All of this Little Pink attended with solemnity.  The man donned the rest of his clothing, tied in his pouches, and said his goodbyes.  Before starting on his hike down the hill, he needed to relieve himself.  The great glacier was only steps away, and the man believed in privacy and modesty.</p>
<p>He climbed onto the glacier, and, ax in hand, stepped forward.  The glacier, he knew was a marvelous sieve.  It purified the waters that all animals, including he, spilled on it.  On top the surface was striped with deep abysses, and its snows had melted and refrozen again a thousand days.  The crevasses were not monochrome but grays and browns and various shades of ivory—nut-grown and wax and cream—all whorled like the bandings of marble.  The man smiled, because the designs echoed the complexities of the world he’d observed.<br />
Below he saw Little Pink talking earnestly to Rabbit.  Little Pink held what had been the man’s quiver.  Good, thought the man.  He is explaining my thoughts.  So my few words go first to Little Pink and then to Rabbit and, then, who knows where?  We do the work of the glacier.  It scatters rock and seed and plants throughout the valley, and it breeds rivers that will water life so far away we cannot imagine.  Who can say what this glacier will bring down to people that are not yet here, whose stars seem frozen in the highest sky?  Before the men left, he told himself, he would salve Rabbit’s spirit.  After all, it was only a hide pouch and some trinkets.  He turned his back to the conversation and began to pee.<br />
In fact Little Pink was scolding Rabbit.  Whatever he was saying made Rabbit flush with shame and anger.  The older man finished, called to One Brow, and they moved off, expecting that the chastened Rabbit would follow.</p>
<p>But the words had wounded Rabbit’s Spirit.  Glum and humiliated, he went to where the man’s long bow still tethered the remaining goat.  He pulled the bow from the ground.  Unaware of his new freedom, the goat continued to graze.</p>
<p>Rabbit pulled an arrow from the pouch he had been told to return.  He chose the one with the stone point.  Bone was used for distance and speed, it shot further and could bring down small game.  For stone, the bowman needed to be close to his target.</p>
<p>He nocked the arrow into the string, and loaded the bow with his weight.  It was a simple matter to take aim and let fly.</p>
<p>The arrow entered the man’s back at his shoulder blade.  Its edges, each bearing the tiny c’s of chipped flint like the mark of a child’s fingernail, cut and severed the man’s left axillary artery.</p>
<p>Now Rabbit climbed up onto the glacier.  The ax was still in the man’s hand, the man himself still breathing but life leaking out from him.  It would be a simple matter to wrest it from the man, but Rabbit knew he could not take the ax.  Any tools, for that matter.  They would give him away.  Little Pink, who had befriended this man, would be angry.  Fit and strong, Rabbit had pulled the bowstring back its full measure, had loosed the arrow with force.  Its head had come out the other side, by the man’s shoulder, underneath the collarbone.  Rabbit grabbed the shaped stone and with considerable effort pulled the shaft through.  Then he put his foot under the man, at the stomach, and rolled him into the crevasse.</p>
<p>The ax lay on the edge of the trench.  Rabbit kicked it after the body.  He stared in thought at the longbow and arrow, and reluctantly threw them in.  The stolen quiver as well.  Then, his Spirit lifted, he turned and hurried down the mountainside to join his fellows.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 1825, two discarded cadavers at the London Royal Academy of Anatomy began to glow. The bodies had once been inhabited by two thieves, ill with pneumonia, who had died in the gaol while awaiting trial.  When no family members appeared to claim their kin, the bodies were delivered to science. The papers that identified the cadavers listed the ages of the two men as 52 and 24—although by the time their necrotized flesh began to glow, their ages would have been quite difficult to determine. The bodies had already been to the operating theatre and been run through the gamut of dissection, from the pulmonary system to the lenses of the eye. What remained after the clumsy poking and prodding lay wrapped in burlap in the dark of a stone basement, awaiting burial. The young medical student assigned to direct the disposal had dallied in arranging for burial in the paupers’ square, a delay that had left the bodies decaying in the dark for an extra day. By the evening he arrived with the gravedigger, the air in the basement had grown foul and the flesh had begun to seep moisture through the burlap covering the bodies. There was no missing that glow.  The seeping fluids stained a faint shining outline of the bodies through the burlap.  In the time it took the medical student to locate his superior, Dr. Browning, and for Dr. Browning to locate his superior, Dr. Ebbins, the glow had only intensified.</p>
<p>The doctors convened a hasty experiment in which they made an interesting discovery. By scraping at the glowing necrotized flesh, and applying it to the dead flesh of a fresh cadaver, the glow could be induced to spread, an eerie light that shone in the dark, chemical-doused air of the operating theatre. After thirty hours, the glow petered out in the bodies of the two thieves, the stench of their putrefying by then nearly unbearable, but the glow persisted in the more recently dead flesh of a third and fourth cadaver—both donated by a West London mental hospital.  The glow might have been spread to a fifth and possibly sixth cadaver, had Dr. Browning not, in an effort to stave off decay, doused the cadavers in alcohol, which had the effect of extinguishing permanently any sign of the eerie bluish light.</p>
<p>*  *  *</p>
<p>In 1667, Robert Boyle, after arriving home late one night, had just sat down to a dinner consisting of a neck of veal purchased the Tuesday before and boiled greens from his back garden, when a gust of wind blew out his lamp. Looking down, he discovered that parts of his veal were still quite visible, illuminated by their own light. An unlearned man might have discarded such a meal and an especially hungry man have eaten it, but Robert Boyle was neither. Although Boyle had achieved fame as director of the East India Company, translator of the Bible into Irish, and author of “The Sceptical Chymist,”—which in later years would prove to be a founding text of modern chemistry—he nonetheless prided himself as an alchemist above all else. Thus, he took his plate directly to the laboratory, where he discovered that, unlike common fire, the light from his veal could not be extinguished by his stepping on it. Nor did subsequent experiments show the light from his veal to be anything like the light produced from a piece of burning coal.</p>
<p>Boyle published his findings on his veal dinner in one of his less famous works, <em>Observations upon an Artificial Substance that Shines without any Preceding Illustration</em>, in which he wrote, “Tho’ a quick coal be actually and vehemently hot; I have not observed luminous flesh to be so much as sensibly lukewarm. A live coal, being pressed betwixt two planes of glass will not continue to burn for very many minutes, but a piece of shining flesh will shine for some days, moreover, whereas a live coal as it burns fends forth store of smoak or exhalations, luminous flesh does not.” Only by introducing the luminous flesh to a prolonged vacuum could Boyle manage to extinguish the light, at which point in the text, Boyle’s observations move on to the subject of glow-worms.</p>
<p>*  *  *</p>
<p>In 1847, Hans Christian Anderson, the Danish poet known for his children’s stories, wrote a short story in which an anthropomorphized street lamp, having run low on wick and oil, auditions replacements for a new light source. The hopefuls include a star, a glow-worm, and the severed head of a herring.  No mention is made as to how the severed herring head will produce sufficient light to illuminate the street-lamp; the herring head’s luminous capacity is simply assumed by the narrator to be as self-evident as that of the glow-worm and the star.</p>
<p>Anderson was born in Odense, on the Kattegat, a narrow strait that connects the Baltic to the North Sea, and where, every spring, millions of herring rose from the depth of the North Sea to spawn, until the sea seemed thicker with fish than water. Each female herring could annually lay more than seventy thousand eggs, and the fisherman of Odense believed that if even a fraction of the spawn were to survive the haddock, cod, dogfish, suckerfish and their own nets to subsequently grow to size, the herring would shortly displace all the water in the North Sea. As it was, vast shoals of herring, trapped in the Kattegat by aberrant winds, could cover a coastline with a crust of fish two feet thick. The Danes of Odense went out with baskets, collecting what they could, but the majority of fish flesh rotted, and the stench tainted many of Anderson’s childhood summers.</p>
<p>Not including the shoals of herring that beached themselves, in each year of Anderson’s childhood, men pulled an estimated sixty billion herring from the North Sea. The herring swam in giant wedge-shaped shoals, and the fisherman of Anderson’s day tracked them at sundown, when a pulsating glow could be seen on the water, a glow which Odense tradition held to be the reflection of the setting sun on millions of teeming fish, although more scientifically minded fishermen argued that the reflection could just have easily come from the sheen of floating silver scales, numbering in the hundreds of millions, shed by the herring as they surged up from the Northern depths. In any case, once a shoal had been located, the fisherman of Odense unspooled long nets into the shoals, setting them in an S pattern, so as to create to double concave spaces, netting the fish no matter which direction the shoal swam. Rather than close the nets, the mass of herring pressed against the nets and caught their fins and gills on the thin black silk, and, after a period of two to three hours, thrashed themselves to death. At daybreak, the fishermen simply rolled up the nets, hung so thickly with herring that they resembled carpets.</p>
<p>The fisheries of Odense barely kept up with the volume of herring deposited each morning. The fish had to be gutted, salted, and placed in barrels at a fantastic speed, for in the nineteenth century, the herring underwent a strange change upon their death. After all the thrashing, rushing blood colored the gills a crimson red and the skin a striking blue—if the fish were not salted and packed at this point, it began to glow, a strange phosphorescent light, and it was from this light that a discerning customer could know that the fish had begun to decay. In the fields beyond the Odense fisheries, massive piles of discarded herring heads and guts shone in the evening dark, a sight familiar to Anderson and the children who read his stories. A short number of decades later, as a consequence of overfishing, the Kattegat Strait would be declared the world’s first marine dead zone, devoid of herring, and thus, of the strange glow that Anderson imagined might have been chosen to illuminate a charming Copenhagen streetlight.</p>
<p>*  *  *</p>
<p>In 1840, a twelve-year old boarding student at Saint Donetien Collage sneaked away onto <em>The</em> <em>Coralie</em>, a three-masted ship bound for India. The night before the ship was to embark, the ship’s bos’n spotted the boy, Jules Verne, peering out from under a lifeboat. In the morning, the bos’n put the boy ashore, where his waiting father immediately delivered a sound whipping. Jules responded to this whipping by resolving to henceforth travel primarily in his imagination.</p>
<p>Twenty-nine years later, one of the explorers of his imagination finally made the journey to India. When his ship, <em>The Nautilus</em>, entered the Bay of Bengal, he encountered hundreds of corpses, bobbing on the waves that crashed against the hull of his ship. “They were the dead of the Indian villages, carried by the Ganges to the level of the sea, and which the vultures, the undertakers of the country, had not been able to devour.”</p>
<p>Passing through the bay of corpses, night fell, and <em>The Nautilus</em> was immersed in what appeared to be a sea of milk. “At first sight the ocean seemed lactified. The whole sky, though lit by sidereal waves, seemed black by comparison with the luminescent whiteness of the waters.”</p>
<p>Verne, ever the scientist—or science fictionist—was quick to invent an answer to this mystery: “It is called a milk sea. The whiteness which surprises you is caused only by the presence of myriads of infusoria, a sort of luminous little worm, gelatinous and without color, of the thickness of a hair and whose length is not longer than seven-thousandths of an inch. These insects adhere to one another, sometimes for several leagues. If I am not mistaken, ships have floated on these milk seas for more than forty miles.”</p>
<p>The milk sea thus explained, the Nautilus sailed on, leaving behind it a “sky that reflected the whitened waves, and for a long time seemed impregnated with the vague glimmerings of an aurora borealis.”</p>
<p>After Verne published his imagined travels upon a milk sea in Chapter 24 of his 1869 Novel, <em>Vignt Mille Lieues Sous les Mers</em>, translated into English four years later as <em>Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea</em>, he began to receive, on a fairly regular basis, letters from sailors, inquiring about his account of the milk sea, or quibbling with his description. The letters from the sailors kept up for twenty years or so. The light of the milk sea, they wrote, was bluish, not white. And they encountered it more often in the lonely stretches of the North Sea, not India. And there were no worms, certainly there were no worms—wherever did he get the idea that it was worms? What he had gotten right, the sailors wrote, were the corpses. Even if the corpses weren’t visible, from the bright opaque waters of the Milk Sea rose the stench of decay, the smell of death. One Welsh sailor, who’d been a harpooner on a whaler out of Nantucket, wrote to Verne to inquire whether Verne had personally encountered a milk sea, and if so, for Verne to take care. Those who sail a milk sea encounter tragedy soon after. The death marks them, clings to them, and sooner or later, takes its inevitable toll.</p>
<p>Shortly after having received this letter, Jules Verne arrived home one spring night to find his young nephew, Gaston, who suffered from symptoms of delusion and paranoia, standing at the wrought-iron gate that opened to Verne’s garden. Verne gave Gaston a friendly wave. In return, Gaston produced a pistol from inside his jacket, aimed it at Verne, and fired twice.</p>
<p>*  *  *</p>
<p>Just after the battle of Ypres, <em>The Times </em>of London hired Ernest Daub, an American raised in Holland, as correspondent to cover the conditions in the scorched “dead zones” of Belgium, between the German and English entrenchments. Although he had been hired on the strength of his Dutch, he had exaggerated the depth of his experience as a reporter. Intimidated by the brusque, hardened manner of the English reporters, Daub avoided any sign of wires, afraid of encountering one of the three other Times reporters, who would certainly inquire what he had wired to London, when, in fact, he had yet to have wired anything. Consequently, he spent a good deal of his time at the field hospital attempting to interview wounded soldiers, who, being confined to beds and suffering equally of pain and boredom, did not scorn him when his lines of questioning revealed him to be hopelessly green.</p>
<p>He had a gentle manner, and perhaps his constant presence caused the soldiers to confuse him with a chaplain or nurse, for in a tent housing primarily soldiers from Driffield, the bedridden men began to describe for him the horrible nights of their last battle. Their regiment had been ordered to move forward into the no-man’s land under the cover of dark, but the Germans had sent up flares and directed artillery fire and gas into the dead zones. The men fell back, ducking into the miasma of the trenches, but left a third of their regiment dead or dying within eyesight. Hearing the pleas of their wounded comrades, they launched tin canteens out into the dead zones, hoping that the water could sustain them until the fighting lessened, but the shouts and screams grew ever feebler. In the gray light of morning, they saw three men, as close as fifty yards to the trench. A quick-footed, red-haired boy from Hull scampered out in hopes that he might find one or two alive, but as he leaned over the nearest man, a sniper bullet caught him beneath the ear, so that he dropped into a motionless embrace with the dead man. The two corpses lay cheek to cheek, as if whispering secrets to each other. The next night, a strange light shone from around the bodies, illuminating pockets of drifting mist and mustard gas. Their dark-haired lieutenant, a Southerner from Brighton, declared the light was an effect of the gas, which reacted with the flesh of the bodies—but the men familiar with the bogs of Northern England knew better: corpse candles.</p>
<p>Daub happened to remember mentions of corpse candles from his reading of the <em>Denham Tract</em>s, records of English folklore collected the previous century. Embers of Hell granted by the Devil to guide the lost dead through a twilight world, or perhaps, floating to illuminate a path for the soon-to-be dead. Both the Welsh and Irish reported that the corpse candles always preceded the death of those who saw it, or of a loved one—one could even determine the coming death by the color of the light, reddish for men, pale blue for women, or yellowish for children. The lights bobbed and flickered, almost intelligently; if a lost traveler followed them, they would lead him deep into the dark and vanish, whereupon the traveler would find himself sinking in a bog, or standing at the edge of a precipice.<br />
Having loved ghost stories since his childhood, Daub wrote up the story of the Driffield soldiers, mentioning that nearly a dozen men had claimed to see the light, and adding his own literary touch by mentioning the ghost stories of the French writer Prosper Merimee, who had also described above a corpse a blue flame which disappeared upon the approach of an observer. Daub, quite proud of his report, wired it to London, whereupon it was rejected as fanciful, in poor taste, and a detriment to troop morale. His stint as a <em>Times</em> correspondent ended one month later, and he was not asked to continue. Upon his return to London, he published the story in <em>The Stem</em>, a literary journal that folded two years afterward, after which the journal’s reputation increased significantly.</p>
<p>Nearly a decade later, Daub received a letter from an man named Henry Wasties, an esteemed doctor of biology who had made his name working with cholera bacteria and who had happened upon Daub’s story.  “The glow,” wrote the doctor, “likely emanated from a colony of <em>vibrio fisheri</em>, a relative of the cholera bacteria that produces a luminescent protein at the end of its life cycle.  And although <em>v. fisheri</em> makes its natural habitat among the algae floes upon the far reaches of the oceans, it can thrive in any putrefying and decaying matter—both plant and animal—which is why such glows are often associated with harbingers of death.”</p>
<p>The doctor’s suggestion, Daub decided, was a plausible explanation—more rational than any other he had heard. Yet, by that point, a failed marriage and the horrors of the war had led him to a conservative order of Catholicism; the thought that there could be no purpose or plan for the striking imposition of light into decay left him hollow and unsatisfied. How could one find any trace of order or grace in the vagaries of bacteria?  Much more consoling, much more humane, Daub felt, was the final line from his own story, in which he had quoted directly from the son of a Driffield butcher recuperating at the field hospital, where his leg had been amputated below the knee. The boy had shut his eyes to recall the dead zones of the battle and shuddered when, from his white-sheeted bed, he gripped Daub’s hand to insist, “It was their souls out there, by God. The light of their souls.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My mother had a dream about her father, Federico Schiaretta, immolated in the suspect fire, well before my birth, that destroyed his Station Street cobbler’s shop. It was custom, almost liturgical, among Italians in East Liberty to summon a bookie and play a number, often a birth date, some scrap commemorating the beloved, any time they dreamt of a deceased relative.</p>
<p>My father, Travis Sweeney, was not at all a connected guy. In fact, he remained deliberately disconnected all his life. But, like my mother, he grew up in East Liberty, and knew plenty of mugs who took action – he knew everyone and about everyone – so it was to him that my mother, Rita Schiaretta, appealed the morning after the dream when she showed up at Fox’s Grille where he tended bar.</p>
<p>She worked next door to the bar as a receptionist in a dentist’s office, a square one story white block pillbox, with a golden name arced across the lone rectangular window facing Highland Avenue: Sheldon Roth, Dentist. Shelly Roth: a slick Jewish guy, educated and allusive, generous, chrismed and dandy, unapologetically friendly-effeminate. On the job, he wore a white tunic, but with panache. It buttoned up the side and fastened high on his neck. Like he was a baron or shaman or an ambassador from another planet. The neighborhood leagued him with the rackets. Some said he was dangerous. My father said the only thing dangerous about Shelly was his mind.</p>
<p>My mother was twenty-three, a graduate of Peabody High School, the dancer Gene Kelly’s alma mater, where she had been a swimmer and student of promise, a young woman of wit and resource, certain to make her mark. Yet she had never made it out of the neighborhood. There were things about herself she’d never know; and, on that day, December 23, 1956, ten o’clock in the morning, when she stormed into Fox’s expressly to request Travis Sweeney, a few years older than she, play a number based on a dream a mere six hours old, she would never have said that she had been cheated in the womb or that her attachment to vendetta was pathological. She did not realize these things about herself, nor would she ever, though all her life they would at every turn devil her and those she loved.</p>
<p>That day, my mother was neither bitter nor filled with inexplicable fury. It was before she started dying her hair, when her smile still had promise, and the things that would by and by become monstrous in her were innocent, sweet, even beautiful. When she was still committed to happiness rather than misery. Before her longing gouged a ditch through her heart.</p>
<p>She wore a plaid jumper and a red car coat, red gloves with red balls and furze at the fringe, red scarf, and red tam – as if she had dressed in the blood of the Yule to more passionately importune Travis Sweeney. Her eyes were brown and soft, a kindness imbedded in them. Her hands as well were soft. They would stay that way all her life, even as the rest of her hardened.</p>
<p>At the bar perched a string of played-out drummers in low-brim fedoras nursing shots and beers, stubbled gray faces twisted around filterless butts. They glanced up at her when she walked in. They knew her and her brothers. They knew her mother and how her father had died. She smiled fearlessly at them.</p>
<p>Fox’s was dark as a church. Mysterious spangles of light, through which dust nebula and reams of smoke wafted, hung like tinsel. The TV was on. The Secret Storm: the stunted lust of the monochromatic mid-fifties. Christmas music: “Santa Baby,” whined torchily by Eartha Kit. Bing’s “White Christmas.” The Andrews Sisters: “All I Want for Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth.” Next to the jukebox slouched a dwarfed artificial tree with a dozen pink bulbs and ropes of orange blinking lights that strafed the twinkling fifths queued behind the bar. A few sprung booths where people ate macaroni and ham and pickled eggs under a canopy of smoke. Neon beer signs: Straub, Duquesne, Iron City. A grease-splashed framed autographed glossy of Pirates slugger Ralph Kiner knitted at the corners with desiccated Easter palm.</p>
<p>Fox’s was the last flicker of my parents’ childhood, the omniscient threshold of their futures. The final syllables of the prologue they’d been languishing in.</p>
<p>“Travis,” my mother said, her voice mixing with the smoke</p>
<p>“Hello, Rita.”</p>
<p>“Will you do me a favor?”</p>
<p>“Anything.”</p>
<p>“A cigarette.”</p>
<p>My father smiled, slipped the scarlet package of Winstons out of his breast pocket, waved his hand over it like a magician, and proffered the pack with two cigarettes staggered out of its mouth like a TV ad. He wore a white shirt, and pleated grey trousers. He possessed the cobalt blue eyes of a Siamese cat, a full head of furious black hair and a passionately pacific temperament. He liked to hang out on the Hill and listen to jazz at the Crawford Grill.</p>
<p>My mother chose the taller of the two. My father flicked open a silver Zippo, and spun the flywheel over flint. My mother, the beautiful white cigarette between her bloody red lipsticked lips, leaned into the blue flame and took a puff.</p>
<p>“I want you to play a number for me.” She smiled. “Please?”</p>
<p>“I thought the cigarette was the favor.”</p>
<p>“It is, but not the one I came in here for. Can you play a number for me?”</p>
<p>“That’s illegal, Rita.”</p>
<p>“I won’t tell anyone.”</p>
<p>“I’d do almost anything for you, Rita.”</p>
<p>“What wouldn’t you do for me?”</p>
<p>“What I wouldn’t do is ever tell you no.”</p>
<p>“Then you’ll do it?”</p>
<p>“What’s the number?”</p>
<p>She had been awakened in the middle of the night by the unmistakable sound of her father’s soft, almost womanly, voice, though he had been a man of singular hardness. Calling her name. Not Rita, but her christened name: Carita. Which means beloved, a derivative as well of the Latinate for charity: caritas.  A dream, but not really a dream.  A vision.</p>
<p>“You think I’m kidding?” my mother asked when my dad smiled bemusedly at her – and saw that flash, that slight declension, the rev behind her brown eyes that he would grow so acquainted with in the years to come. He was falling for her, yet he knew that she spelled trouble. He was a scholar of trouble. Loving Rita Sweeney would be his tragic flaw.</p>
<p>“No, I’m listening,” he said. “A vision.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Don’t make fun of me, Travis.”</p>
<p>“I’m not.”</p>
<p>“I’ll walk out of here.”</p>
<p>“Please, Rita, continue. I’m not making fun.”</p>
<p>At the sound of her name from her father’s seared mouth, she had bolted upright in her single bed on Omega Street – the house she grew up in. She was surrounded by flames, as if the room itself was on fire – though no heat. In fact, the room had turned inexplicably cold. The white porcelain doorknob turned until released, and there in its naked jamb, wearing a suit of smoke, stood my dead cobbler grandfather. My namesake. He walked, lock-jawed, hands hidden at his back, to her bedside. Behind him burlesqued an entourage of smoldering souls, the convicts of Purgatory, writhing in a hurdy-gurdy of agony.</p>
<p>Smoke leaked from my grandfather’s closed mouth, from his nostrils, his ears. When he removed his grey fedora, a tiny bow on one side of its maroon band, plumes of it flared up toward the ceiling.  He looked down on his daughter, Carita, frozen to her little bed, its headboard draped with the rosaries her mother insisted upon, then above it the crucifix. The entire room a reliquary of statues and icons, her dresser and nightstand baroque altars of idolatry. A sickbox on one wall, a holy water font affixed to another.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t move,” she told my father.</p>
<p>My grandfather had held out his hat. In it flared a nest of glowing red coals. He stirred them with a bare hand. His gray face grinded open.</p>
<p>“I have no memory of my father speaking to me. My whole life, I can’t remember a word passed between us. And finally he’s speaking to me. I tried to rise to the sound of his voice, but I couldn’t move, and I couldn’t figure out what he was saying. Something in Italian. I just couldn’t make it out.”</p>
<p>Then Ouma, my exotically beautiful gypsy grandmother, given to wearing her dead husband’s clothing – who traipsed between the worlds of the living and the dead, who guarded the threshold of the living against the dead – burst into the room. My mother could not be sure if Ouma was of the dream or if, indeed, she had actually been there in the flesh. Smoke lifted off Federico in white shrouds, like holy vapors from the thurible. But instead of frankincense came the stench of charred leather.</p>
<p>Ouma threw up the sash of the bedroom window. The frigid night stormed in. My grandfather turned his back and walked out of the room. The poor souls of Purgatory followed him. My mother was sure she saw the Blessed Mother hovering above the flames they walked through. The blue mantle, the serpent curled about her ankle, the smile. The pact between her and her child, Rita Schiaretta.</p>
<p>“He was about to speak, Travis, to finally say something to me. Something that really mattered. I just know it. And then she opened that goddam window. I wanted to kill her, whether she was there or not.” She took drag off the cigarette as my father stared at her. “I want you to play 311. March 11. His birthday; and his shop – the shop he died in – was 311 Station Street. Okay?”</p>
<p>My father obliged her with a wry smile that would become his signature for dealing with Rita Schiaretta. He didn’t believe in those kinds of dreams or the prognostications Italians gave themselves over to in caprice or terror and sentiment. Emozione. He did not give credence to the numinous or fantastic. He did not believe in God. Though he understood better than anyone I’ve known that the mystical is often the tide of random, the inexorable erasure of history.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he’d been mesmerized by Rita Schiaretta’s wild tale – the mere fact that she had confided it to him. That she looked deeply into his eyes and clutched his forearm. He could tell that she was close to breaking down – that she was always close to breaking down – but she wouldn’t have given him or those sons of bitches drooling at the bar the satisfaction of seeing what was inside her. She’d walk out on Highland Avenue and fight any one of them. She’d rather take her place at the stake in Purgatory than let anyone see her shed a tear. He lit another cigarette and placed it in her mouth.</p>
<p>It was 1956 – a couple months after Don Larsen threw his miraculous World Series no-hitter against the Brooklyn Dodgers. A little more than a year since Allen Ginsberg had read “Howl” on Fillmore Street at the Six Gallery, something my dad knew all about it, but had no one to talk it over with. McCarthy was ransacking America, galvanizing in young men like my father dreams of riding a motorcycle to California – though he knew he never would. He didn’t even drive a car.</p>
<p>Smart as he was, and politically astute – he scoured daily the entire newspaper, had read books and studied history – despite a practical streak of Black Irish blood, he had no ambition. By the time he and my mother struck their bargain, he was an agent of ennui and even knew the word; though, like so many words he reckoned the meaning of, not merely their definitions, he never uttered it. Nor did my mother possess a speck of ambition. It had all dwindled, then disappeared. But she had backbone, something she would accuse my father all their lives together of not possessing.</p>
<p>My father was already in love with Rita Schiaretta, though she’d swear for the rest of her life that she’d never thought twice about him until that day: two days before Christmas in the brutal Pittsburgh winter of 1956. My mother had already made her break with Ouma. By all accounts she took her father Federico’s death badly, though she despised him. Whatever might have really happened between my mother and grandmother, a woman I rarely saw, like all the stories moiling together in East Liberty, became irrelevant. A spate of nonspeaking became a lifetime of vendetta.</p>
<p>So: it was my mother who took her dream to Travis Sweeney, and Travis Sweeney who walked out Fox’s front door and hatched the deal with Philly Decker,  a bookie who loafed outside the bar, and played the fin my mother had handed him on my dead grandfather’s birth date. And it came to pass, as foretold in lore, that the number hit on Christmas Eve for four hundred bucks, a small fortune, and my mother somehow convinced my father to trek with her to the Jersey shore for Christmas. Tales of similar magic are not uncommon in East Liberty.</p>
<p>My father hadn’t wanted to go to New Jersey, but by this time he had his eye on my mother. Initially, he wouldn’t have said a word in response to her suggestion that they drive to the ocean in late December. The method he would come to adopt in coping with my mother was to humor her. He shot her a politely impassive look, as though he had his fingers crossed behind him. “Okay, Rita,” he said pleasantly, not a trace of incredulity in his tone.</p>
<p>They left December 24, 1956 after their shifts had ended. Shelly Roth insisted they take his ‘53 black Cadillac de Ville. He sure wasn’t going anywhere for Christmas. As a little surprise, a bit of Christmas cheer, he stashed a fifth of Four Roses on the front seat.</p>
<p>In that same red coat, gloves, scarf, the tam, my mother slid behind the wheel. My father, who would never learn to drive, something my mother never forgave him for, rode shotgun. He had a flashlight and a map. He illustrated for my mother the sagging crimson thread, the Pennsylvania Turnpike, that traversed the bottom of Pennsylvania, from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia. Pennsylvania was a near perfect rectangle, except for its jagged eastern border where it penetrated New York and New Jersey. On the map, it was no larger than an open book of matches. The Atlantic Ocean, aqua blue at the map’s edge, was mere inches from Pittsburgh, printed in big black capital letters. My mother had never seen the ocean – she had never been outside of Pittsburgh – and, because she could not bring herself to admit this to my father, acted as if she knew exactly where they were going. My father, who had not only seen the Atlantic, but the Pacific as well, sensed this about my mother, but it didn’t matter – neither that she had never seen the ocean nor that she pretended she had. My mother was dangerous, my dad knew, bad news; but he couldn’t turn away from her – as much fault his as hers.</p>
<p>He assured her that as her navigator he’d keep his eye on that red line on the map, that it would get shorter and shorter, as they traveled in the Caddy toward that immense pool of blue; and when the road was a nub, no more than a period at the end of a story, they’d smell the Atlantic. Then what could be better? She should check in with him every now and then along the way to see how close they were, to see if they were there yet.</p>
<p>No one had ever talked to my mother like this. That kind of hushed, unhurried inflection, the patience, that smooth, almost poetic, way of putting things. She was a bit undone that my father’s gentleness softened her resolve to tell all the world to go to hell. Yet she wasn’t able to simply dismiss what he had to say as bullshit. Nor did she want to. Had there been anyone else around, she would have told my father off, told him to kiss her ass. But the two of them alone: what would it hurt for him to say such unimaginable things to her?</p>
<p>A minute later, she asked, “Are we there yet, Travis?”</p>
<p>My father’s finger, still on the line, moved slowly, as if of its own accord, like the cursor on a Ouija Board, as the de Ville rolled down Highland Avenue, through the heart of East Liberty, beneath the flashing Christmas bell garlands, on its way to the end of the earth.</p>
<p>My father laughed. She turned to him and smirked, an unlit Chesterfield in her mouth. He grabbed the cigarette and lit it, took a drag, then placed it back between her lips. Then he busted the seal on the Four Roses.</p>
<p>At this point there’s a gap in the story. They easily could’ve hit bad weather and had to detour south, or they seized on a lark: Florida. Florida in 1956. Travis and Rita, 23 and 27, laughing, falling in love in Shelly’s Caddy drinking his Four Roses, the bookmaker’s four C-notes in Rita’s purse, the snow repeating itself white in ceaseless shreds. Florida: because the ocean there, the same Atlantic that lapped against New Jersey, was warm as bathwater. Amethyst blue. The sand was white. My father, in his vagabond days, had bathed in that warm blue water. Or they got lost. Or drunk.</p>
<p>They ended up in West Virginia – diffident and landlocked, shelved under Pennsylvania – crawling down a deserted dark winding road through a blizzard along the frozen Elk River. Florida’s tepid turquoise water was in another kingdom entirely.</p>
<p>“Are we there yet?” Rita asked.</p>
<p>“Not quite,” answered my father. “But we’re close. See that river.” He pointed over at the ice-locked hoary Elk. “It runs into the ocean.”</p>
<p>The snow dropped a white curtain over the Caddy. Blinded, it slid about the road. Massive bucks flanked the rimed shoulder, their racks silhouetted in the headlamps. Along their route out of Pennsylvania, and into West Virginia, the road had been littered with deer carcasses. Those bucks terrified my mother, their wanton abandon, their hobbled death wish.</p>
<p>Up ahead burned lights, the town of Darden. From utility poles on abandoned Main Street swung stars and tinsel. Not a soul on the street, but lights burned in all the silent houses lining it, and many of them had strips of colored lights framing their lintels and hanging from the eaves. My mother skidded into a parking lot, under a neon sign in busted-out purple cursive: Elk Motor Court. A string of blue Christmas lights swagged across the front of the motel. Next door was Crider’s, a plywood store, spliced to a garage, no windows, with Esso pumps out front. On the other side of the river, smoke fumed out of the chimneys of little plank houses. Deer congregated on the bank.</p>
<p>It cost three dollars a night to stay at the Elk. Neither of my parents wanted to use real names, so they checked in as Mr. and Mrs. Charles O’Connor. The room was tiny. One bed with a baby blue chenille spread with a coin box like those attached to the bucking plaster kiddie ponies outside the A&amp;P. A dime made the bed vibrate. There was an unraveling fan-backed rattan chair. On the dresser, between a Bible and a green-faced alarm clock with white phosphorescent Roman numerals, sat a small black and white TV.</p>
<p>They left the room quickly and walked over to Crider’s. My mother could barely negotiate the frozen lot in her heels. Up on the mountain, a foot of snow had already fallen. It piled in the valley where they stood in the wind blowing off the brittle white river.</p>
<p>An old man with a long beard and galluses over a brown flannel shirt slumped behind Crider’s counter. He wore an old-fashioned snap-brim like the aged Italian men who stood on the corner of Larimer and Meadow in East Liberty. In the middle of the concrete floor blazed a pot-bellied black wood stove and a pile of split locust. Next to it was a large cardboard carton. The man asked them where they were from, where they were headed. My father explained that he and my mother were bound for the warm waters of Florida. My dad smiled at him and asked, “Are we close?”</p>
<p>The old man smiled back. “I reckon.” His voice was gravelly, but the inflection was padded and slow.</p>
<p>There was rue in the eyes of those two smiling men, one very old and one very young.  As if sharing a not entirely funny joke – that only they understood. As if they both knew, had always known, that my father and mother would never reach their destination. This old man: whose look my father recognized, who allowed in that look that he stood where he was behind that counter in Darden because he’d been thwarted himself, many years ago, in his original desire and destination. Not so much hard luck, but simply the way of it. He had taken his chance. We all choose. Just so. Not much to tell.</p>
<p>Because it was Christmas, because hope and illusion blazed so determinedly about them, the store man wanted to say to my father – whose mind, in turn, he was reading as well – that everything would be alright. Had he permitted himself to say it, maybe something would have opened up. Not just an opportunity for my mother and father, some windfall, some secret they’d discover, but even more than that – a hidden passage into another world, a staircase leading straight up through the roof and into the snowy mystery of the future. But the man hushed and time stood still.</p>
<p>My mother stood next to the stove, holding open her red coat to its warmth, head flung back, eyes closed, long brown hair hanging swinging out from her back. When she opened her eyes, the men were staring at her.</p>
<p>“Look in that box there,” the old man said to her. He came out from around the counter.</p>
<p>In the box were six baby rabbits, each the size of a coffee cup. They were silvery-brown with white blazes on their foreheads. Their eyes were tiny black pearls. They huddled together twitching on a pink blanket spread on the floor of the box.</p>
<p>“Oh my God,” my mother said.</p>
<p>“A dog killed the mama,” said the man.</p>
<p>“What’ll happen to them?”</p>
<p>“If they don’t die, we’ll raise them for the table.”</p>
<p>“You’ll eat them?” asked my mother.</p>
<p>“Yes, ma’am. If they don’t die.”</p>
<p>“May I have one?” My mother turned and looked at the man.</p>
<p>My father did not at all want a wild infant rabbit. It was an utterly absurd notion, no less absurd than borrowing Shelly Roth’s Cadillac for a trip to Florida, and then getting stranded in a blizzard in some Godforsaken mountain town in West Virginia – every bit of it predicated on a crazy dream my mother had had about her dead shoemaker father. But the number had hit. There was something to that. My mother was about to turn and ask him if they could adopt one of the rabbits. He knew that if he did not dig in right then and there, once and for all, and pronounce, “Hell, no, Rita, we’re not carting that rabbit along with us,” for the duration of his life on earth he would be powerless against her.</p>
<p>He didn’t want to lose her, but he didn’t know why he wanted her so much, or if he really wanted her at all. How could there be both? Wanting and not wanting? After not even half a day with her, she was already a habit – like dope or booze or cigarettes, things people fall in love with that destroy them. The old man was pinned down by my mother’s gaze. Maybe, like my father, he had never really known what he wanted. But Rita Schiaretta always knew what she wanted and when she wanted it – even if it was anathema. And in that moment – just before the old man, said, “Yes, ma’am, pick you one out,” and Rita turned to my father – Travis Sweeney accepted my mother and the sacred vow of fatalism to which he’d remain forever steadfast.</p>
<p>My mother looked at my father. He smiled at her, and said, “Of course,” before she opened her mouth.</p>
<p>She was bending into the box when the man added, “It’ll be dead by morning.”</p>
<p>Though my father knew this was true, he put his arm around my mother and the bunny she held in her arms and said, “Maybe not.”</p>
<p>“We’ll take care of him,” said my mother.</p>
<p>“Yes, we will,” my dad added.</p>
<p>“You got to feed him with an eyedropper,” said the man.</p>
<p>“We can do that. Can’t we, Travis?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely.”</p>
<p>The old man looked at my father. He understood every bit of what was going on, and he wanted my dad to know he knew. Not that he condemned him for it. He would have done the same thing. It was wrong for my father to give his consent on the rabbit. Wrong for the old man to permit it in the first place. He held my dad a moment longer in his stare. That little rabbit was going to die.</p>
<p>“Alright then,” the man said. “I’ll fix you up some formula.” He disappeared through a door at the back of the store that led to a bay. A car was up on the lift and, under it, a man with a mask and a blowtorch. Sparks rained down on him.</p>
<p>My parents, the tiny rabbit in the crook of my mother’s arm, walked along the dusty shelves. They bought cigarettes, a six-back of Tasmanian Lager, potato chips, a wedge of hoop cheese, bread, and chocolate milk.</p>
<p>When the man returned, he had a shoebox padded with rags and a little mason jar half-filled with white liquid. He handed these to my father and then an eye-dropper.</p>
<p>“You got to feed him every three hours. Just this. You give him anything else, you’ll kill him. And don’t give him too much.”</p>
<p>“What’s in it?” asked my mother.</p>
<p>“Little Karo syrup, sweet condensed milk, some egg yolk. It’s to be warm when you give it to him. Remember. Nothing else, but what’s in this. And keep that little thing warm. And feed him slow or you’ll drown him.”</p>
<p>“We’ll pay for that,” my dad offered.</p>
<p>“Well,” said the man. “I’m not giving you much. He’ll be dead in the morning.”</p>
<p>They waited for him to say something else. He and my father shook hands.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said my mother. Then she hugged the man, who closed his eyes and held her a moment.</p>
<p>When he came away, he said, “Don’t pet him. They can’t take handling.”</p>
<p>My mother and father turned with their groceries and the trembling rabbit, now held against my mother’s breast, under her coat, and walked out of the store.</p>
<p>Across the road from Crider’s was a church. In its front yard a crèche had been set up. Statues big as people. Cows and sheep too. They were difficult to make out for the pounding snow, the blurred pointillism. The statues moved – imperceptibly. They were real people. Like a play. Out there in a blizzard. Joseph and Mary and the shepherds. Real animals. Angels with wings and haloes. Even a real little baby. In awe, Rita and Travis paused and stared.</p>
<p>“Where are the Wise Men?” my mother asked.</p>
<p>“They’re lost,” explained my dad. “They won’t get here until January 6.”</p>
<p>“We’re not lost. Are we, Travis?”</p>
<p>“No, Rita, we’re not lost. Not in any conventional sense.”</p>
<p>“But we’re not there yet, are we?”</p>
<p>“Maybe not quite, but close. For most people, close is pretty good.”</p>
<p>“Let’s stay here, Travis, and wait for the Wise Men.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Christmas Eve, 1956, Travis Sweeney and Rita Schiaretta, independent of each other, contemplated stepping away from the destiny that awaited them in Pittsburgh, and accepting the invitation of that poor little one-horse town in the Appalachians ringed by mountains they couldn’t quite see for the snow storm. Without knowing it, they had stumbled across one of the invisible portals that exist in the mysterious ether – those we walk blindly by day in and day out: the entry into another life in another place, the chance to be better, to be the someone we desperately wish to be, the someone we actually are, but don’t realize. Through the scrim of snow, they had caught a blurred glimpse of that other life the old man at Crider’s had been on the verge of telling them about.</p>
<p>I want to say that portal is not so otherworldly, not some Twilight Zone-like parallel universe. I want to say that the fare into that other world, the better world, is love, but for that kind of love – the love that chooses happiness over self-immolation – my mother, though she desperately wanted it, was ill-equipped. She simply could not locate the seam bordering love and suffering.</p>
<p>My father knew nothing about tending a crop or livestock, how to split wood, drive a tractor. He was not that kind of man. He was not physically resourceful. He rarely got dirty. But he was unafraid of the earth he stood on at any given moment, of what it hides and might render. He was about to tell Rita this – in those very words since he realized that something was happening between them, that on that evening carefully wrought words mattered very much to her, that no one had ever talked to her the way he had – or at least gotten away with it. If he chose his words with precision and passion – I am unafraid of what the earth hides and might render – she would be his.</p>
<p>My mother saw in that little hamlet mantled in white a confounding, ineffable beauty for which she had no language. She thought about living there. But do what? She would have babies. She would dip her hands into the earth. She would plant a life there in Darden. Shriven of her father’s assassination by fire, her gypsy strega mother. The vendetta and recriminations. She could stop being Italian. And become Travis Sweeney’s.</p>
<p>Gazing down slumbering, snow-shrouded Main Street in Darden, West Virginia – a place that may not have even existed – the very Nativity itself hatching before her very eyes, she felt that perhaps this was her entrance into the dark heart about to explode in light. Then she pictured Shelly. Would he laugh at her? “You’re too smart for that, Rita. You can be somebody.” Living among these hicks, these hillbillies?</p>
<p>And these people? They were good people – in this little town. My mother could tell from the lights in their houses. Busting their asses trying to figure it out. No different from the Napolitano East Liberty peasants she issued from.</p>
<p>Shelly was a queer Jew dentist living above his shop on Highland Avenue. Plenty of nights he ended up in Fox’s, then later upstairs suffering. He knew the score. He might sit down and pull out a cigarette from his white tunic. Take both her hands. “Get out of East Liberty, Rita. Nothing’s ever going to happen again here. You’ve got that script memorized. You and Travis. You’re brilliant. You’re beautiful.” Shelly would laugh. “Move to West Virginia. Buy a farm. You’re only young once. Take a chance.”</p>
<p>But the country – the streams and fields, the sound of beasts in the woods, the dizzying vertigo of this altitude. Everything unchecked, unpaved, unbeholden. She’d grow angular, her mouth a hyphen, hair like dried black thistle. A thin faded blue dress with tiny yellow flowers on it.  Eyes out on her cheeks – a tetched Appalachian Napolitana. The land terrified her. She wanted high heels, to ride the streetcar downtown to Gimbel’s, go to the show. There probably wasn’t even a hospital or A&amp;P. Why not just take the banana boat back to Naples?</p>
<p>My father had been watching her, mesmerized. The blood red coat and high heels in a blizzard, cradling that baby rabbit against her, a powerful twenty-three year old girl skating along the blade of a razor. The cryptic Appalachian mountains peered far into the future, beyond Travis and Rita – their bit parts – and me, their only child, beyond my progeny’s progeny and even beyond the point where everything is forgotten.</p>
<p>My father had already learned to read my mother’s mind, a fabulous talent, but one that would aid him little over the years in predicting what she might do. He had fallen for her, for her wild, unbridled fear of earth, fear that would claw her hands through her long wavy brown hair – before she began to dye it blonde, against my father’s wishes – and pour invective like lighter fluid from her red lip-sticked mouth; and, often worse, suture in silence that same mouth for days, weeks – not even to eat, barely to breathe. Because her great power, her insupportable curse, was wielding silence like one might wield a blade or a revolver.</p>
<p>But they were still locked in that little vial of magic. It was in my father’s power to alter their course, to swerve out of the oncoming – with just a word. But which word? My mother was afraid.  That’s what it was, what it had always been. If my father would have said something, she’d follow him. That Christmas Eve in Darden, she would have followed him anywhere. But he had to say it. He had to have the backbone to say it.</p>
<p>When they got back to the The Elk, they wrapped the rabbit in towels and placed it on the bed. It lay peacefully on its side, its flank caving with each gentle suspiration. My mother rubbed its ears, and ran her fingers across its plush fur. The smoke from my parents’ cigarettes shone in the rabbit’s black oracular eyes.</p>
<p>“Rita, honey, you should try not to pet him too much.”</p>
<p>“I know, I know, but he’s such a baby.”</p>
<p>“He is. He’s dear.”</p>
<p>“You’re dear, Travis. The things you let yourself say are dear.” She laid her hand on my father’s. He looked down at their hands, locked on the blue spread.</p>
<p>“Rita,” my father said.</p>
<p>She smiled. “Tonight is more than anything I’ve ever done. It’s like a dream.”</p>
<p>My dad brought my mother’s beautiful hand to his lips and kissed it. “We should feed this bunny,” he said.</p>
<p>They warmed an eyedropper of formula with a Zippo. Rita placed the drowsy rabbit in her lap and fed it. It took the food slowly, deliberately. Little clicking noises as it sucked and swallowed. Two droppers.</p>
<p>“He’s hungry. He wants more,” Rita said.</p>
<p>“The guy at the store said don’t overdo it.”</p>
<p>“You think he’s okay. He’s going to be okay. Isn’t he, Travis?”</p>
<p>“I think he’ll be fine. We’ll follow instructions to the T. He’ll be fine.” It was 10 o’clock. My dad got up and set the alarm clock for 1 a.m. “But you should try not to pet him, Rita.”</p>
<p>My mother fondled the rabbit, now asleep in her arms. “That’s it,” she vowed. “I’m going to stop now. Poor little lamb.” She set the rabbit, wrapped in the towel, next to her on the bed, then patted the bed for my father. He lay down, the rabbit between them, and turned off the lamp. A blue swaying luster from the blowing Christmas lights beyond their window fell across the three of them. In a six foot drift, Shelly’s lone black Caddy brooded in the The Elk’s lot. Coyotes yammered from the ridge, but my parents mistook them for the yowling wind. They lay in silence, smoking cigarettes, for a long time.</p>
<p>Suddenly, my mother stood. “I’m going to get him settled. I’m afraid we’ll suffocate him.” She picked up the sleeping rabbit, cuddled it against her face, kissed it, swaddled it up again in its towel, tucked it back into its shoebox, walked a few steps to the dresser and set it down. She switched on the TV and dialed through the spastic stormy channels. “Maybe there’s something Christmassy.”</p>
<p>By the light of the TV, my dad spread the food from Crider’s on the bed. “Are you hungry, Rita?”</p>
<p>“I think I am.” Then: “This is all that’s coming in clear.” Bird of Paradise, with Louis Jourdan and Debra Paget. “Will he be warm enough, Travis?”</p>
<p>“I think he’ll be fine. We can put him on top of the TV once it heats up.”</p>
<p>My mother flopped on the bed. My parents drank whiskey from the motel’s cloudy plastic cups and the bitter beer straight from its blue cans. They ate the cheese and bread and potato chips. They drank the chocolate milk.</p>
<p>My dad whipped out a dime and dropped it in the slot. The bed groaned and twisted, shuddering like a cold car as it tries to turn over. My mother couldn’t even get her cigarette lit.</p>
<p>“You’re an ass, Travis,” she said, laughing.</p>
<p>The movie was tragic. A Frenchman (the dashing Jourdan) visits his high-born Polynesian college roommate’s island paradise, falls in love with his exotic, impossibly exquisite sister (Paget), marries her and remains on the island.</p>
<p>My mother plucked tissues from The Elk’s magenta Kleenex box. The gorgeous islands, the jungle birds soaring in the cloudless blue sky, the warm soft sparkling ocean reminded my parents that they were bound for the Atlantic. In both of them, simultaneously, grew a longing, the gnawing crave, for peace and goodness. There would never be quite a moment like this again between them. They, of course, had not known this then, nor should they have. There had been too much augury already in their bargain. But they did know: when you know, and that was enough to keep them together – God Help them – for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>The bed shuddered to a halt. My father leaned over and kissed my mother, gently and with honor. Their first kiss. My mother was a woman to stick a knife in a man she couldn’t suffer kissing her. My father kissed her again – with more ardor and intention. She knew then – as if in possession of the future, a talent passed on to her in blood by her mother – that she would never meet a more memorable man than Travis Sweeney.</p>
<p>She wore a pretty silver satiny blouse, and she began to unbutton and move out of it. It was clear, from the way she looked at my father, the cast of her depthless brown eyes, that this was part of the ritual, that he should in no way interfere. He sat and watched, realizing that the machinery of something completely unpredictable, but inevitable, had been set in motion.</p>
<p>She opened the blouse and lifted it upward off her shoulders, down her arms, behind her and held it spread open that way, like wings, for a moment. Her brown hair was long. She looked at my father who sat before her, mesmerized. She was his angel, not a good angel nor a bad angel, but merely a fallen confused one, like himself; and he almost interrupted her, halted her kermis, as if to go back in time, because more than anything, he was flooded with the certain knowledge that she would reveal to him terrible things. Had he dropped his eyes, or closed them, diverted his attention in the slightest, my mother would have retracted her wings, covered herself, pinned back her hair, and walked out into the blizzard.</p>
<p>My father did not even permit himself to blink or breathe. This moment had been foretold, somewhere in the writ, and there was no turning back. She folded the shirt and laid it across one of arms of the chair. Then she wiggled out of her skirt, bending her knees slightly, and twisting back and forth in a shimmy till it fell. She laid the skirt across the other chair arm and, with her back to my father, removed the rest of her clothing and dropped it in the lap of the chair.</p>
<p>Then she stilled, in the lamplight, fully illuminated. Her hair fell to her shoulder blades, then the long drop of her unmarked body – like a famous painting of a nude, maybe Renoir: that composed incandescent quality of an untouchable dream woman, a conjured woman, immured in paint on canvas and framed, though no less real for one’s longing for her. Perhaps it was the cast of gauzy light, from the lamp and television, where the taboo love between the Frenchman and the Polynesian had become clearly doomed, the plot lurching deeper and deeper into the darkness.</p>
<p>My mother was preparing to turn and face my father: to reveal whatever he had been summoned to this hidden patch in a mountain blizzard to reckon, and the unimaginable chain of events her turning would trigger. He had signed on for it. It was no longer his to halt. He’d not be spared the agonizing secrets of love: not merely what had been waiting so devoutly beneath her clothes, but the devastating tumult of her blood, and the vengeance meted out by it. Such rectitude was a long way off, yet my father Sweeney sensed it marshaling in her, like a freak blizzard lurking in a placid sky. There was nothing he could do to prevent it.</p>
<p>So he laid back against the headboard, swigged another ounce of Four Roses, lit a cigarette, just as my mother turned to face him, allowing him to study her in the light for just an instant – her breasts, the various intersections of her limbs and torso, the nuanced hollows, what she refused to cover, her arms at her sides, hands open mid-thigh, as if daring him to look away, as if testing him – before she extinguished the light of the lamp, as if lowering the curtain, on the last recorded second of Carita Schiaretta’s girlhood – Travis Sweeney, like a documentarian, there to record the moment.</p>
<p>She remained at the foot of the bed, now bathed in the holographic sepia convulsions of the television, and the watery purple light from the Elk Motor Court neon. Then she climbed onto the bed, snugged against my father like a second skin, and kissed him deeply, with intent and alarming might.  He wished desperately to open a window, at least gaze through it and assure himself of the frozen world.</p>
<p>Suddenly my mother sat up, perched cross-legged before him, clutched a corner of the blue spread, and covered herself. Her face, the hair spangled over it, and her partially concealed breasts were lavender.</p>
<p>“I still want to go to Florida, Travis.”  She fetched her whiskey.</p>
<p>“We’ll set out again tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“You promise?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do, Rita. For now, let’s drink to your old man, the philanthropist who funded this adventure.”</p>
<p>“To Papa Fred,” said my mother, raising her plastic cup. “The only decent thing he ever did.”</p>
<p>For a moment, before they drank, before they turned down the bedclothes, my grandfather, Federico, in one of the expensively tailored suits he somehow sported on cobbler’s wages, smoldered in front of them. He had crossed the ocean, Italy to America, that they might share this fateful night together in a Braxton County, West Virginia blizzard: his daughter, Carita, and a dreamy Black Irishman who aspired to nothing loftier than to be left to his thoughts.</p>
<p>When a deadly volcano erupted, Debra Paget, too beautiful to live, flung herself to appease the gods into its spewing mouth. My mother jumped up and snapped off the TV, reached into the shoebox, stroked the rabbit for a moment, and bundled it up again. Then she crumpled on the bed and wept. My dad pulled her to him, popped another dime into the box, and the two of them – not quite there, but closer every moment – resumed their journey to the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Some time, during the long holy night, as the snow prognosticated, my mother rose, and placed back in bed between her and my father the slumbering rabbit.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Through his good eye, the boy could only just make out the passing trees, boulders, and bushes in the little light they received from the moon, which was veiled by a river of mist coasting a dozen yards above his head. A gust of early morning wind through the river valley brazed the bare skin of the boy’s hands. He pulled them into the sleeves of his parka and crouched low against the bow of the drift boat. From there he looked up at his father, who sat above in the crossbar seat, crowned by a headlamp, correcting their drift with his large wooden oars.<br />
<strong>~</strong><br />
The father’s headlamp shot a spotlight here and there along the river and the bank and occasionally on the boy. The father liked that the air smelled of damp vegetation and earth. He also liked that the only sounds were of waking birds, crowded stalks of brush rubbing together, and the occasional gurgles and slurps of slow moving water. He liked these smells and sounds because they reminded him that he existed in the natural world; sometimes during his long days working the assembly line, as he rehashed the same blunt action over and over, like a machine, it felt as though he did not.<br />
<strong>~</strong><br />
The boy lived with his mother in an apartment in the city. His mother worked at a department store most days and as a waitress at a chain diner two nights a week. The boy took the metro bus to parochial school and back during the school year. He was responsible for the washing of clothes and dishes and the preparation of dinner during the days his mother worked.</p>
<p>The boy spent one weekend a month with his father, who lived two hours north. His mother told him she wished that he didn’t have to visit his father, but that they had no choice. Every month, upon his return, she urged the boy to tell her everything that happened, even if there didn’t seem to be anything worth telling.<br />
<strong>~</strong><br />
The boy was very small for his age, and the way he now crouched deep into the bow of the boat diminished his stature even more.</p>
<p>The man tried his best not to blame the boy and the boy’s mother for his size, but it was difficult because the man believed that had he stuck around, the boy would have turned out more substantial.<br />
<strong>~</strong><br />
The boat shifted and rocked as the boy and his father switched places.</p>
<p>The boy felt the warmth leftover from his father on the seat. He palmed the oars and felt the warmth there, too.</p>
<p>Whenever he thought of his father, the first image that came into the boy’s mind was the domed curvature of his eyes and the hawkish way they protruded from his sockets. Even in pictures his look could startle.</p>
<p>There on the river, the boy couldn’t see his father’s eyes, only the cool glow the headlamp lent his father’s breath, which twisted and spun in front of his lips before dissolving. But those eyes never left the boy’s imagination; the figments remained fixed to his father’s face, even in the dark.<br />
<strong>~</strong><br />
The father slid a leather case from beneath a storage shelf below the gunwale of the port side of the drift boat. He unzipped the case and slid out a rifle. The beam of the headlamp searched up and down the length of the rifle, illuminating small circles of its structure with light.<br />
<strong>~</strong><br />
Though the boy had never before seen a rifle in person, the rifle was not the object that captured his attention; it was the brass shells. In the light of his father’s headlamp they shined like pieces of gold. These shiny thimbles were what rifles hurled through the air. These glossy gems were what plugged holes into skin and hide.<br />
<strong>~</strong><br />
The father had many memories of his own father, but the beatings stood out. His father, when drunk, struck him and his sisters with his hands and his knees and his cane and his belt and his shoes and even once with a ceramic lamp.</p>
<p>The time with the lamp had left a crescent-shaped scar on the back of his head, around which hair still refused to grow. The scar was on the back of his head because, at the time of the blow, he was crouched over his younger sister to protect her from the storm.</p>
<p>The boy’s father tried to understand his own father, but couldn’t, even though he ended up working in the same factory, drinking the same beer, and sipping the same bourbon from the same flask at his lunch break. He didn’t understand him, even though he too married a woman who wanted to save him from himself, even though he too had children he hoped would change him in the ways he felt he should.<br />
<strong>~</strong><br />
One fine morning in a September of his childhood, the boy’s father and his own father went out fishing before dawn. There the father learned how best to catch salmon. One came upon them unawares in the dark, using the headlamp as a guide, and fired a shot just above the fish’s snout. The rifle shot would serve as a concussion blast and the salmon would float stunned to the surface.</p>
<p>That it was illegal to do this, that they agreed no one else should know, that they made up a plausible story should they be questioned about poaching, all of this only made the time between the boy’s father and his father more special.<br />
<strong>~</strong><br />
The jet stream of mist above the river had now sunk to eye level and the boy, through his good eye, watched its small shimmering beads glisten in the light of his father’s headlamp. The boy could also feel it dampen his lips, but not his cheeks on account of their chill.</p>
<p>In the haze and lumen from the headlamp his father’s outline stood, the butt of the rifle against one shoulder, hand fanned over trigger, his other stretched out, palm up, steadying the barrel.</p>
<p>The spotlight beam of the father’s lamp followed slow, searching arcs across the surface of the river. Where it struck, the water turned shallow green, like that of half-brewed tea.<br />
<strong>~</strong><br />
The salmon floated, white belly breaching the surface, toward the boat, just as the rifle report ceased echoing along the canyon. The father reached out and sunk the net into the water and then hoisted it up, pausing for a moment before setting it down in the hull, so the boy could see the shuddering arc of the salmon bulge in the bottom of the fluorescent green netting.</p>
<p>Chinook, said the man to the boy. See the mouth? That’s how you tell it’s a hen.</p>
<p>This was verbatim what his own father had said to him years earlier.</p>
<p>The boy nodded.</p>
<p>In the light of the headlamp, the father noticed the opaque film covering one of the boy’s eyes and remembered that it was a fake. The boy had lost his real eye as a result of the father striking him with the palm of his hand. The father struck him with the palm of his hand because the boy had been using some of his father’s prized baseball cards for spoke flaps on his bicycle.</p>
<p>Since the event, the father often reminded himself that it was an accident, and that it had occurred while delivering a punishment that was justified, a punishment meant to teach the boy a lesson he needed to learn.</p>
<p>The father reminded himself of this often, because the image of the boy’s real eye dangling loose against the boy’s young pink cheeks appeared in his mind often, and the shortness of breath accompanying the image wouldn’t go away without a fight.<br />
<strong>~</strong><br />
The chrome, green, and blue salmon dazzled in the light of the headlamp, but gave off a harsh smell, somewhere between asparagus and gasoline. The boy reached out and touched its silvery skin near the tail. It felt smooth, a little slimy. Little lumps lined the white scaling near the posterior fin, resembling little pearls.</p>
<p>The boy’s father coughed into his fist a few times then caught his breath. Finally, he said: Sea lice. This hen’s fresh from the salt. Maybe even came up yesterday.</p>
<p>His father wiped the bugs from the salmon with his finger then flicked them into the water.<br />
<strong>~</strong><br />
When a moth became trapped inside their apartment in the city, the boy’s mother would capture it between her palms and release it out the window.</p>
<p><strong>~</strong><br />
The boy’s father pulled a sheath from the front pocket of his jeans and slid out a bone-handled knife. With the blade he crunched a hole through the fish’s skull.</p>
<p>There was something brutal, the boy felt, about the snapping of the bones. It wasn’t a sound he had heard before. The boy wished he had never heard it. He felt he would hear it now in his dreams. He felt now he knew the salmon in a way he wished he didn’t.</p>
<p>The boy watched the fish in its death throes. Gills bleeding, the salmon opened its mouth and wiggled. Its pupils widened beneath the glow of the headlamp and its body curved, as if stretching.</p>
<p>The boy felt something stretching inside of his skin as well.<br />
<strong>~</strong><br />
The officer wore large aviator glasses that reflected the surroundings in a distorted way. Wedged beneath his armpit was a notepad. In his fingers spun a pencil. He strolled around the boat and looked inside. He set his notebook on the ground and leaned deep into the boat. His feet nearly left the ground.</p>
<p>The officer exhaled audibly and returned to his feet. He picked up his notebook and flipped a few pages. He took off his glasses and slid them between two buttons of his tan collared shirt.</p>
<p>Let’s start with your licenses, he said.<br />
<strong>~</strong><br />
The boy had been taught by his mother not to lie. The boy had been taught by his father not to lie. The boy had been taught in parochial school not to lie. This had left the boy unprepared to lie. He was willing, but without practice.<br />
<strong>~</strong><br />
A gust of canyon wind rattled the papers in the father’s hand. He stretched the papers flat against his knees and finished reading, there on the picnic bench near the boat landing. When finished, he folded them up and slid them into his breast pocket, where they stuck up nearly to his collar.</p>
<p>The tires of the officer’s tan pickup truck spun gravel as they carried the rest from the parking lot.<br />
<strong>~</strong><br />
The father and the boy sat next to each other in the cab as they drove along the empty highway, towing the drift boat behind. Neither of them had said a word. The boy felt as though his lungs didn’t work, that they wouldn’t fill up. He tried his best not to reveal this.<br />
<strong>~</strong><br />
His father’s chapped lips wrapped snug around a cigarette while his teeth worked on something behind it. A vein popped up and disappeared on the side of his forehead in rhythm with his grinding. His hawkish eyes strained out of their sockets.</p>
<p>He settled his foot onto the breaks and palmed the gearshift down a few notches and slowed onto the shoulder of the highway until they were stopped.<br />
<strong>~</strong><br />
The boy picked his fake eye from the floor of the truck and licked his fingers and began to rub the eyeball clean in his palm. It felt warm to the touch.</p>
<p>His father said, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean–</p>
<p>The boy interrupted him and said, It’s okay.</p>
<p>The boy said this because it did feel okay, now that the ridge along his eyebrow throbbed, now that the inside of his empty eye socket was hot and itchy, now that the side of his face felt as though a hot moist towel was being pressed against it. The world felt somehow righted. He didn’t understand why, but there was now more room in his lungs to fill with breath.</p>
<p>The father reached over and hugged the boy.</p>
<p>The boy leaned in.</p>
