								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Southern Cross the Dog</em> recounts the odyssey of young Robert Chatham, as first-time novelist Bill Cheng portrays the themes of racial tension, adolescent love, emotional hardships, and the destruction incurred by nature.  As he travels throughout the South, Robert faces many trials and tribulations, all of which test his will to survive and mold his views of life and Southern society.  Channeling William Faulkner in his use of dialects and depiction of Southern life, Cheng illustrates Robert’s physical passage throughout the South as he grapples with his mental struggle between the past and future.</p>
<p>As Cheng portrays the obstacles Robert faces in his trek throughout the Deep South, the 8-year-old protagonist faces the trauma of the Great Flood of 1927 amidst the social and economic trauma of the Depression.  Also set in the Jim Crow era of heightened racial tensions and legal segregation, <em>Southern Cross the Dog</em> directly tackles these topics.  However, the novel lacks true focus as Cheng waffles between a myriad of characters, places, and time periods.  After the world around him collapses and is washed away, Robert journeys through Mississippi, a land Cheng himself had never experienced before authoring his Southern novel.  During this devastating flood, “houses [bleed] out their insides” as people “[bubble] up swollen and drowned, rag-dolling in the current.”  This Flood, an allegory stretching beyond that of Noah’s biblical tale, incurs this violent cleansing upon Robert, his family, and his community.  The storm ravages both the physical town and the young protagonist’s youth; it is the brutal force of nature that shapes Robert’s journey and his sense of self throughout this epic novel.</p>
<p>Carrying this religious significance beyond the novel’s initial pages, Cheng also weaves major religious themes in the fabric of his story.  Throughout the novel, the dog motif invokes the devil, and constantly haunts Robert throughout his journey.  In the section entitled “Hotel Beau-Miel (1932),” Robert hears the “dog pace anxiously outside Percy’s Pharmacy.”  Robert believes the dog’s barks “[sound] far away and haunting, calling out from the world’s end.”  Here Cheng again invokes religious allegories, referencing the apocalypse.  Cheng infuses the dog with this otherworldly, devilish nature.  The dog seems to straddle these two worlds, looming over Robert’s physical senses and consciousness; Cheng similarly straddles the line between presenting a true southern novel and a southern parody.  This magnified fear stems from stories he had heard about these animals.  All of Cheng’s religious references seem to suggest the presence of sin and the need for humanity to be cleansed.  Framed by his interactions with people on the fringes of society, such as the wily fur-trappers, Cheng’s depictions of these societal outskirts are meant to juxtapose with his many references to the heart of religious themes. The allegories serve to complicate the nature of the novel, yet also evoke this call for redemption for both Robert and the South.  Part Four is even titled, “A Shining New South,” reverberating these mandates for redemption and salvation.</p>
<p>As Robert continues his journey, he makes his way through a whorehouse, treacherous swamp, and even the racial prejudice abounding in the Southern United States during the 20th century.  Robert’s physical passage throughout Mississippi mirrors his navigation through this myriad of racial issues and the individuals he encounters.  While African-Americans are no longer confined to the bonds of slavery, figurative chains remain in place, stunting the development and change of Southern society after the Civil War; Cheng fuses religion and racial tension to convey this commentary.  Robert experiences various racial situations and individuals affected by these laws in his travels.  In a flashback, Robert recounts his birthday the previous year.  On this occasion, he wanders into a dirty, empty bar with this friendly sign: “coloreds welcome.”  Here, a kind white man emerges from a trap door, offers him a seat at the counter, and gives him a sandwich on the house.</p>
<p>As evidenced in this scene, Cheng frequently jumps around in the chronology of his narrative, oftentimes oscillating between the past and present.  Then he flashes forward in the narrative, highlighting Robert’s sexual encounter with the white bar owner’s mentally handicapped African-American daughter.  This departure from cross-raced kindness to this fleeting sexual episode provides a new shade on race relations, evoking the sensibility of Tom Jones, Fielding’s eighteenth century picaresque novel.  Molly Seagrim seduces Tom in the novel, just as the bar owner’s daughter ignites sexual relations between herself and Robert.  In this novel of survival and racial strain, Robert even works as a slave laborer in the swamp, yet manages to escape.  When he disappears, Robert is referred to as the “missing Negro,” and is filed “among the other transients of the country.”  He emerges from the depth of the swamp “half dead and all the way alive” and into a zealous colored church service about the Devil.  In this scene, Cheng cleverly unites race, religion, and the dog motif.  Preaching to the congregation, the reverend roars “That low sniffling dog that howls at your back door!  Hear him, brothers, hear!  He calls for blood!”  Startled by the sermon, Robert seeks Eli’s help, yet is rebuffed.  While the book itself is fragmented into six sections and often jumps forward and backward in time, Robert’s sense of time is similarly fractured.  Cheng writes “The one truth God has ever given to a man.  And it’s that the past keeps happening to us.  No matter who we are or how far we get away, it keeps happening to us.”  Robert finally reaches where the “Southern cross the Dog,” two iconic railroads, which Cheng manipulates to depict the Southern world and society’s interactions with the Devil, a force Robert battles throughout his odyssey.</p>
<p>Uniting these themes as well as Robert’s fragmented sense of time and consciousness, Cheng attempts to present this coming of age novel, both concerning his young protagonist and the South.  Unfortunately, Cheng’s attempts are just that; he shies away from a thorough presentation of plot and loses the reader in the overdone time oscillations, fragmentations, and frequent narrator shifts.  While <em>Southern Cross the Dog</em> certainly possesses gleams of brilliance, Cheng’s debut novel falls short of becoming the iconic, successful novels of predecessors such as Faulkner and Twain.  Each of the novel’s landscapes represents new territory for both Robert and Cheng, territory that Cheng endeavors to navigate, but through which he ultimately remains off-track.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/631/files/2013/11/guestsonearth.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-718" alt="guestsonearth" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/631/files/2013/11/guestsonearth.jpeg" width="159" height="241" /></a>Lee Smith’s has long written perceptively about Southern women (<em>Family Linen, Oral History, Saving Grace</em>), and her new novel, <em>Guests on Earth</em>, is no exception.  Grounded in the 1948 burning of the Highland Hospital in Asheville, North Carolina, the novel tells the story of an orphan from New Orleans, Evalina Toussaint, who is admitted to the hospital as a young girl and lives out much of her young life there, as patient and guest.</p>
<p>Readers may already be aware that Zelda Fitzgerald, the hospital’s most famous patient, died in the fire, but the details of her frenetic dancing and painting add drama and shape to the novel.  Fitzgerald is not the center of this story, however; she comes and goes, as she did in life.  It is Evalina’s early life with a disturbed, talented mother and her episodes of friendship, rivalry, and partnership with the various inhabitants of Highland that drive the plot.</p>
<p>The novel is episodic and covers a long period of time.  Evalina comes to the hospital, grows up, leaves for a while and returns; she makes friends and loses them; she falls into and out of love.  The fates of patients who have left is sometimes reported second- or third-hand.  The sequences are loosely connected, mostly by the proximity of Evalina to the persons, events, and reporting of news.  The “Intermezzo” section, which tells several years of Evalina’s young adulthood through letters, departs even more radically from the conventional narration of the rest.</p>
<p>What holds the novel together is the evolution of Evalina’s character.  She comes to Highland a frightened child, having already lived through her mother’s and a humiliating Jane-Eyre-like experience of living with her mother’s lover’s wife and children.  But she is the novel’s narrator—a rather old-fashioned intrusive one at that—and she establishes her credibility on the first page.  So as the other patients appear, disappear, and sometimes reappear, Evalina can be trusted to describe them and comment on their various illnesses, and the novel becomes both a fictional memoir and a commentary on both the history mental health treatment and the pressures that drive unusual personalities into “insanity.”</p>
<p>Several of the female characters, including Fitzgerald, are driven to the hospital by their inability to live the professional lives they seek, by their unhappy, inescapable marriages, or by seemingly well-meaning judges who misinterpret desperation or sexual assertion as “moral imbecility.”  But this is not just a book about women, though they figure largely in the number of Highland’s patient list.  The young boy Robert, whose genius and social awkwardness mark him for institutionalization, the war veteran suffering from shell shock, and the young man called Pan, who prefers to live outdoors all find refuge—for a time—in the progressive treatments at the hospital.</p>
<p>Some readers will find the “Intermezzo” section odd, and there are a few episodes, such as the one late in the novel when a friend returns with two men and tries to convince Evalina to run off with them, go nowhere (In this case Evalina turns down the invitation and returns to the hospital).  Other readers may object that the historical figure of real interest is Zelda Fitzgerald, and her intermittent appearance is a flaw in the structure.  In this instance, however, the absences of the more famous historical figures actually keeps the focus on the variety and number of other, equally complex and valuable persons who inhabit the hospital.</p>
<p>The way Zelda Fitzgerald comes and goes also keeps the center of the narrative on Evalina, and when she connects the memory of Zelda with the memory of her mother, Evalina ties the book together very nicely indeed.  The mother seems to disappear from the story when she dies, but in fact she has lived on in the empathetic responses of her daughter, whose refusal to judge harshly, in turn, creates empathy for the misunderstood, misdiagnosed, and often mistreated characters who find their ways to the hospital.</p>
<p>As a historical novel, then, <em>Guests on Earth</em> is somewhat unusual.  The great cataclysmic cultural and political events, such as war and changing notions of the human mind, are certainly present, but they do not loom over the entire book.  Nor is the story dominated by a larger-than-life historical figure.  This is a quiet novel, and its most moving tragedies are local, domestic, and often private, yet they are tragedies all the same, and the as book seems to wind its way through these many lives, it keeps its compass firmly pointed on Evalina.  The ending seems inevitable, though certainly not predictable, and with the skill of a master novelist, Lee Smith brings together all of the narrative paths to a single, beautiful moment in a conclusion that stops the story not so much at completion as at a satisfying stepping-stone back into the present day.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Black Lawrence Press, 2012</p>
<p>Beneath a serious photo of himself in blazer and glasses, author Adam Prince’s webpage contains the following quote from his debut collection of short stories: “Because lust was a region into which the critical mind could only get so far. You could talk evolutionary psychology; you could talk feminism or Freud or the way it should be, but those were only dirt roads into lust, and sometime in the night, they would be washed away.”</p>
<p>In <em>The Beautiful Wishes of Ugly Men</em>, Prince sets out to explore the outer fringes of what men want.  The title of the collection suggests that at the end of the journey readers might arrive clutching something basic and revelatory, some insight into how men think.</p>
<p>The eleven stories in the collection feature men in the midst of midlife crises, no matter what age they are.  From the narrator of the first story, who celebrates his girlfriend’s pregnancy by getting high with a young stripper, to the aging reunion-goer of the last story, struggling to recapture illusory happiness through a last-minute marriage proposal to a high school crush, these characters face difficult choices between who they are and who they could be.</p>
<p>Take the tightly-paced initial story, “Big Wheels for Adults.”  The title dredges up somewhat tired coming-of-age rhetoric.  It perfectly describes the story beneath, of two childhood friends, now men in their early thirties, who arrange a wild night at a strip club.  A few days before the outing, the narrator discovers his girlfriend is pregnant.</p>
<p>The night of the strip club outing becomes the setting for darker questions about the soul, the life that is, and the life of dreams.  Peter, the narrator, loves his girlfriend Carli, but their relationship lacks passion.  Compared to strippers, Carli is “thicker, more ordinary.”</p>
<p>Prince spells out the source of Peter’s dissatisfaction even more clearly: “Sometimes when I’m out with her and a beautiful woman walks by, it isn’t just lust I feel, but rage,” Peter thinks, followed by, “you have to settle…you always do.”</p>
<p>Peter’s inner conflict spills over into the public realm when the men befriend two of the dancers, Crystal and Hope.  Hope “[is] one of the best-looking women Peter [has] ever seen in real life.”  Peter and his friend end up back at Crystal’s house, where after a few lines of coke – it’s that easy! &#8211; Hope offers herself to Peter fully, sexually.  He is conscious “of the shortness of her shorts, the contours of her thighs, the fact that she wore no bra or make-up and didn’t need to.”  (Contrast her body, of course, with the absent Carli’s.)</p>
<p>For a man on a bender with a really hot chick, Peter doesn’t seem to be having a very good time.  He drowns in a maelstrom of doubt.  Does he stay with Carli and become a father, or does he escape into a world of unmoored passions?  “It [is] a question of high highs and low lows versus stability,” he decides.</p>
<p>He puts distance between himself and sexual opportunity by fleeing to the porch.  Hope eventually joins him and they sit together watching the sun rise, in what might be the world’s most obvious attempt at symbolism.  Finally, when all hope of hooking up with Hope has passed, Peter announces Carli’s pregnancy.</p>
<p>Peter doesn’t really choose Carli, although maybe he defaults to her.  It’s not any beautiful wish – to be a good husband, to start a family – that stops him, but the rawest thing of all; fear of living his fantasy.  Peter pulls back his hand from plucking the forbidden fruit.  And if the options that Peter faces seem extreme and broadly drawn – the earnest wife, the sexy stripper – that’s less Peter’s fault than Prince’s, who doesn’t quite transcend the tropes that comprise his story.</p>
<p>For a story collection with a promising title – one that suggests unexpected dichotomies of beauty and ugliness, seen and unseen &#8211; Prince rarely questions conventional types.  The characters are usually what they appear to be.  In “Ugly Around Him,” a man obsesses over his wife’s weight gain following pregnancy.  He refers to her as his “fat wife” four times before he mentions her name.  If the younger woman is a sex object, “the wife” appears almost universally in these stories as an anti-sex object, a cage and a trap.</p>
<p>In “Island of the Lost Boys”, the narrator struggles with his glamorous, absent mother, summing her up thusly, “she is beautiful and beauty is like that.”  But like what, exactly?  Distant and unattainable?  The constant references to beauty and ugliness, and Prince’s need to separate characters neatly into one of these two camps, proves to be the collection’s greatest weakness.  The characters struggle to surprise, and there is little movement within these stories, internally or externally.</p>
<p>And then there’s Prince’s writing style, which veers between accomplished and awkward.  His sentences sometimes betray him, as in the following, “And as he spoke, he began to think about the difficulty of accounting for the distance between who a person was and who that person would like to be, between ourselves and the performances we put on for those we hope will love us.”  How about the difficulty of switching point of view mid-sentence?   Or the following sentence, which ends the collection: “he kneels down onto one arthritic knee.”  Is there any other way to kneel but “down”?</p>
<p>The internal landscape of male desire is hardly uncharted territory.  Try the rich, burning sentences of “A Sport and a Pastime,” in which a young Yale dropout seduces and discards a French woman he meets in that country.  What saves that tawdry tale is James Salter’s stylistic mastery, his ability to craft sentences that leave a sensual aftertaste as intense as the richest French pastry.  The tangible chemistry of the story redeems, or at least contrasts nicely with, the main character’s spiritual vacancy.</p>
<p>Or, in a more modern era, Nicholson Baker’s crisp and flippant <em>Vox</em>, which reinvents paid phone sex between strangers as an act of truant intimacy.  A man and a woman trade increasingly daring sexual confidences in a conversation that builds to a climax even while remaining entirely auditory.</p>
<p>Finally, finally, there’s the classic master of ugly sexy beauty – Nabokov.  The parasitic HH’s luscious odes to his teenage lover in Lolita belie the notion that love is anything other than an erotic construction.</p>
<p>Many authors have suggested that people are the sum of their parts.  Many authors have written lovely, complex stories in which women, and to an extent men, are little more than objects.  And many authors have used sex as a way into bigger divisions and ambiguities.  While it may be unfair to compare Prince and Nabokov, it is fair to point out that his is a familiar and therefore difficult subject.</p>
<p>In the end, the only story in <em>Beautiful Wishes of Ugly Men</em> that lives up to the collection’s title is the final one, “A. Roolette? A. Roolette?” – in which a crowd of attendees at a 50th high school reunion reflect on the loves they have and have not pursued.  At the end, one of the graduates – realizing at last that life is short – goes down on one knee to propose to the girl he was in love with in high school.</p>
<p>The idea that her beauty can return him to the youth he lost or correct a life lived imperfectly – that is a lovely wish, despite the “arthritic” state of his body.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>A Different Sun</em> gives imaginative life to characters who actually existed – the daughter of a Georgia plantation owner and the charismatic missionary whom she married, travelling with him to West Africa in the mid nineteenth-century.  Lurana Davis Bowen and Thomas Jefferson Bowen (renamed Emma and Henry in the novel) were the first Southern Baptist missionaries to venture into Africa.  Although Lurana’s journal is the main source for the narrative, the novel’s richly textured Africa owes much to Elaine Orr’s own upbringing in Nigeria.</p>
<p>Emma’s early embrace of Christianity is presented as a reaction against the injustices of the slaveowning South into which she’s born.  This world is briefly conjured – it’s difficult really to delineate plantation life without falling into cliché, and some things ring false, such as Emma’s inner denomination of an elderly slave as “the gentleman she called Uncle Eli” – before the novel has her married to the charismatic Henry Bowman, formerly a Texas Ranger with a somewhat sleazy past, now a passionate missionary to Africa.  Orr manages to make Christian commitment sexy and brave, carrying as it does the weight of a moral opposition to slavery.  She also evokes Emma’s quiet and steady devotion with conviction, especially through the short diary entries in which Emma gives thanks for small acts of grace.</p>
<p>The novel is focalized through Emma, and the reader becomes intimate with her sharp observations and ethical questioning, and with her bodily responses to her new world and to her changeable, difficult husband.  The initial sexual attraction is boldly done – “They left the parlor for another walk in the orchard – the minister without his frock coat – and when Emma saw the way his trousers fell across his backside, she knew what is meant by desire” (41) – and throughout the novel, for all the vicissitudes of their relationship, Henry exerts a powerful physical effect on Emma which is nicely rendered in Orr’s always striking metaphors –  “his voice a golden glow pouring through her” (32); “She felt a flower open in her chest and she laughed” (377).  The novel conjures well the unusual physical closeness which she and her husband experience by virtue of their missionary lifestyle.   In Africa, he has to deliver their children, she to nurse him during his bouts of malarial delirium.  Henry’s illness also throws Emma and their African servant, Jacob, into an erotic intimacy, which is less successfully realized. The occasional chapter narrated from Henry’s point-of-view, however, is compelling – especially later on, as the marriage comes under increasing pressure from his illness and her growing assertiveness.  At its heart, for all its commitment to large topics such as race and religion, A Different Sun is a portrait of a marriage – a husband and wife who grow to know each other in extraordinary but liberating circumstances.</p>
<p>The physical challenges and sensory stimuli of Africa are well evoked, although Emma’s bodily responses become a little predictable – “The interspersed beats [of the drummers] entered Emma, and she felt the vibration inside her” (199).  The way in which Emma adapts to Africa’s dirt and dangers as she builds a succession of domestic spaces is intrinsic to her development as a character, and it’s through her discriminating consciousness that the novel demonstrates the dismantling of national and racial barriers, and an uneasy reconciliation of Christian faith with older African beliefs.</p>
<p>The novel makes much of a couple of key objects – Emma’s portable writing box, at which she writes her diary; and a wooden letter-opener carved by Uncle Eli, the elderly slave whose West African roots make him a mysterious link between Georgia and the African itinerary which Emma and Henry pursue.  Near the end of the novel, Emma finds the pattern on the carving duplicated on a piece of Yoruban printed cloth and learns that it represents “completeness”.  She buries the carving as part of a cleansing ritual which apparently contributes to her husband’s recovery from illness.  The act seems to signify a reconciliation of Christian and African spiritual practices; also a kind of atonement for Emma’s implication in slavery.  Wisely, the narrator leaves such interpretations as suggestions only (this summary is necessarily reductive), and one of the novel’s strengths is its resistance to interpretation and its quiet subtlety (rather undermined by the cover blurb’s proclamation of “high adventure” and declaration that “Every day brings new tragedy and heartbreak”).</p>
<p>The writing box and Emma’s journal entries are presented with a sometimes overdone solemnity.  Of course, the historically real diary of Lurana Davis Bowen is the source for the whole novel, and hence a crucial and tangible force; but the novel’s thematization of the act of writing seems unnecessary (bearing the traces of its author’s academic background, perhaps), since its emotional focus is not really on Emma’s writing, but on her apprehension of Africa and her embrace of otherness.  <em>A Different Sun</em>&#8216;s origins in the real-life experiences of the Bowens seems also to account for its plotlessness: it’s a finely rendered imagining of a distinctive world, but has a meandering feel and a downbeat ending.  The “Discussion Questions” at the end of the book close by asking, “If you were the author of the story, how would you write the sequel?”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rebecca Lee’s new short story collection, <em>Bobcat and Other Stories</em> (Algonquin 2013), centers on the lives of young adults, most of whom are in college or newly embarking on marriage and careers.  In prose that I often found deft and engaging, Lee explores the dreams, fantasies, and hopes of her characters.  Romantic attachments and marital infidelities play a large role, usually dramatized, unsurprisingly, at dinner parties and casual social gatherings.</p>
<p>The title story begins the book, and its fixation on flashbacks to the college days of the characters that assemble for a meal at the narrator’s house sets up the rest of the work well.  Tales intersect as the evening moves along:  the bobcat attack that has cost one woman her arm, the family history of one guest who is descended from the Donner Party family.  These various narratives are woven together through conversation, mostly, though the narrator reminisces and summarizes her own judgments on her companions, as in this passage, when she remembers discovering, during a late-night conference, that her law partner, who is at the dinner, is being unfaithful to his wife with a young paralegal named Lakshmi:</p>
<p>What the hell was Lakshmi doing here with a little Danish in a bag?  I knew what that little Danish meant . . . .It was irresistible, of course, it represented the whole world outside our sterile, deadlocked conference room, the ongoing life of midtown even deep into the middle of the night. . . . As Ray conferred with Lakshmi in the hallway, I sat inside the room, waiting, growing more furious by the second.  The phone rang again, and without really looking, I opened the door and thrust it out toward Ray.  “It’s your wife,” I said.</p>
<p>The revelation of this secret seems to be where the characters are headed, but like all the stories in this collection, the action suddenly veers, and another problem, more immediate to the narrator, presents itself at the end.</p>
<p>The settings of Bobcat move from Canada to somewhere near Cape Fear to Hong Kong.  Whether they are in Wisconsin or Saskatchewan, however, the characters in these stories all seem to be cut from the same small set of patterns.  There are writers of novels, TV scripts, and memoirs.  There are husbands and would-be husbands, mostly gentle, articulate, and well-read (though frequently unfaithful).  There are professors galore.  There are two unrelated characters in two different stories with significant facial tics.  The houses are all filled with flowers and good food, and the children are, for the most part, benign and faceless.</p>
<p>What’s more, the characters all sound alike.  The narrators are all sensitive and introspective, like their friends, lovers, and spouses.  They cite or quote literary texts.  The professors and fathers are all a little pompous and controlling.  Whether they’re young or old, male or female, Romanian or American, however, everybody in this book sounds pretty much like everybody else.  I was thirteen pages into “Fialta” before I realized that this narrator was male, because the voice sounded so much like all of the female speakers.  The one outstanding exception is Professor Pine in “Slatland,” who says things like “’Slatland, flatland, mapland’ . . . . ‘Pardon me, Margit.  I know so many languages that sometimes I say words out of place.’”  But then he turns out to be one of the two characters with facial tics.</p>
<p>The words “sort of,” “actually,” and “really” also began to stand out because they are used so frequently and by so many characters.  This example, from “Bobcat,” is typical:  “I had always found her sort of moving, actually.”  If these expressions came only from a narrator, I might assume that Lee was using them artfully.  But many characters talk this way, and by the end of the book, the phrases begin to pile up into sentences like this one, from “World Party”:  “he had been actually really charming.”</p>
<p>Now, there’s nothing inherently wrong with these words, used to characterize a certain kind of speaker, and I don’t mean to suggest that they show up on every page.  They don’t.  Their frequent appearance, however, along with the other similarities of character, gave an air of repetitiveness to the stories in <em>Bobcat</em>, that, in the end, left me unsatisfied.  The metaphors and descriptions in this book are very good, too good to be marred by carelessness or monotony, and I hope, for this reason, that the next time I pick up a volume by Rebecca Lee, it will be a novel.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/631/files/2013/08/Dickey.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-446" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/631/files/2013/08/Dickey.jpeg" alt="Dickey" width="300" height="230" /></a>A few weeks ago, after  I sent a query to a widely known magazine (which will remain unnamed) about their possible interest in a review of <em>The Complete Poems of James Dickey</em>, the response was understandable, if peculiar (and this response is paraphrased to protect the innocent): “We don’t really see the worth of such a review, since it’s just an anthology of all his poems.” After deciding to bring the review to <em>Shenandoah</em> instead, I began to think about reasons for the magazine’s response, and I concluded that it is not, as some have argued about Dickey’s standing as a whole, that his work is dimming in contemporary poetic bearing, but that Dickey’s reputation is still ruptured by the “Dickey stories,” as Ward Briggs, the editor for this new edition, termed the controversies in some recent correspondence.</p>
<p>Some might find this conclusion quite obvious, even naïve, but I was introduced to Dickey’s poetry merely seventeen years ago in Leon Stokesbury’s 1996 <em>The Made Thing</em>, an anthology of contemporary Southern poets. Finding Dickey’s deeply mythic and muscular poetry almost dizzyingly evocative and inspiring, I went on to purchase, in 1998, <em>James Dickey: The Selected Poems</em> (Wesleyan Poetry Series), edited by Robert Kirschten. This edition now sits on my shelf, like so many of my books of Dickey’s poetry and scholarship about Dickey’s poetry, nearly destroyed from repeated rereadings. Because of my relatively recent exposure to his poetry, my love of Dickey’s work is blessedly devoid of any personal anecdotes from the bank of Dickey antics that seem to preclude more than a few editors and poets from acknowledging the significance and power of his work. Undoubtedly Dickey’s poetry is inconsistent: the later work is difficult, even opaque at times, but reveals Dickey’s refusal to stagnate stylistically and to push his imagination into new territories, even if some of these aspirations leave all but the most vehement of his devotees behind.</p>
<p>Nor is it a secret that Dickey could be a difficult person; indeed, entire books exist to focus on—or at least heavily depend on—Dickey’s behavior, some of which seem well-written and fair, while others seem intentionally destructive. Indeed, the pre-publication commentary, or blurbs, on the back cover of <em>The Complete Poems of James Dickey,</em> qualify their statements (rightfully) by mentioning this aspect of Dickey’s life: Joyce Carol Oates, writes, for instance, that “[Dickey] cannot be reproached for the fact that some of these aspects of a vast, complex self are at war with the others”; Stanley Plumly posits that “sometimes the man, in his drive for fame, seemed to get in the way of the poet.”  Thankfully, <em>The Complete Poems of James Dickey</em> reveals just how powerful a force Dickey’s work—particularly poems written from the 1950s through the 1970s—remains in contemporary poetry, the relevance of his power to a great many poets, Southern and otherwise.</p>
<p>So why care about <em>The Complete Poems of James Dickey</em> in all its six pounds of heft? Because, indeed, it is much more than Dickey’s entire poetic oeuvre, though the poems are the book’s center. It is not hyperbole to state that this volume represents for me a new editorial standard against which I will compare my own editions. For any scholar or reader of Dickey’s poetry, this book handily overwhelms antecedent editions in its sheer abundance of information about the work. In addition to the prefatory matter—the foreword by Richard Howard (characteristically lucid and informative), a preface, acknowledgements, and a very helpful introduction by editor Ward Briggs—an owner of this edition comes into possession of the massive and useful Apparatus Criticus of nearly two hundred pages, which includes<br />
•    abbreviations<br />
•    a comprehensive list of anthologies that reprinted Dickey’s poetry<br />
•    a list of previous appearances of each poem, specifically (a), the first publication of eachpoem; (b) where each poem was collected; (c) often expansive contextual notes; (d) where each poem was reprinted; and (e), any extant textual variants of the poems.</p>
<p>Moreover, this book boasts comprehensive indexes to help the reader locate anything quickly, a major correction to the conspicuous omission in <em>The Whole Motion: The Collected Poems, 1945-1992</em> (Wesleyan, 1992). These include<br />
•    an index of titles<br />
•    an index of first lines<br />
•    an index of names in the Apparatus Criticus<br />
Most important is the addition of forty poems not included in <em>The Whole Motion</em>, supplying Dickey readers and scholars alike with a refined and complete understanding of Dickey’s poetic accomplishment. Finally, this edition corrects approximately fifty typographical errors in <em>The Whole Motion</em>—a typo in every five poems or so—making this edition not only complete, but substantively superior in rendering the poems as Dickey wanted them to be.</p>
<p>This review would feel incomplete if I did not acknowledge the design and quality of the tangible product itself. At nearly $80, the book is not inexpensive, but the quality wholly reflects the investment. The book is hardbound, with luscious paper and a beautiful matte dustcover, and the cover image is both striking and beautiful: a relatively early photograph of Dickey, taken by Timothy Galfas, courtesy of James Dickey Papers, Manuscripts, Archives, and Rare Book Library of Emory University, overlaid with a facsimile of Dickey’s voluptuous signature, courtesy of Thomas Cooper Special Collections at the University of South Carolina. Special mention should be made of the printer, as well, as even the integral black space that follows the first section of the long poem Apollo is implemented to great effect, replicating the idiosyncratic and breathless feeling of the poem’s “moon-dark pulling.”</p>
<p>In sum, Ward Briggs has brought to readers his labor amoris, a “partial payment,” he writes in the preface, for his thirty-year friendship with Dickey. Here readers are privy not merely to the poetry but to the biographical and historical contexts of the poems. Dickey’s best work, poems as variegated as “The Vegetable King,” “The Heaven of Animals,” “Cherrylog Road,” “The Last Wolverine,” and “Falling,” just to name a few, are revivified by Briggs’ love for his subject. The poems demand, as ever, acknowledgement that Dickey, no matter the stories that orbit his reputation, will remain a significant force in the poetry of the American South and in American letters in general. Fortunately, this essential text ensures that succeeding generations of readers and poets will come to know this extraordinary work without the freight of irrelevant controversy.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/631/files/2013/08/Melancholy-wrig.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-448" alt="Melancholy wrig" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/631/files/2013/08/Melancholy-wrig.jpeg" width="122" height="185" /></a>American poetry is an amorphous entity, ever-shifting, uncontainably vast. Frankly, as in any era, in any place, there is good poetry, and there is bad. I will not run the risk of berating contemporary writers whose popularity (I feel) derives from almost anything besides talent, much less giftedness, whose work seems, if not befuddling, incoherent, or just poorly written, then damningly clever, calculatedly edgy, or simply condescending, perpetuating the notion that poetry is a wholly Delphic enterprise, a series of codes meant for a very select few to decipher. The landscape of poetry needs diversity, of course, it needs its different textures, but currently (and this is admittedly attributable to my own biases; we all have them) there is a lot of poetry that seems written to confuse. Fortunately, there are just as many poets whose work restores, whose writing is lucid, accessible, and, simply put, beautiful. Robert Wrigley is one of these poets.</p>
<p>With eight previous collections of poems, most recently <em>Beautiful Country</em> and <em>Earthly Meditations: New and Selected Poems</em>, Wrigley has firmly established himself as a major American poet, a writer keen to the Earth’s rhythms and how human pulses correspond—sometimes harmoniously, sometimes not—with these rhythms. Wrigley is not an overtly ecological or nature poet, for these terms are reductive and dismissive for one of such skill and thematic diversity. Indeed, <em>Anatomy of Melancholy</em> proves Wrigley’s most diverse effort thus far, a book almost disorienting in its variation—there are poems, for example, about repairing a tree, the ghost of Philip Larkin at a carhop, Anna Karenina, boots, King Kong, and more. However, non-human nature has almost always served as the imagistic and metaphorical heart from which Wrigley’s work springs, and <em>Anatomy of Melancholy</em> remains consistent in the use of these motifs, a poetry made powerful for doing so, promising nurturance of both intellect and heart, and, of course, in the end, revealing much about the most complicated of organic life—the human being.</p>
<p><em>Anatomy of Melancholy</em> is an apt title, Wrigley’s exploration of the “blue” side of our personalities and an elegiac celebration of the myriad melancholic aspects of life, but his poetry never acquiesces to the lachrymose or lugubrious. Indeed, much of the work is quite humorous For instance, “For I Will Consider My Cat Lenore” is a loving and wry tribute to Wrigley’s pet, a poem dappled with syntax and diction derived from Christopher Smart’s “For I Will Consider My Cat Jeoffry” (from his “Jubilate Agno”); like Smart’s deeply comical and spiritual piece, Wrigley’s consideration of his cat is rhetorically delightful and imaginative, fittingly catlike. Usually, though, Wrigley’s poems vacillate between plainspoken observations and highly lyrical, sonically charged narratives. In the book’s first poem, “Triage,” a plangent and ecological narrative on mortality, Wrigley’s dynamic language rushes down the page like a creek after rain:<br />
Scarred by a long-gone buck’s rubbing,<br />
shoved westward by his develveting grind,<br />
the aspen has always leaned, and I had thought<br />
many times I should stake it up, straighten it out,</p>
<p>but I never did. Then last week’s several heavy<br />
feet of snow became rain, and under that weight is split<br />
at the buck’s scar and bent to the ground,<br />
and I was bereft. But in my regret I hauled</p>
<p>through the snow a hundred feet of ropes,<br />
a come-along, a pair of steel pintle hooks. . .</p>
<p>Wrigley’s conflations of wilderness and the human self reveal genuine empathy for the interiorities of the world outside his way of knowing, evidenced by inquiries in the evocative “Bovinity”:<br />
. . . Perhaps the cowbird is no bird<br />
at all, but the dream, and the dream is flying.<br />
And what of me then? Even in its sleep<br />
it may be aware of the presence of the maker</p>
<p>of fences, bringer of the gun, conjurer<br />
of the high-backed truck and the hunchbacked<br />
butcher, builder of the gut pile the ravens<br />
and magpies will celebrate. . .<br />
“Friendly Fire” reveals a speaker entrenched in familial memory, a long narrative about tensions with the narrator’s father, and how two songs recall those tensions and lead, eventually, to bittersweet reconciliation, even as “scar tissue isn’t visible on the psyche’s skin.”</p>
<p>Wrigley’s poems can sometimes hiss and crackle with a nearly Saxon hardness, as in the first stanza of “Now Here”:<br />
The current turns a shoaly lace of pebbles<br />
in the shallows. They rattle tick and tack<br />
and ring; they sing hosanna to the afterlife of sand.<br />
Sun off a smolt in the kingfisher’s beak<br />
is a jewel its wings can live by. Its eye’s black<br />
and wary before it’s gone. Runoff rubble<br />
holds a ribcage against a rock.<br />
Such poems recall Roethke, Richard Hugo, Hopkins, and Dylan Thomas, powerfully lyrical and rich.</p>
<p>Conversely, poems such as “Careers,” equally as powerful, depend less on onomatopoeia and musicality and more on a tonally reserved storytelling, less on the natural world and more on human memory and behavior. These poems are no less resonant. Indeed, “Careers” positioned at the heart of the book, is such a special piece that I will not quote it here in fear that its loveliness will be partially lost to those first encountering it.</p>
<p><em>Anatomy of Melancholy</em> is a book best read a little at a time, for the poems are almost kaleidoscopic in array and tenor, and the words are best savored in increments, even as the book boasts a most beautiful symmetrical arc (as the last poem, “To Autumn,” solidifies). Yet Wrigley’s poetry plays so actively in the mind that interstitial silence between all this music will not subdue the overall effect and might help amplify it. There’s much to love here, and the book’s leverage, its many themes and approaches, as well as its wide-ranging rhetorical textures, welcomes contemplation and multiple readings. “Stop and Listen,” which appears later in the book, delights in this very idea. Set in second person, the narrator recognizes how “sometimes the woods at night are so still / the sound of your own breath / abashes you, to say nothing / of the racket as you walk.” The poem is the story of epiphanic recognition; it is the narrative of attentiveness that leads to yearning for vision and the vision itself, a revelation that paradoxically unifies and separates. In order to be part of the “world’s greater silence,” to travel with the earth and to listen to it requires acknowledgment that one possesses everything and is distinct from all possessions. One is part of the human world, and yet the human world—to the contemplative, the silent listeners—always seems slightly alien, a case of <em>jamais vu</em> in which the familiar both isolates and “illumines.” The result of such knowing is perhaps one of our most beautiful sadnesses, a plangent gift, and Wrigley’s <em>The Anatomy of Melancholy</em> helps us come closer to understanding how such sadness can endow us with rarest joy.</p>
