<p>From the window you can see which trees I mean.<br />
I used to have a view for twenty acres<br />
of pine and poplar woods, a cattle pasture<br />
where I’d see mother foxes with their kits.</p>
<p>Now, only these dozen trees divide me<br />
from townhouses sprouting from the hills.<br />
Rotten to the root, they won’t survive,<br />
their branches webbed with fat silk-moth cocoons.</p>
<p>When I called Pro Arbor Tree Service in Reston,<br />
an agent asked to take my information<br />
and told me he could send a crew next Tuesday.<br />
I hung up without leaving my number.</p>
<p>I’m glad I thought of you and glad you came.<br />
With my bursitis, I can’t do much these days.<br />
Strong enough last week to tug the pullcord<br />
of my saw, I walked across the woodyard,</p>
<p>and breathed the blue fumes the chainsaw belched,<br />
listening to it shriek as I touched the teeth<br />
to the sickliest tree.  I had to stop myself.<br />
I wasn’t up to it.  But now you’re here.</p>
<p>Take the woodshed keys.  The saw’s gassed up.<br />
I see you brought your old Dodge Power Wagon.<br />
Haul all the wood you need.  I don’t want money.<br />
Just leave a quarter cord behind for me.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What would April do?  Tease hidden<br />
meanings from the bulbs, raise the stakes<br />
and double my entendres, and bet<br />
all my roses on the bottom line.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s the season of embarrassed trees,<br />
the modest charms of leaf-rot and briar<br />
and hawk-scat thawing on the muddy path:<br />
skinny March at an earnest latitude.</p>
<p>So tell me, Muse:  where around here might a woman<br />
find a little flint and tinder,<br />
some figure of feisty speech, a correlative for kisses<br />
that would make a grown man weep if she put it<br />
all on the table and headed out<br />
for good into the long-stemmed rain?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Arkansas the red-wings<br />
go down, nearly two thousand<br />
slapped out of the night.<br />
Beaks pointed, wings drawn<br />
to their sides as men shot<br />
from cannons, they land unseen,<br />
on their sides, like pepper<br />
shook out on a small Southern snow.<br />
They fall in a scene now cut<br />
from the movie.  They fall<br />
together with a noise mistaken<br />
for gunfire, or soundless<br />
as dust falls, one to the ground<br />
at a time.  One burrows up<br />
from the earth.  Like a stone<br />
from a sling one kills a deer<br />
with a crack to the head.  When<br />
they are poisoned or struck<br />
or sucked whole through<br />
the props of a low flying plane,<br />
when they cramp, when wind<br />
ices their sails or God<br />
licks them with lightning<br />
they fall.  They fall from great<br />
heights, not as Icarus fell,<br />
flailing, but they duck<br />
into the dive and go down<br />
as though grateful, or,<br />
some say, they fell upright<br />
like jumpers whose chutes<br />
wouldn’t open, feet first<br />
toward accordion crush.<br />
Not every faller makes<br />
for the grass but some<br />
plunge into the false skies<br />
of blue cars, some are<br />
delivered to doorsteps<br />
like badly thrown papers.<br />
Before you wake up<br />
some are dog-gotten or swept<br />
downstream like small<br />
ships, one lands in a nest,<br />
one is not dead but crawls<br />
into the hand of a man<br />
dressed in orange.  While<br />
you sip coffee and news<br />
of air travels over the ground,<br />
an enemy folds one into your bed.<br />
Most are gone by noon. Some<br />
were never there.  Wherever<br />
they go to, they stay.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>circa 1960</p>
<p>Now girls, look carefully<br />
at your embroidery stitches.</p>
<p>Blind stitch or hem stitch.<br />
Back stitch or chain stitch.<br />
Don’t forget whip stitch.<br />
And French Knots.</p>
<p>A good stitch reveals<br />
a wife’s  character.</p>
<p>But what if I did not want<br />
to be wife?  To spend nights bending over<br />
a story of ever more winding and<br />
blossoming foliage?</p>
<p>This looks like running<br />
stitch.  Why all the hurry?</p>
<p>When will this lesson<br />
ever be over? Its hoop cast<br />
aside on the table<br />
or turned in for judgment?</p>
<p>Last of all, look at the underside.<br />
What do you see?</p>
<p>I see the violets now<br />
become unrecognizable.<br />
The bluebirds, the inexorable<br />
bluebirds of happiness snarled.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We used to steal roses.<br />
Not to mention the usual zinnias and batchelor buttons.<br />
We stashed them in woodpecker holes,<br />
arranged them in cowpies.  Dinner’s served,<br />
we announced to the cud-chewers.</p>
<p>The old women scolded us. No blossoms left<br />
for the numerous vases they locked in their cupboards.<br />
But we knew their lantana always came back.<br />
And the elephant ears. Azaleas in early spring.<br />
Deep south, our spring always came early,<br />
earlier now that the wet shawls of air droop<br />
above us like clematis, the climate gone wandering.<br />
Gone  lollygagging,  as we liked to say of ourselves.</p>
<p>I still hate magnolias, their sickly sweet woundedness.<br />
their bruises like those on my arms after falling from bikes<br />
or my roller-skates.  So clumsy, they tut-tutted,<br />
the old women who stayed inside.<br />
Shuttered come mid-afternoon.</p>
<p>We had no fountains in our yards,<br />
no Grecian-nosed goddesses endlessly pouring  libations.<br />
We had buckets and hoses.<br />
We muddied through coleus<br />
and cabbages, snapped off the beans, stuffed them into<br />
our pockets if we had forgotten a sack.<br />
We  expected no laurels,<br />
nor wanted to be the next girl to walk down<br />
the aisle, her bodice too tight, her eyes wide with terror.</p>
<p>We knew our place.<br />
We knew how to hoist a load,<br />
lug a watering pot.<br />
The mud squished between our stubbed toes<br />
that could never have been Aphrodite’s.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A gray leaf enshrouds the earth.<br />
I think of how the rain shifts eastward<br />
into Carolina, how the clouds siphon highways</p>
<p>of any least shadow. Where is my father but on the moss-<br />
ridden hill of his yard, the leaves still clinging<br />
to summer’s last pulse? Where is my mother</p>
<p>but caught in her panic, the foothills<br />
of north Georgia crashing into each other<br />
with a slowness that belies the season’s contrition,</p>
<p>to destroy the green summer always commands?<br />
Beneath us, the earth roils; smoke plumes<br />
from sea-depths where soft, pale creatures,</p>
<p>forever severed of color and light, click, stumble<br />
to find some solace in all that dark.</p>

<p>—in memory of Patricia Highsmith’s “Oona”</p>
<p>In the country of windfall apples<br />
and chicory stubble, the blue glow<br />
of hidden things molded by every fall,</p>
<p>a man left his wife, his Nora,<br />
and when she smiled, her mouth<br />
was like a squat fork lacking the two central tines,</p>
<p>a gap in her upper teeth that gave<br />
her family misery away.<br />
Woman of fraught days, dying fields.</p>
<p>She wrapped her hair in a dry,<br />
coppery bun. Soon, the other men<br />
of that country, who had watched her</p>
<p>for a long time, moved in on her,<br />
for they had always detected something<br />
sensual in the way she threshed</p>
<p>the grass, her stare sharp, locked,<br />
a look that told them her heart<br />
was wan with indifference, compliance.</p>
<p>They heard her say in dreams they never<br />
remembered: Come and touch<br />
the dark spaces, come and stave</p>
<p>my grief for which there is no cure.<br />
One man fixed her rusted well,<br />
one built her a gambrel barn,</p>
<p>and still another fetched<br />
her the best shoat he could find<br />
in three counties. A few brought</p>
<p>flowers, candy, tins of sweetbread.<br />
Soon they offered nothing,<br />
for she smiled at them all the same, let them</p>
<p>stick their tongues and fingers<br />
in that hollow gap without the least<br />
resistance. Nora’s belly never grew,</p>
<p>though gossip swelled, churned,<br />
as gossip will: Even old men,<br />
mostly silent, gathered</p>
<p>to gum their tobacco on<br />
moth-freighted porches at nightfall<br />
to tell what they had heard,</p>
<p>scandal igniting the long-dim heartwood<br />
of their minds. The other women<br />
of that country, growing</p>
<p>bitter, hateful, spat her name,<br />
snarled at the far meadow<br />
where she bent with work.</p>
<p>Hated the ease with which their men slid<br />
into her exhaustion, the ease<br />
with which the days stitched together.</p>
<p>Nights, these women did not<br />
dream of the one who forsook Nora,<br />
how he stopped to witness</p>
<p>the wild furnaces of moonflowers<br />
burn, to catch the stretched, pineal heads<br />
of poplars grown heavy and bowed</p>
<p>with storm. How the seams<br />
between branches revealed<br />
nothing save distant fires that gave</p>
<p>no light. They knew nothing of how he went on,<br />
away from that country, withdrew into dark<br />
between white and laughing leaves.</p>

<p>The mill’s non-stop noise, a whir and a clangor,<br />
follows him home, over the bridge and up<br />
the hill, while at his back it goes on wheezing,<br />
chuffing lint through manifold windows,</p>
<p>into the village with the lunch bucket knocking<br />
at his knee, to bounce a kid on his knee<br />
in the sunlit parlor of the four-room cottage<br />
identical to the one next door, beside</p>
<p>the river that powers the turbines. The privy’s<br />
sulfurous stench stretches to the porch while<br />
his own open windows pass heat and flies<br />
and rugrats flap through the sprung screen door.</p>
<p>A rung up from the tenant shack, maybe two<br />
from a hovel on the Rhine, a hut on the Liffey,<br />
the Mersey, the Volga, he is equal now<br />
to the terrace-house bloke in Wigan,</p>
<p>to his next-century brother in Coimbatore,<br />
or the one in a cinder-block flat in Nantong<br />
perched above the Yangtze, whose mill tunes<br />
its waters daily to the color it’s dyeing—</p>
<p>red, blue, purple—through a little trap door.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This time, the boy had gone missing<br />
for so many hours that a television crew was sent<br />
to cover the story, which is how I came to hear<br />
one lifeguard explain to the camera<br />
that a lost child will usually start walking<br />
along the shoreline in the direction of the sun.</p>
<p>I remember taking this bit<br />
of lifeguard wisdom as a vaguely hopeful sign,<br />
not just because it was a safer choice<br />
than heading shakily into the pounding surf<br />
or inland into the parking lot and the traffic beyond—<br />
but something about the power of the sun and the bravery of children.</p>
<p>That’s when I began to picture many lost children,<br />
a long single-file parade of them,<br />
walking slowly over the wet sand toward the lowering sun—<br />
the brightest, shiniest thing we’ll ever know—<br />
before that moment when their parents turned<br />
to each other, faces locked on the shock of the absence.</p>
<p>I could see each boy or girl on its journey<br />
toward the light burning above the horizon,<br />
hundreds of little explorers striking out<br />
into uncharted territory with nothing but a sunhat maybe<br />
or a useless pail and shovel—<br />
Lewis without Clark, Clark with no Lewis.</p>
<p>But I could not see far enough to tell<br />
if all were found and returned safe in the end<br />
or if they were devoured by the sun<br />
like a scene in a terrifying myth,<br />
for by that time I was walking right behind them,<br />
blinded by the glare of whatever it was they were seeking.</p>

<p>Long ago, a black-headed boy slung<br />
his mail order rifle over one rangy shoulder,<br />
withdrew from the world, unnoticed.<br />
His footfalls entered damp woods<br />
at the edge of town; hush of wet leaves<br />
receiving – at once Indian, silent<br />
in soft leather, and rabbit, velvet ears tuned.<br />
Mist filtered through black branches<br />
cloaked him.</p>
<p>Can I tell you his vision?<br />
A clearing and an oak on fire,<br />
flaming sword pointing skyward,</p>
<p>the weight of a thousand butterflies<br />
drying their bittersweet wings.</p>
