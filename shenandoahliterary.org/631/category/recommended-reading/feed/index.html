								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What a pleasure it’s been to spend time with Kay Byer’s volume of meditative poems and find there a poetry that is profound but that resists the temptation to flaunt all of the effort it took to be that way.  These poems reveal their power not through linguistic pyrotechnics or thematic novelty but, rather, by risking honesty without stumbling over the ledge of sentimentality.</p>
<p>Byer has tied the volume’s three sections together in a narrative arc that considers family and loss, the struggle of white Southerners of a certain age to come to terms with the racism sewn into the fabric of their childhoods, and the wisdom available to those who continue into middle age reflecting upon the currents of love and resistance that battle in memory for a lifetime.  The thematic ties of the three sections are punctuated by recurring declarations of identity.  In the first section’s “Lost,” a poem dedicated to a young girl who appears to be the poet’s aunt and namesake, a dying child negotiates with God, “yearning / to say Here I am / but am not.”  In “Southern Fictions,” the middle section’s sonnet sequence confronting identity and race, a black girl calls out “Here I am” to announce from outside the house her arrival to clean as the family’s father broods over his failure to protest the abuse of black residents by local white bullies.  “First Presbyterian,” a poem appearing early in the volume’s final section, picks up on an earlier poem’s theological skepticism and ends “. . . Just As I Am, we sang, closing the service. / My soul took a deep breath and walked out.” Finally, in “Here,” the volume’s last poem, the speaker reflects on the arc of her life:  “. . . Over thirty years I’ve watched the way / light begins here. It still wakes me up. Lets me be. / Here. Where I am.”</p>
<p>Readers will return more than once to “Southern Fictions,” the book’s most powerful poem. Here, Byer displays in form and content the tensions between cherishing a place and regretting its history, between love of family and disappointment in their subtle complicity in injustice.  It is clear that the poet abhors racism, but the poems are sonnets.  Through their form and subtle music they exhibit tenderness as well as outrage.</p>
<p>Poems of reflection upon family, death, race, and identity are too often assigned these days to the shelf labeled “regional,” but only a narrow reading would suggest that the poems in <em>Descent</em> are parochial. Rather, they are well-crafted leanings into the universal concerns of family, place, and the continuing struggle to see oneself in the “other.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Terrified and fanatical, the characters in <em>Under the Red Flag</em> run amok. In his collection of short stories, Ha Jin depicts the calamity of mass hysteria, which fueled the delirium in Mao-China’s Cultural Revolution. As a teenager, Jin joined the People’s Liberation Army at the height of the radical chaos, a period when neighbors, friends, and even family turned on each other in paranoid frenzy to show dedication to Mao’s campaign for cultural upheaval. Although this was a time of harrowing confusion, Jin’s prose does not embellish. He maintains a straight-forward narrative. The bluntness of which may cause readers to glide through passages describing acts as gruesome as gang rape and decapitation as if they were depictions of landscape. &#8220;In Broad Daylight,&#8221; the opening story, is a proper representative of this style. As a woman is publicly humiliated for sexual liaisons, her supposed cuckold of a husband kills himself. Ha Jin writes, &#8220;The dead man was Meng Su. A crowd had gathered at the railroad two hundred yards east of the station house. A few men were examining the rail that was stained with blood and studded with bits of flesh. One man paced along the darker part of the rail and announced that the train had dragged Meng at least seventy feet.&#8221; The most sinister stories, however, ironically end with the protagonist receiving a windfall. One of these is “Winds and Clouds over a Funeral,” where an oath to a dying grandmother is overlooked in order to serve the Chinese Communist Party. Through dizzying manipulation and a touch of magical luck, this event turns the disobedient son into the vice-magistrate of his village. The grandson, whose guilt until that point overwhelmed him, flushes all shame away as he considers that now he may have his pick of the “prettiest girl[s] of the factory.”</p>
<p>It was only fifty years ago that the Cultural Revolution enveloped China in complete disorder. Yet, there is relatively little literature that explores this strange time experienced by at least 185 million people living today. Jin’s stories delineate the most inspired and desperate survival tactics, and yet they all retain a sense of humanity. In &#8220;Taking a Husband,&#8221; a new bride hides herself in a freezing well to escape the debasing attack on her wedding banquet by the local Red Guard, whose leader is a scorned ex-suitor. In “The Richest Man,” a stingy doctor is resented by everyone in the village due to his material wealth. With ferocious ease, the villagers are able to fabricate reasons to publicly denounce and punish him, although the accusations are as insubstantial as the broken button they present as evidence to his misdeeds. The last story, &#8220;A Decade,&#8221; is narrated by a former student as she laments the calumny of her once beautiful teacher, who was forced into hard labor, and is now as spiteful as everyone else. Jin’s ability in impartial but powerful story-telling is demonstrated through his efficient pacing. The Flannery O’Connor Award for this book is justly deserved as he describes the horrific and banal in the same tone. For example, as a child, nicknamed &#8220;Grandson,&#8221; is brutally beaten by Party officers in “Emperor,” Jin does not dwell in dramatics. &#8220;We all followed them to see what would happen to him, while the latrine cleaners laughed with their heads thrown back, pointing at Grandson, who was kicking in the air. Then they shouldered their loads of night soil and set out for Elm Village, where they lived. One of them carried two empty buckets with his pole.&#8221; Similar to O’Connor’s style, the deaths, terror, and torture are abrupt and unceremonious. Ha Jin’s <em>Under the Red Flag</em> translates both the stoicism and silent sorrow of the Cultural Revolution&#8217;s survivors.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/631/files/2013/08/hollow-bone.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-450" alt="hollow bone" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/631/files/2013/08/hollow-bone.jpeg" width="306" height="200" srcset="https://shenandoahliterary.org/631/files/2013/08/hollow-bone.jpeg 306w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/631/files/2013/08/hollow-bone-300x196.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 306px) 100vw, 306px" /></a>Jack B. Bedell’s <em>Bone-Hollow, True: New &amp; Selected Poems</em> marks a mid-career milestone for a poet that’s helped define Louisiana’s contemporary poetry, as well as Southern poetry in general. Divided into four sections—New Poems, Call and Response, Come Rain, Come Shine, and At the Bonehouse—the book centers on the well-known Southern motifs: landscape, family, and identity, but Bedell’s work, as evidenced in this generous selection, paradoxically transcends the parochialism of these thematic trappings through sheer skill; his pacing, imagistic texture, and gothic acknowledgments of mortality illuminate these accessible and memorable poems.</p>
<p>Certainly, in a poem such as “Travail,” Bedell even denies one of the central Southern images that still haunt many poems from the region:<br />
Handling serpents doesn’t impress me.<br />
I’ve done it too often to feel any real breath<br />
on my neck from the act. I’ve come home<br />
too many spring mornings from the marsh<br />
at the back of my neighborhood with a pillow case<br />
full of snakes snatched from the water’s edge. . .<br />
And while there’s “no real trial to serpents . . . pulsing in the boards of some old church,” the speaker does fear the “row or Mason jars full of strychnine. . . lined up on the altar,” another test that involves “pain and grace.” Indeed, it is this pain and grace duality that informs much of the book: the grace of a bird of prey, but the pain it brings to the creatures it hunts (including, metaphorically, the poet); the grace of being with a wife, but the pain of touring with her a prison museum, haunted by death.</p>
<p>Bedell also excels in his ekphrastic pieces about Monet and Matisse and Henri Cartier-Bresson, revealing his range, but the book’s crux thrives in its “pain and grace” motifs, particularly those centered in Bedell’s Louisiana. Two poems stand out: “A Barn in Arnaudville” and “L’avalasse.” The former poem brews with strangeness, a mixture of “pain” (the “storm brewing overhead,” the “straining”) and “grace,” the painterly beauty of the distant workers, the communal stirrings of the trees and grasses, and the eerie interior of the barn that nonetheless channels hope.</p>
<p>“L’avalasse” is perhaps my favorite of <em>Bone-Hollow, True</em>, a brief poem of fabled resonance and nuance. Old women of the parish walk out into rain “in their nightgowns as soon as the bullfrogs / stiffen in the ditch and hunker down, / believing the water will cleanse them of their aches / and lighten the weight their years have built.” The ghostly presence of the old women gives way to the spiritual, the Biblical: “Somewhere, the old women are bathing, / their lesson in water coming down— / now matter how it pounds, this rain / will not outlast Noah’s. Our land is thirstier than his, our sins / much easier to wash away.” Brightly evocative, spectral, seamless in its narrative movement, “L’avalasse” represents Bedell at his best, with celebrations of identity, local culture, religiosity, and landscape.</p>
<p>I’ve often thought that much of the poetry of the Pelican State centers on the images of water and fecundity, and it is perhaps Bedell’s poetry that most effectively explores these ideas in ways personal and relatable. Bone-Hollow, True relumes Louisiana into a mythic place, allows readers to live and love there, to glimpse an understanding of Bedell’s family, his highly complicated landscape, and the intense beauty of both, born of destruction, community, faith.</p>

Harlow begins with following paragraph:<br />
It was dark. The boy lay down in a swale and rolled the flannel shirt he had been wearing into a cigarette shaped pillow and placed it under his head. He closed his eyes and tried to sleep as the crickets played a steady hum in the woods around him. A car occasionally drove over the gravelroad beyond him, throwing rocks and dirt down and over near the ditchbank where the boy lay shivering now, the red clay loosening from the embankment and powdering the boy’s clothes and skin a strange ocher. He tucked his knees into his chest and rubbed his cheek against the warm flannel and looked peripherally at the winter sky overhead. Each white star and the full white moon seemed holes punched into the myriad blackness surrounding everything: the only thing darker—more black—the pine trees jutting from the ground like crooked black teeth against the cold and hollow mouth of the sky behind them.</p>
<p>Armand’s introduction reflects his deftness with sensorial textures and a style that recalls Faulkner, a linguistic breadth that compels readers to slow down and relish the language. Indeed, the book’s tone is headlong and highly lyrical, akin to Cormac McCarthy’s novels <em>Outer Dark </em>and<em> Child of God</em> or William Gay’s <em>Provinces of Night</em>. These influences are also notable in Armand’s technique and language: He eschews quotation marks in dialogue, often creates portmanteaus, and his sentences are usually serpentine, abundant, and elegant, teeming with idiosyncratic though effectual diction such as “vermiculate,” “lugubriously,” and “vanquished.”  Paradoxically, most of the action in Harlow is quick and harrowing, adding complexity to Armand’s approach: the language, often intensely rich, fuels the narrative and amplifies a story in which the memories of father and son communicate so strongly and seamlessly that they are often dizzying. The book is brief, but the story has a long half-life.</p>
<p>In Harlow, Armand’s characters are products of extreme familial dysfunction, son and father both must learn to shuck the consequences of past neglect, violence, and ignorance to locate and come to terms with their identity and relationship. And despite the rough world in which they live, and perhaps because of it, both characters are endowed with artistic sensibilities—Leslie, the son, in his sensitive and contemplative reflections on self and wilderness and navigation of memory, and Harlow in a more literal sense, in painting.</p>
<p>In sum, <em>Harlow</em> is a macabre, gothic work but manages to interweave some lightheartedness, particularly in moments when Leslie interacts with a girl with whom he is quickly smitten, Nevaeh, a complex and pivotal character herself. At its heart, though, the novel is preoccupied with the primordial: place, identity, violence, blood-kin, the latter intensified in a moment in which Leslie is acknowledged by his father, who douses him in the blood of a boar after a successful hunt:<br />
The boy feels good, warm with his own blood pulsing through him and the blood of the animal they’ve just hunted and killed on his flesh and his father’s hand on his shoulder now: gripping his son, his own blood, for the first time now and the boy Leslie breathes in the cold air but he is not cold now and he stands in the bottoms, his boots slowly sinking into the mud but the whole time his heart rising in his chest just as the dead and bloodied boar had risen up on that creaking treebranch like something cold now being resurrected form the mire.</p>
<p>Again, what separates a book such as Harlow from the myriad southern novels that straddle the line between popular and literary fiction—and indeed, what makes Harlow undoubtedly literary—is the tonal maximalism, the luxuriating in evocative words and long sentences, the obvious love and care for language. Indeed the dichotomously brusque plot and the highly lyrical execution create a harmony that induces a kind of synesthesia: Reading Harlow feels like biting into a juicy peach freshly plucked from the orchard. It is a delicious read, and fans of writers such as Cormac McCarthy, William Gay, Charles Frazier, and Charles Dodd White will enjoy this book immensely.</p>
