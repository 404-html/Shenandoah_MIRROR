					<description><![CDATA[This story contains an intriguing blend of past, present, and future, one that is made all the more impressive given the length of the piece. Ms. Hollmeyer artfully raises the question of legacy -- the reader is left to ponder what it means to grow old and what happens of our belongings, our memories, and ultimately of ourselves after we&#039;re gone. I found myself viewing Dot as an artifact in her own right; amongst the relics housed in the Ice River History Museum, she carries with her a history that is essentially meaningless to both the daughter and the docent, just as the trinkets do. This lack of significance is more substantial with regard Mary, for her own mother has a past of which she was unable, or perhaps unwilling, to learn more about. By the end of the story, I felt motivated to delve into the shelves of my own home -- hopefully I will be able to unearth some trinkets of my own, ones that will not lose their uniqueness with the passing of time.]]></description>
