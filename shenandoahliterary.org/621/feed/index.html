								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>A Face to Meet the Faces: An Anthology of Contemporary Persona Poetry</em><br />
edited by Stacey Lynn Brown and Oliver de la Paz (Akron, 2012)</p>
<p>by Nick Ripatrazone</p>
<p>Dislocated Identities, Found Personas<br />
Edward Hirsch notes that persona poetry originates “in archaic rituals where masks are independent beings that possess the ones who assume them,” resulting in the animistic “displacement of the poet’s self into another existence, a second self.” Hirsch quotes W.B. Yeats that the poet “never speaks directly as to someone at the breakfast table, there is always a phantasmagoria.” Each poetic or imaginative act is a form of persona, but persona poetry is the acknowledgment of disruption of the self’s shape, like a phantasmagoric, lantern-projected image onto an uneven rock wall.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/10/face-to-meet.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-797" title="face to meet" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/10/face-to-meet.jpeg" alt="" width="172" height="264" /></a>A Face to Meet the Faces</em> offers nearly 500 pages of persona poems arranged by both content and theme. Sections include historical figures, characters from mythology, folklore, popular culture, religious figures, fairy tales and other imaginative literature, as well as adoptions of the voices of poets and fiction writers. The editors have compiled a generous sampling of both established and emerging voices. Blas Falconer documents Diego Salcedo’s 16th century murder that preceded the Taíno rebellion. Tony Trigilio channels Lee Harvey Oswald’s confession to his father. Kazim Ali renews the Icarus myth. Jericho Brown performs as Diana Ross in “Track 4: Reflections.” Cornelius Eady elegizes Emmett Till through the young man’s glass-top casket. Patricia Smith braves the hate of a skinhead who has “my own beauty.” Susan Rich’s midrashic “Sarah’s Story” compliments the treatment of Isaac by William Robert Flowers. Philip Memmer shares a new magician’s assistant hopes to better her predecessors who have worn “the same short sequined dress.”  The collection spans moments of seriousness and absurdity, all glued by the transformative act of persona.</p>
<p>Three particular poems represent the breadth and depth of the collection. John Canaday’s “Robert Oppenheimer Near Los Alamos, October 1945” is a sensitive refiguring of Oppenheimer’s persona. Though the paradoxes of Oppenheimer’s personality are well known, his literary leanings are worthy of further investigation. “Robert Oppenheimer” makes no direct mention of the bomb, but for good reason: it postdates the Trinity test, the August bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and instead returns to Oppenheimer’s self-professed true loves, “physics and desert country.”</p>
<p>The poem is narrated by a group “urging their horses forward, watching ribbons / of steam rise from their flanks.” In the only metaphorical reference to the structures of Los Alamos, “Crises’ steel shoes sang / on the sandstone outcrops.” Moonlight is found “down by the river,” where “the boatman slept in an old alder shack / between two palms.” Though the boatman is unnamed, the postwar context, along with Oppenheimer’s poetic self-awareness of his role in the machinations of death, intimates Charon. Here Canaday revises the language of Oppenheimer’s own poem, “Crossing,” written at Harvard. Oppenheimer’s poetry induced Paul Dirac’s infamous jab: “I understand that you are writing poetry as well as working at physics. I do not see how you can do both. In science we say something that no one knew before in a way that everybody can understand. Whereas in poetry . . . ”</p>
<p>The poems of Oppenheimer and Canaday share content: several men on horseback crossing a river, a moon lost behind mountains. Phrases are nearly replicated: Oppenheimer’s “ranges barring the sky” has become “High slopes / barring the sky.” Yet Canaday’s divergence from Oppenheimer’s original poem creates a successful work of persona. Oppenheimer’s poem was written long before the reality of the Manhattan Project, and could be set anywhere in the Southwest. Canaday’s version is set on the Rio Grande, so that the riders see their boatman in the shadow of the bomb’s development. Oppenheimer’s boatman “called to us”; Canaday’s boatman sleeps. It is the riders, not the boatman, who “called farewell,” and only the “tamarisks replied” with “salty breath” before their “dry leaves . . . flickered like candles / and went out.” A soft ending to a poem about a man instrumental in developing a most dangerous weapon.</p>
<p><em>A Face to Meet the Faces</em> moves beyond refiguring historical personas to contemporary poets adopting past voices. Matthew Nienow’s “Walt Whitman Sings Happy Birthday to Himself” works well. In the preface to the 1855 version of Leaves of Grass, Whitman nearly contemplates such persona attention: “The greatest poet forms the consistence of what is to be from what has been and is. He drags the dead out of their coffins and stands them again on their feet.”</p>
<p>The 25-line poem is one sentence. Commas nudge the narrative forward, but the form never feels convoluted. Nienow resists the urge to elevate Whitman. The poem begins “Down the uneven plank stairs, down to the cellar-world” choked by “thick smoke.” There, “the low rumble of a hundred men” become one, joined by Whitman. They all “have come here, to celebrate / or curse the fact of our being here.” Though Nienow indulges, like Whitman, in “myself,” the personal reflexive is tempered: myself “is also to drink to you / for we are of the same flesh and must sing to say so.” Whitman, after “the long night among other men, smelling / still of smoke and earth,” returns to the now quiet city to “sing myself another year in this lingering body.”</p>
<p>Visitors to Whitman’s 1891 birthday celebration included the painter Thomas Eakins, who, speaking of painting Whitman, said “ordinary methods” were insufficient; “technique, rules, and traditions would have to be thrown aside; that, before all else, he was to be treated as a man.” Whitman’s confidence and voice threatens to burst through Nienow’s own words.</p>
<p>Not bound to the real, <em>A Face to Meet the Faces</em> also offers fictional personas. “Pinocchio’s Elegy for the Unreal” by Ariana-Sophia Kartsonis offers a continuation of Carlo Collodi’s serialized novel. In the novel, still-marionette Pinocchio is chased by assassins, and seeks refuge in the house of a “lovely maiden” who claims she is already dead, simply “waiting for the coffin to take me away.” Once Pinocchio is captured the narrative turns from sardonic to violent: the marionette is lynched, but as an unreal child, death is not possible. Pinocchio is taken down and wrapped in sheets. One of the doctors summoned, the Talking Cricket, calls Pinocchio “a rascal of the worst kind . . . rude, lazy, a runaway,” but he survives.<br />
Collodi’s novel ends with Pinocchio’s strange transformation into a boy: his wooden form is “leaning against a chair, head turned to one side, arms hanging limp, and legs twisted under him.” So the gift of life is one of displacement, the passing away of an old body. Collodi ends the novel abruptly, and the story begs continuation. Kartsonis offers the next act with Collodi’s wit. Geppetto, “who once pulled my strings, / knit the motion to my dance, tied to me / somewhere inside even now” is “deep in the sleep of death.” Now “you’re on your own.”</p>
<p>The speaker misses “the certainty of my ligneous hands” and that a “torn finger can’t be carved anew.” Unfortunately, with humanity comes mortality: “I wish you’d told me about the way it feels / to be watching life from a dying body.” The poem evolves from sarcasm to a concerted lament, as the speaker longs for moments of the unreal, since he “can still hear the toys talk, still hear the whispers / of the inanimate world, the soul of objects.”<br />
The poem ends with a return to Geppetto’s workshop, where “every old tool dreams of your hands, / your smoothing grip.” There, “veiled with cobwebs,” a spider “unlaces a luna moth, a dinner / too huge, too gossamer to be real.” In these final lines, the poem and novel coalesce, reaching another layer of story. Such conversation between poem, precedent, persona, and variations might be the best result of A Face to Meet the Faces, and of the persona act.</p>
<p>Donald Hall finds possible “dangers” in persona poetry, exampling the work of TS Eliot and James Dickey. In “The Self as Agent,” Dickey explains that each poem “is both an exploration and an invention of identity.” All poetry, for Dickey, is fiction, so critics should not expect autobiography or consistency of personality across works. For Dickey, a poet’s worth is synonymous with multiplicity of personality. Persona “gives the poet a chance to confront and dramatize parts of himself that otherwise would not have surfaced.”<br />
Hall posits that Dickey’s usage of persona might be an act of poetic cowardice, saying “we want him to try to find out what it means in his own life.” He finds that Dickey “does not accept the risk of his search . . . Instead, he uses a persona as a way out.” Such criticism might be valid in a particular, political realm, but the act of persona poetry is not the avoidance of the “I,” it is an acceptance and qualification of the “we.” Empathy&#8211;poetic or otherwise&#8211;is not easy, and the dramatic monologues of persona poetry offer valuable experiences for both reader and writer. Distortion of truth and identity is good for the breakfast table, as well as the page.</p>

<p>I am sorry to disturb you so late in the evening.<br />
You see, I&#8217;d forgotten to say what I came for earlier.<br />
It is lovely tonight, isn&#8217;t it?  The soft rushing<br />
of wind through the leaves before they turn<br />
incites the air with misgivings about the season.</p>
<p>I imagine there are as many ways to end a story<br />
as there are to end a day,<br />
with the awaited storm, agitation<br />
that alternately lifts the soul up, then terrifies,<br />
or the slow blue hours of nightfall, coolness<br />
that seems less like something falling on earth<br />
than something taken away.</p>
<p>I never believed in falling in love.<br />
I&#8217;ve known too much of the tyranny of lust.<br />
Yet my hand can scarcely near your wrist<br />
without the trembling of sinews that have caressed ivory keys.<br />
This wave of tenderness strangles the heart.</p>
<p>Surely you must know how I feel.<br />
I give these notes to the voice of another<br />
when always it is what <em>I</em> feel,<br />
your coming close, then drifting away . . . .<br />
Let us walk awhile under the dimming streetlights<br />
in sober introspection.  About these songs,<br />
bodiless words and music speaking to each other.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recommended by William Wright</p>
<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/09/Confederado300px.jpeg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-739" title="Confederado300px" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/09/Confederado300px.jpeg" alt="" width="126" height="192" srcset="https://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/09/Confederado300px.jpeg 300w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/09/Confederado300px-196x300.jpeg 196w" sizes="(max-width: 126px) 100vw, 126px" /></a>Casey Clabough’s first novel, <em>Confederado</em>, is the story of Alvis Benjamin Stevens, a confederate soldier of central Virginia who returns home four months after the official conclusion of the American Civil War to find the context of his landscape, family and town, as well as the stability of his memories, irrevocably altered by what the war has wrought upon them. After igniting enmity among a group of union soldiers within town and escaping narrowly via deft horsemanship and the advice of a woodsmen and a wealthy uncle, Alvis comes to understand he will have to leave his wrecked home for Brazil, where Lavinia, the intelligent and beautiful girl he courted before the war, has fled before him.</p>
<p>After accepting the need to abandon a home he can no longer recognize as his own, Alvis travels through raucous weathers and is literally wrecked and deposited upon the sands of Brazil, finding there a world completely alien to him, where, after living with several idiosyncratic locals and engaging in battles equal to and perhaps more harrowing than those he survived in his homeland, he persists, adapts and, ultimately, prevails. In Clabough’s hands, the story proves kinetic, exciting, and perhaps most importantly, textured with a giftedness that makes <em>Confederado</em> more than an adventure tale: It is genuine literature, allowing its reader to live with and within its protagonist. Relying equally on the complex interiorities of Alvis and the exteriorities of diverse landscapes in which the story takes place, <em>Confederado</em> bears resemblance to the best historical fiction of writers such as Robert Morgan and Ron Rash.</p>
<p>This success is due to Clabough’s muscular handling of narrative: the book’s tone is stately, measured, imbued with fecund language and well-executed and historically accurate dialog. The momentum of the story vacillates between pace and gallop (indeed, Clabough’s love of horses, landscape, and farming are made nearly palpable in this novel), but the swiftness of the story’s movement is not episodic; instead, it is cumulative, authentic, creating a work both vast and intimate. Even in the relatively contemplative, languorous moments in the novel, Clabough’s language is more than merely metaphorically taut, but brisk, sonically textured, often achieving the concentrated dynamism of poetry. In the following passage, for example, Alvis’s re-imagines his home’s landscape despite its war-ravaged wildness:</p>
<p>Alvis . . . took long a long circuitous walk about the farm as mottled clouds drifted eastward overhead, filtering in the sunlight of late afternoon. He paused in the midst of his return beneath a great sycamore on a hillside overlooking the surrounding terrain. The whiteness of the house shone in the bottom against the green fields and weathered gray chestnut boards of the outbuildings. The fields had been neglected during the war and stood covered in weeds, sumac, and saplings, but Alvis, recalling all his father had taught him, could imagine how they would appear when he worked them again: how the furrows would open with a dark purple hue in the creek bottom while irregular shades of hard red clay would line the hillsides.</p>
<p>Alvis’s love of trees transcends their utility, the narrator tells us; his admiration includes, also, “the manner by which they spoke of the seasons through the shifting colors of leaves and the rushing and receding of sap.”</p>
<p>Indeed, all of <em>Confederado</em> is about revising one’s life, changing one’s inner and outer landscape to survive inevitable obstacles, even death. It is about indentifying home and acknowledging its changeability, how to adapt to and reshape it, while never losing sight of one’s central goal. Thus, despite its tragic landscapes and characters, <em>Confederado</em> is a heroic tale, one worth reading more than once for its muscular, authentic, and exciting textures.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recommended by Sarah Kennedy</p>
<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/08/bringup.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-647" title="bringup" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/08/bringup.jpeg" alt="" width="132" height="198" /></a>If you love the Tudors, you will probably like Hilary Mantel’s <em>Bring up the Bodies</em>. The sequel to her <em>Wolf Hall</em>, the book continues the story of Henry VIII’s secretary Thomas Cromwell. Mantel now focuses on the fall of Anne Boleyn, and though this story is well known, she hopes to make it new by using Cromwell as her main character.</p>
<p>Mantel has been criticized before for disregarding period diction in her historical novels, especially in her dialogue, and the writing in <em>Bring up the Bodies </em>is no exception. Although she sprinkles in a few Renaissancey-sounding terms like “kinsman” and “napery,” the writing, for the most part, uses the same expressions and locutions that she used in <em>A Place of Greater Safety</em>, her novel about the French Revolution. The language in all these novels is not much different than what you would expect to find in a contemporary work of fiction. Characters refer to liquidating assets; someone’s time at court is called a “tour of duty.” Sometimes, too, her metaphors get a little out of control, as when an ambassador “fizzes across the room.”</p>
<p>But the quirk that is likely to annoy most readers is the constant clarification of pronouns that refer to Cromwell. The novel is written in third-person limited point of view, and novelists using this perspective usually use the main character’s proper name when necessary. Mantel, however, has adopted the habit of using both pronoun and proper name, as in “He, Cromwell, sees Chapuys” or “he, Cromwell, was trying to break down Thomas More.” It’s frequent and distracting. Worse, it’s usually unnecessary, and in a writer as skilled as Hilary Mantel, it’s also baffling.</p>
<p>All that acknowledged, why did I tear through this four-hundred-plus page novel in half a day? I’m fascinated by the Tudor period, for one, but the writing is also compelling. Cromwell, who is often characterized as monstrous and unfeeling, reveals, in Mantel’s hands, how easily contradictions between religious belief and political action sit in the human mind, and descriptions like this, that use sustained metaphor beautifully, kept me reading:</p>
<p>[Anne Boleyn] orders her women out: a vehement gesture, a child scaring crows.  Unhurried, like bold corvines of some new and silky kind, the ladies gather their trains, flap languidly away; their voices like voices from the air, trail behind them: their gossip broken off, their knowing cackles of laughter. Lady Rochford is the last to take wing, trailing her feathers, reluctant to yield the ground (106).</p>
<p>The passages featuring Anne are, for me, the strongest in the book. From her early appearance, with her “dark glitter, now rubbed a little, flaking in places” (36) to her death, when her “flat little presence” on the scaffold “becomes a puddle of gore,” Anne Boleyn is, despite the presence of Cromwell, the dramatic center of this story.</p>
<p>Don’t read <em>Bring up the Bodies </em>for its plot. If you are interested enough in Tudor England to have picked it up, you already know what’s going to happen. There is no suspense, and there are no unexpected twists or turns. Read the book if you want original character study and insight into the complex, often violent, events that governed Europe during the Renaissance. The Tudors still loom large in the Western imagination, and Hilary Mantel has made good use of that continued fascination.</p>
<p>P.S. Stay away from <em>Secrets of the Tudor Court</em>, which tells the story of Mary Howard, Anne Boleyn’s cousin. The novelized account of this poor woman’s life makes such frequent use of popular psychology (such as “cycles of violence” and “projection”) that it is almost unreadable. There are no “secrets” revealed, except, possibly, that Mary Howard was even more insipid and stupid than we feared.</p>

<p>2012 must be a banner year for Nathan Englander. He has (at long last) come out with his second collection of short stories titled What We Talk About When We Talk About Anne Frank, he teamed up with Jonathan Safran Foer to release a new Haggadah, and his first play, “The Twenty-Seventh Man,” will be produced in November. The play was originally the first short story in Englander’s remarkable debut collection, <em>For the Relief of Unbearable Urges</em>, published in 1999. Most of the collection focuses on post-World War Two orthodox Jewish Americans who carefully (or in some cases recklessly) calculate identity as they maneuver the strict ethics and laws of the Judaic condition. Other stories, especially “The Tumblers,” set during the Holocaust, challenge readers with darkly twisted humor in the most desolate other-worldly circumstances. The elegance of this particular story provokes wonder; how does Englander encase hideous history within writing that seems fitting for wonderland fables? Englander continues through the rest of the collection to display this deft ability to juggle apparently mismatched tones and subjects with poise.  “Reb Kringle” is about an unfortunate rabbi forced to make extra money by dressing up as Santa Claus during the holiday season, until he finds a Jewish boy sitting on his lap. The title story shadows a desperate man who seeks remedy from his rabbi. His wife has discontinued intimacy, so the rabbi presents him a most jarring proposition to alleviate his itch, and the acceptance of the resolution proves to be more unbearable than relieving. At times his absurd exaggerations, such as in “The Gilgul of Park Avenue,” make the comical aspects redundant and tiring. “The Twenty-Seventh Man,” however, is sublimely, but sickeningly, the impeccable combination of haunting and hilarious. In this tale inspired by Stalin’s “Night of the Murdered Poets,” twenty-six Jewish Russian literary giants are gathered in cells, the last to join them in their final days is an unknown twenty-seventh man, a so-called fool. Those readers who have even the slightest devotion to freedom of expression may find themselves laughing through tears.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/06/coldest.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-651" title="coldest" alt="" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/06/coldest.jpeg" width="108" height="160" /></a>Coal Black Horse</em> and <em>Far Bright Star</em> convinced me that Robert Olmstead can write as well as anyone around about the solitude, the boredom, the hellish waiting and the sheer horror that beset men at war, about to go to war and trying to recover from war.  He also has few rivals when it comes to writing about horses and men.  At his best he invites comparison to Hemingway, Crane and McCarthy, and in much of <em>The Coldest Night</em> he is at his best.  Olmstead writes of violence and its impact as few American writers today do, with a moral compass which directs timing, detail, duration and context, always in the service of reminding us that violence is not a flashy bouquet to flourish for the pleasure of the nearly-unshockable, nearly-insatiable contemporary audience.  Like Yeats, he knows that something terrible can be beautiful, but it is no less terrible for that.</p>
<p>In brief: <em>The Coldest Night</em>&#8216;s Henry Childs is a sensitive but strong West Virginia adolescent who falls in love with Mercy, a girl above his station in life.  In Part 1, the teenagers tease and tryst and abscond together, but paternal power eventually catches up to them and metes out punishment.  In Part II, Henry and his fellow Marine, the wise-cracking Lew Devine, march and crouch, scamper and flinch, kill and pity, learning all the steps in the dance of death as it is performed in the Chosin Reservoir.  Part III: though wounded and damaged, Henry returns to Charleston and strives to recover, but he is stamped with blood to his core, and his experiences dominate his waking and dreaming life.</p>
<p>What I love about this book is its engagement with the environment &#8212; natural, man-made or just hellish.  Olmstead is one of our great observers and listeners &#8212; &#8220;Beyond them in the darkness came a whippoorwill&#8217;s call and then the banging sound of a train taking up slack.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chapter 14 begins to describe the American forces&#8217; movement toward combat: &#8220;It was the Korean autumn when the division marched north through the dusty barren countryside, marched up through the rice fields and apple orchards.  It was the shineless autumn sky in the season of mortality and turning into winter as they marched north along the east coast highway through the tiny villages.  The fruit trees were leafless and stripped bare of their fruit and some were split and shivved and splintered with bullets and their upturned roots exploded from below the ground in broken claws.&#8221;  Almost Hemingway, or James Jones, but Olmstead boldly lets the sentences march on with no impediment, as the precision of his observation creates the clarity.</p>
<p>The book&#8217;s significant disappointment, at least for my taste, lies in its final dozen pages and its opening section.  Although Henry&#8217;s mother and grandfather are captivating characters, and the boy&#8217;s thoughts and actions concerning a particular horse are appealing, the love story in Part I wears thin quickly.  However engaging Henry is in other matters, his take on romance (along with the narrator&#8217;s) veers too closely to the conventions and language of the Romance genre for me, too much theatrical moonlight and sighing.  The quick transformation from puppy love to usually-euphemistic sex scenes (binges, really) is too predictable, and the star-crossed lovers of section I seem more callow than their famous antecedents, and without the Shakespearean language.</p>
<p>I understand that Olmstead is creating a counterpointing architecture for the book, and perhaps the love story must be hyperbolic and Henry must attract our sympathies (even if Mercy is too fey and scatty to earn them), and Henry must also be heart-broken and desperate by the end of the first act.  But Henry is much more alive and interesting when he&#8217;s thinking about something else, with memories of Mercy just coloring the present, than when she&#8217;s physically present.</p>
<p>That said, the story of brotherhood under arms, of how modern warfare creates a wasteland whose survival hardly seems worth the anguish, of growth and the making of a man in a crucible designed to dehumanize all &#8212; that story is rendered here with Olmstead&#8217;s signature command of language and empathy.  Weather, landscape, the movements of adversaries and how they register and are turned in the mind of a man who wants to understand and take responsibility for his own acts and thoughts &#8212; Olmstead manages these as well as anyone, and no one could fault him for lack of ingenuity or heart.</p>

<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/06/nightwoods.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-649" title="nightwoods" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/06/nightwoods.jpeg" alt="" width="107" height="160" /></a>The lean, taut narrative of <em>Nightwoods</em> creates a story in which the setting holds as much spark as the characters, and is the central factor that brings forth the theme of the overwhelming power of nature. Charles Frazier writes about a young woman, Luce, who renounces the perils of civilization in favor of the raw beauty of the mountainous Appalachian South. In her self-exile, Luce attempts to find solace in the quiet mother the woods provides, but instead has to uphold the natural responsibility of taking care of her sister’s twin son and daughter after she is murdered by her husband, Bud. Unwittingly, Luce kindles a gradual maternal love for these children, and attempts to offer them security from their belligerent father while teaching them to tame their primal proclivity for fire. In this novel, Frazier offers depictions of various manifestations of nature—fire, the woods, the mountains—in such a way that underlines the bonds and emotions expressed by the characters. Though at times edging on the melodramatic, Frazier’s writing ultimately conveys the timeless message of survival and endurance.</p>
<p>Luce’s name speaks to her character, as <em>lucere</em> in Latin means “to shine.” Rather than allow her rape to smother her, she takes to the woods where her light becomes radiant. She embraces this secluded environment as preferable to the ugliness she had experienced at the hands of “civilized” mankind, for she considers “life” to have gotten “in the way” of nature. Her love for the wild becomes clear and is exemplified when she chooses to burn her canoe—her vehicle to society that made “town…only twenty minutes away.” She chooses to be an outsider and enjoys her removed existence. When she becomes caretaker to her niece and nephew, she recognizes the primitive, wild natures of these “tiny cavemen.” They are silent and communicate their angst through the physical act of destruction, markedly in setting things on fire. Yet, she is able “to shine” for these children and thus tame their rawness. Luce develops a love for them born of responsibility, a commitment stemming from her belief that “you take care of whatever needy things present themselves to you during your passage through [the world]. Otherwise you’re worthless.” With her love, she demonstrates to the twins that fire can be curbed to be warming, lapping flames of positive emotion.</p>
<p>Fire resurfaces throughout the novel as a metaphor for passionate emotion. Just as fire can be destructive when rampant and useful when controlled, too much passion can lead to vicious sentiment. Bud, the central antagonist of the novel, exemplifies this notion, as he justifies his flaming violence for its “spur-of-the-moment…purity.” After killing his wife, he passionately seeks to find the money he’s convinced she’s hidden. It is this drive that brings him to target his children. His desire utterly consumes him and can potentially consume all in his path, leaving devastation in his wake. The tempered love Luce exhibits works to stem this, in order to provide protection for her charges.</p>
<p>In essence, this is a violent story made palatable by Frazier’s measured and evocative prose. Though this characteristic of the novel actually interrupts any immediate pull to draw readers in, it provides a quiet strength akin to Luce’s that proves to be quite compelling. This is beautifully evidenced in the diction of the following descriptive passage where Luce reflects upon nature as an overwhelming force:<br />
&#8220;The black hole [of nature] was before life and beyond life. If you dipped a ladle of that water and drank it, visions would come so dark you wouldn&#8217;t want to live in the world that contained them. You&#8217;d be ready to flee toward the other darkness summed up in death, which is only distant kin to the black hole and the liquid it cups.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frazier fluidly guides the reader through <em>Nightwoods</em>, bolstering the inherent tension of his plotline through this understated style of writing.</p>
<p>Nature in its many guises becomes so important to this novel due to Frazier’s lush depictions, which indicate his profound knowledge of the region. He is able to manipulate natural elements and artfully integrate them into his story, implementing them as undercurrents to character interactions and relationships. In one of his many descriptions of setting, Frazier entwines fire and flora as, &#8220;poplars were already half bare and long grasses drooped burnt from the first frost. Bands of lavender and state clouds moving against a metallic sky, denoting the passage of autumn. Fallen leaves blown on the porch.&#8221; Though these passages add texture to his novel, there were perhaps so many of them that Frazier’s focus veered from adding depth to his plotline. For instance, in their shadow Bud began to seem like a caricature supervillain by the end of the novel, given no character depth aside from his bloodthirst.</p>
<p>The core value of <em>Nightwoods</em> lies in this novel’s superior construction. Frazier’s frequent use of fiery diction and imagery burns the book’s theme into readers’ minds, and adds to the notion of nature as an overwhelming force. Yet, perhaps the novel focuses too much on displaying Frazier’s writing toolbox rather than the core story, which was predictable at best. This can be easily forgiven, however, by relishing the descriptions Frazier offers of the Appalachian South of the late 1950’s. The enduring quality of nature is thus injected into the text, allowing <em>Nightwoods</em> to attain lasting literary worth.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/06/last-child1.jpeg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-468" title="last child" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/06/last-child1.jpeg" alt="" width="146" height="220" /></a>Caveat lector: I seem to be in a meddlesome mood.<span>  </span>And from the starting gun, I don’t want you to think that I’m recommending this book for the reader primed for precise and evocative, character-driven fiction, though there are moments when one imagines John Hart might have some interest and ability in that direction.<span>  </span>I’m writing about <em>The Last Child</em> because (1) it was so well received (2) it seems representative of a rampant impulse in current fiction &amp; (3) it poses a serious question: how do publishers manage to promote such thrillers, with impunity, as highly skilled and provocative writing?</p>
<p>I almost bought a copy of <em>Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter</em> a couple of weeks ago, but I already had a copy of <em>TLC</em>, so widely praised (a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller, starred reviews in <em>Library Journal</em> and <em>Booklist</em>), and I figured I should work further into my “to read” list and not add to it something from the current undead mania and likely to irritate and frustrate me. Do I need to say here that “entertainment” isn’t an accurate description of the ore I’m mining for when I do my “leisure reading”?<span>  </span>Snobby, I reckon, but by no means am I immune to the skillful thriller or sprawling excess of a historical novel, though I like to know what wood I’ve entered as I begin the trek. <em>TLC</em> was advertised at “Huck Finn channeled through <em>Lord of the Flies”</em> (so saith <em>The Washington Post</em>), and that appealed to me, though I eventually concluded it was more like <em>Tom Sawyer</em> meets “The Ransom of Red Chief,” with a strong dose of Stephen King. But “more matter and less art,” right? Here’s my beef.</p>
<p>How to distinguish between “plot driven” and “character driven”? In the latter, the most significant revelations are about what this or that character IS, who he/she IS. The enterprise runs even deeper than “motive” or what (God help us) profilers discover. The real investigation I’m drawn to is the nature of human nature. Certainly what the character DOES is crucial; if Huck decided he should help Jim but just dilly-dallied and lollygagged but didn’t act, well, road to hell paved over again. But it’s that process of learning about the rapacious and unfair side of the human animal that makes Huck question himself and the conventions of his community. (He doesn’t actually have to GO to hell for right reason and action; but he has to be willing.)</p>
<p>And <em>TLC</em> is rife with characters – the obsessed rogue detective, the obsessed aberrant boy, the missing angel child, the irresponsibly drugged-out mother, the twisted cop, the abusive and arrogant rich guy, the weak sidekick, the good-hearted but dull African-American giant, pedophiles and pervs of all stripes. If you want types, Hart (who names his detective co-hero “Hunt”) supplies them with commendable generosity.</p>
<p>And the good thing about types is that their actions can be shaped and(even more important in a mystery) timed to fit the outline.Every character is built upon two or three vectors, so they will sit and fetch and beg on command. So these two irritants come together: Reader really knows all about these people a quarter of the way through the book; Reader sees their calendars dovetailing perfectly to fit the outline.<span>  </span>When a girl is abducted exactly one year after another missing child incident (which turns out not to have been an abduction), her vanishing and re-emergence trigger a manhunt which discloses many remains, mostly children (too much <em>CSI</em>, etc!). Coincidences run amok.<span>  </span>Boys in danger and dangerous villains and rambling cops all seem to be listening to a higher power which frequently says “converge here now.”</p>
<p>I’m going into overtime myself. Quickly, two other disappointments. First, the author employs shifts in point of view for expediency and not dramatic or structural necessity, and he seems to have no strategy, no overall shape in mind. Second, sometimes the writing is dreadful. Hart can turn a phrase when he wants to, but those sequences of one-word sentences (and one-word paragraphs) meant to intensify and deepen really seem a little silly, though Stephen King seems to have transcended silly in the minds of many, despite his addiction to the flung single syllable. Here’s an example, unfair because it’s one of the worst, but I’m in my closing argument: “Disgust was an organ in Hunt’s gut.” Come again? No, never mind.</p>
<p>So why are the blood and the twisted nature of the story leading newspapers (yeah, I know) to say <em>TLC</em> “Rises to serious literature”? My guess is that the bar has been set so low by the series novels and splatterfest films that a book which suggests that the monsters are among us down in eastern N.C. (despite the lack of dialect markers and idiom, genuine regional lore or the resonance of a real culture) is a clean change of shirts. You’ve heard of made-for-TV movies; this is a made-for-TV book, except that it seems already from TV, though maybe that’s the point.</p>
<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/06/vampire-hunter.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-469" title="vampire hunter" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/06/vampire-hunter.jpeg" alt="" width="171" height="253" /></a>[Coda: In case anyone&#8217;s dying to know, I did eventually read Seth Grahame-Smith&#8217;s <em>Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter</em> and found it an even mix of entertainment and annoyance. Coincidence and obfuscation (especially pertaining to what powers vampires have and how a man with an axe can be quick enough and strong enough to defeat them in combat) interfere with any scrupulous attempt to willingly suspend disbelief. Twain&#8217;s hilarious &#8220;Fenimore Cooper&#8217;s Literary Offenses&#8221; provides a useful litmus for both the plotting and the style of the novel, and one wonders why the author chose to fabricate journals by Abraham Lincoln for this face-paced confection. Lincoln is one of the most distinctive prose stylists in American literature, but the style of these &#8220;extracts&#8221; is hysterical with exclamation marks, often flaccid and almost devoid of Lincoln&#8217;s signature rhetorical architecture. It&#8217;s all too much <em>Dark Shadows</em> and not enough Bram Stoker. As for the highly-touted research behind the book, most of the history can, in fact, be gleaned from Wikipedia, and Grahame-Smith manufactures fictoids like an affair between John Wilkes Booth and Mary Surratt to no evident purpose. A writer at <em>Vanity Fair</em> called ALVH &#8220;the funniest, most action-packed, and weirdly well-researched account of the Civil War you&#8217;ll probably read in a long time. . . ,&#8221; but the firing on Fort Sumter occurs with the book nearly 80% done. Did anyone who blurbed the book read the whole thing? I won&#8217;t say I regret spending an afternoon on it, and the cleverness is undeniable, while the book&#8217;s fundamental concept is wild and weird and might have made for a fine short story in the horror genre. It&#8217;s perhaps worth saying that Grahame-Smith also wrote the screenplay to the wild and delightful film version that not only omits most of the story but adds some delicious touches of its own, and the visual spectacle of stampede, vampire ball, and trestle conflagration made that matinee a fine one, indeed.]</p>

<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/05/yusef1.jpeg"><img src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/05/yusef1.jpeg" alt="" title="yusef" width="132" height="198" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-670" /></a><strong>Erudition as Disguise</strong></p>
<p>On occasion, an eager and adept reader happens upon a poetry collection that satisfies immediately. The lyric intensity of individual poems may carry the volume, or the narrative arc may be so compelling and taut that the reader shelves the collection knowing where the journey has taken her and that she’s been accompanied by a reliable guide.  <em>The Chameleon Couch</em> is not one of those collections.  In this, his eighteenth volume of poems, Yusef Komunyakaa employs a nearly overpowering display of erudition, a seemingly boundless range of historical and cultural referents, and a facility for metaphor and image, all of which combine both to dazzle and befuddle the reader.  Only a very small audience should approach <em>The Chameleon Couch</em> without a powerful search engine and adequate time for more than one reading.  The poems, however, ultimately justify the effort required to comprehend Komunyakaa’s purpose and how he goes about achieving it.</p>
<p>Frost suggested that a volume of poetry should be constructed well enough to serve as its own concluding poem. Most collections fall short on that count, but <em>The Chameleon Couch</em> is an exception. Recurring images link the three untitled sections, but the second section exhibits a thematic unity not evidenced in the first and third portions of the book.  Of the sixteen poems in the middle section, at least ten allude to, or explicitly refer to, war or combat. This is not a re-tilling of ground already plowed in <em>Dien Cai Dau</em>, although readers familiar with Komunyakaa’s biography and poems about his Viet Nam experiences may not be able to avoid making a connection.  What is striking in these war poems is Komunyakaa’s ability and willingness to focus relentlessly on the topic and yet do so in ways that remain fresh and surprising.</p>
<p>In the ekphrastic “Three Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion,” Komunyakaa explores a triptych painted by Francis Bacon.  War is never mentioned explicitly, but other horrors are:</p>
<blockquote><p>Did the painter ascend a dogwood<br />
or crawl into the hold of a slave ship<br />
to get a good view of the thing<br />
turning itself inside out beneath<br />
a century of interrogation lamps?</p></blockquote>
<p>The references to the crucifixion of Jesus (the dogwood legend), the slave trade, and torture convey with abundant clarity a tone of dread.  The poem requires no further investigation; but, as is the case often in <em>The Chameleon Couch</em>, a little mining yields treasure.  Here, a few clicks of the mouse will reveal that Bacon painted this bizarre and troubling work in 1944 at the height of World War II.  The poem’s images suddenly bear additional weight.  Komunyakaa then ends the poem with three of the most memorable lines in the entire collection, exhibiting both this poet’s mastery of image and his view that alienation, estrangement, and struggle are the critical markers of humankind’s existential situation—a perspective that permeates <em>The Chameleon Couch</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A twisted globe of flesh<br />
is held together by what<br />
it pushes against.</p></blockquote>
<p>The second section displays also Komunyakaa’s familiarity with Greek mythology and his ability to employ it in a way that, for the curious, motivated reader, adds additional texture to the poems.  In “Orpheus at the Second Gate of Hades,” the speaker is determined to make his second visit to the underworld despite unsettling recollections of the first visit – Furies, Tantalus, Tityus, Ixion, Sisyphus, Proserpine, and King Pluto.  Readers may be tempted to acknowledge Komunyakaa’s erudition and move on, shamed briefly by their familiarity only with the poet’s more contemporary allusions.  But that would be a mistake.  Poems like this one—and there are plenty here – require deliberate and resourceful reading.  The reader who is acquainted, or willing to become acquainted, with Greek mythology will be rewarded when the poem turns at line 41 to the speaker’s compulsion to speak of what he had seen:</p>
<blockquote><p>I saw a stall filled with human things, an endless<br />
list of names, a hill of shoes, a room of suitcases<br />
tagged to nowhere, eyeglasses, toothbrushes,<br />
baby shoes, dentures, ads for holiday spas,<br />
&amp; a wide roll of thick cloth woven of living hair.</p></blockquote>
<p>The interlocking of mythical suffering with the list of the spoils of a Nazi death camp demands the reader’s attention and genuine appreciation not only for the poet’s virtuosity but also for his deep humanity.  Making this poem—one of the collection’s most emotionally compelling—even more notable is Komunyakaa’s insertion of one of the few overtly humorous notes in the entire book.  Immediately prior to the speaker’s gruesome inventory, he hints at trouble getting through the gate:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . I don’t remember<br />
exactly what I said at the ticket office<br />
my first visit here, but I do know it grew<br />
ugly.  The classical allusions didn’t<br />
make it any easier. . . .</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the poems in the second section that does not address warfare explicitly offers another glimpse of the array of Komunyakaa’s cultural resources.  The immediate setting of “Blackbirding On the Hudson” is Czestochowa, Poland, where the speaker is reminded of the Hudson River when he pulls from the shelf a volume of poetry and opens it to Robert Lowell’s “The Mouth of the Hudson.”  The speaker recalls specific images from the Lowell poem, the “coke fumes &amp; the chemical air of / New Jersey.”  The Hudson’s flow and Lowell’s solitary figure, standing as if admiring the birds, calls to the speaker’s mind “another phrase—I think it is ‘blackbirding’— / pecking fiercely / at my gut.”  Besides echoing the vulture poised to tear at Tityus’s liver in “Orpheus at the Second Gate of Hades,” these lines mark a turn toward a complex reflection on the slave trade, the river’s permanent indifference in the face of its own despoliation, and the mood set by Thelonius Monk’s rendition of “Coming on the Hudson.”  As jarringly impressive as this plenitude of resources is, the reader will at some point in her reading ask whether Komunyakaa’s willingness to display his virtuosity with such abandon is a distraction and, if it is, whether that effect is intentional.  Before engaging that larger question, however, a brief look at poems in the first and third sections of the book is in order.</p>
<p>Although the first section of <em>The Chameleon Couch</em> is a looser thematic unit than section two, the poems here do share images and concerns that both permeate the entire collection and organize this portion of the book.  As with much of Komunyakaa’s poetry, music is a constant.  Expected allusions and explicit references to blues and jazz music and personalities appear in “Black Figs” and “Ignis Fatuus.”  More unusual is the poet’s meditation on a Japanese bamboo flute in “Ode to the Shakuhachi.”  That poem exemplifies the demands this collection places on the reader.  Komunyakaa’s reference to a famous piece composed for Shakuhachi, “The Sound of Deer Calling to One Another,” is not essential to the poem but invites the curious reader to investigate.  Perhaps it deepens subsequent approaches to the poem, but sometimes a distraction is just a distraction.</p>
<p>The volume’s opening poem, “Canticle,” forecasts the musical theme and puts the reader on notice that, although the poet will provide points of access, the trail will not always be well-marked.  Before shifting abruptly to a present tense East Village scene, one finds this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . Seasons sprouted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; went to seed as we circled the dance with silver cat bells<br />
tied to our feet.  Now, kissing you, I am the archheir of second<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chances.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because I know twelve ways to be wrong<br />
&amp; two to be good, I was wounded by the final question in the cave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; left side of the spirit level’s quiver.  I didn’t want to hug you<br />
into a cross, but I’m here to be measured down to each numbered<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bone.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A trembling runs through what pulls us to the blood knot.</p></blockquote>
<p>More hospitable—and thematically indicative of the collection as a whole—is another poem ostensibly related to Komunyakaa’s musical interests, “The One-Handed Concerto.”  The poet uses Ravel’s commissioned composition of the “Piano Concerto for the Left Hand” for Paul Wittgenstein, Ludwig’s older brother, to discuss absence, loss, and alienation.  Present at the same time is an instant of humor which, unfortunately, occurs too infrequently in this volume.  Both are at play when the poet reflects on the pianist’s war injury:</p>
<blockquote><p>Perhaps he could even forget &amp; snap<br />
the fingers of his lost hand to call his dog home,<br />
&amp; it would come running full trot, wagging its tail.<br />
But he didn’t know if he’d ever learn to play absence,<br />
because he could cover only one ear.</p></blockquote>
<p>Komunyakaa also includes in the first section what is arguably one of his best poems addressing racial oppression.  In “Cape Coast Castle,” the image of the slave trade center in Ghana before its relocation in 1877 follows the speaker and his lover from western Africa to Amsterdam and is pushed aside only by the ghost of his mother, and then only temporarily.  In a passage that, oddly enough, calls to mind the speaker’s realization in James Dickey’s “Slave Quarters” “that there is no hatred / Like love in the eyes / Of a wholly owned face . . . ,” Komunyakaa describes the “governor,” his selection of a slave woman to be brought to his rooms, and his approach to subjugating a race:  “There’s a whole tribe in this one, but I’ll break them / before they’re in the womb, before they’re conceived, / before they’re even thought of.”  Aside from the horror so effectively conveyed in this poem, the appearance of the ghost should not be overlooked.  It is one of at least seven references to ghosts in <em>The Chameleon Couch</em>.  Along with even more frequent invocations of the mask image and repeated references to shadows and labyrinths, Komunyakaa is hinting at the collection’s estrangement motif.  Images of impermanence and disguise abound in this first section.  With the ephemeral swamp gas in “Ignis Fatuus,” the “shape shifter” in “Ode to the Chameleon,” and the devil fish, makeup, sunglasses, and bleaching cream in “Ten or Eleven Disguises,” the poet is laying the foundation for a construct that is only visible in its entirety after the reader reflects upon the collection.</p>
<p>The third section of the book, by far the longest, is the least satisfying as a thematic unit; however, the miscellany is packed not only with echoes of poems appearing earlier in the volume but also of poems from prior collections.  In the concluding section, readers will note, for example, the reappearance of the Thorn Merchant in “The Thorn Merchant’s Godson.”  In addition to masks (“The Hedonist”), labyrinths (“Goodness,” “Surrender”), and ghosts (“Last of the Monkey Gods” and “Adonis in the Big Apple,” among others), this section also includes two overtly political poems, “Green” and “Dangerousness,” and the collection’s sole illustration of Komunyakaa’s facility with prose poems (“A Voice on an Answering Machine”).  Although traditional formal elements are not a distinguishing feature of <em>The Chameleon Couch</em>, Komunyakaa’s attention to sound effects in many of the poems is appropriate in a collection incorporating so many musical allusions.  One example from “Ontology &amp; Guinness” in this third section shows that, in addition to his obvious delight in manipulating theme, image, and cultural resourcefulness, the poet has not forsaken basic elements of craft:</p>
<blockquote><p>I can taste tear gas.  I hear a blur<br />
of billy clubs when I hit the drums.<br />
I haven’t witnessed this mug shot<br />
in decades, but I’m facing the mirror.<br />
I’m still the same man.  Almost.<br />
Led Zeppelin is still in my nogginbox.</p></blockquote>
<p>The slant rhymes, assonance, and alliteration are palpable, and examples of the poet’s fine ear can be found in almost every poem.</p>
<p>Yet image, metaphor, and allusion comprise this collection’s dominant currency.  Indeed, the volume is defined by the poet’s focus on image, the plethora of allusions, and the continual return to ideas of absence and estrangement combined with his persistent and effective efforts to deny the reader easy access while offering enough points of contact to keep the reader engaged.  Respect and admiration for a poet of Komunyakaa’s brilliance and resourcefulness requires that one assume that the poet intends every word and at least anticipates every effect.  He thinks about his audience and what their reaction might be.  It could be, of course, that Komunyakaa intends a very small audience for <em>The Chameleon Couch</em>.  But poems like “Grunge,” with its almost slapstick confusion of courtly love and Courtney Love, suggest otherwise.  Komunyakaa knows how to make a poem accessible.  He also knows how to make poems simultaneously difficult and rewarding.  “Flesh,” for example, certainly requires either prior knowledge of Dante and Beatrice or determination to figure it out.  Even poems like “Adonis in the Big Apple,” which will leave most readers scratching their heads about the identity of the protagonist (is it Jimmy Blanton?), invite—and then reward—curiosity and exploration.  Other poems, however, tease and seem to thwart understanding intentionally.  For example, there is no discernible reason, other than delight in the music, to insert into “Goodness” these lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . On how many paths<br />
do we dare seek the spun knot<br />
beneath the plum tree bent down<br />
with blooms in the Middle Kingdom?</p></blockquote>
<p>It would be sadistic to invite a reader into a poem with the sole intent of baffling her halfway in.  In that case, one might interpret the third section’s “Surrender” as less of a description and more of a command.  But Komunyakaa is not cruel.  Therefore, these poems that run along smoothly enough until stiff-arming the reader must have another intent, and only after coming back to the collection after at least one careful reading does one discern Komunyakaa’s masterful pacing and control.  Through the onslaught of mythical, musical, and historical allusions—through the back and forth of offering access and slamming the door—the poet makes a poem of the book, a poem willing to explore what is just beyond reach and the ways we hide ourselves for self-preservation, for life.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"> This prized fish on the wall in our suburban split-level is a rainbow trout, an identification I know because my husband made a point of telling me this, more than once, when he brought the fish home from the lake. When I forget what type of fish it is, the engraved brass plaque beneath the rainbow trout is there to remind me. There is no rainbow on this trout, though; just one long rosy band down the side that flares like a blush on the gills. Also, the fish’s skin is dotted with black speckles. So “rainbow” is not necessarily a given, not something I would naturally intuit about this fish. I admit I only know one side, the fish’s left side, but wouldn’t one safely assume its other side is more of the same? Sometimes I wonder though. This fish appears to have been pinned mid-leap to the wood behind it, as if it leapt up and got stuck there right in our dry house. The long curve of its body looks pliable and at the same time frozen stiff. The fish is empty. That silent open mouth with the underbite concerns me; it makes the fish appear at an utter loss to explain its circumstances. Its left eye stares at me when I use the chamois to clean the cobwebs from its gaping mouth. I’m most careful when I wipe the artificial tongue.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">A real trout’s tongue is quite long and barbed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Mounted just above the fish’s head is the jig, in other words, the hook and lure the fish swallowed. This jig resembles a flashy skirt that hides the hook. When this fish swallowed the hook, the hook lodged deep in the back of its tongue and stayed there. Even if it had not grown to an unfortunate trophy size, this fish was a goner. My husband refused to cut the line to release the fish; he wasn’t about to lose that lure. Now the lure is mounted right there alongside the fish’s mouth, just out of its reach.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I don’t fish with my husband. I can’t stand how the fish look once they’ve been landed, the way their mouths open and close, open and close, with no sound.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">My husband likes to tell the story of how he caught this fish. “True story,” he always begins. I’ve heard it so often I sometimes misremember; I get confused and become convinced that I was the one out on the clear lake that day with my rod and reel, that I was the one who saw this amazing thing leap straight out of the water into blue sky, saw it flash and twist high in the sun, that I was the one who felt the splash on my cheek when it dropped deep back into the cold lake. And I am the one who feels a suffocating sadness when I recall how strong this fish was while it fought.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">To land such a fish as this is rare. When you fish for trout you must make that jig dance just so.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The fish is mounted over our bed. For a trout, this fish is enormous. When I look at it long enough, yes, I can see that it’s beautiful; but also that it’s monstrous. Its length is nearly as wide as our bed. My husband says it weighed over 39 pounds. Not anymore. This fish has been hollowed out. My husband paid a fortune to have it done. Its stripped skin has been expertly dried and stretched over a frame that restores it to its fish-like shape. Its gleaming scales are polished and sealed. At night, before my husband turns out the light, I stare up at its pale silver belly. When we make love, I close my eyes and dream of leaping into fresh water.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reviewed by Lisa Russ Spaar</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="secure the shadow" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/05/secure-the-shadow.jpeg" alt="" width="115" height="172" />Claudia Emerson’s poems have always stalked liminal territories—abandoned houses, vestigial buildings reclaimed by wildness, bodies caught in birth and death throes, the crucibles of girlhood, middle and old-age, the half-lives of institutions, situations, places, and families evaporating or succumbing to obliteration even as they tenaciously abide. She finds the sweet spot—the blue, the bent, the worried note—between lyric and narrative. Image and reality. Voice and silence. In the way that Emily Dickinson&#8217;s poems represent unnamed, precipitating crises of terror and awe by the word “it,” appearing at times in Dickinson as the contraction “Twas” (“It is dead – find it,” for example, or “It dropped so low in my regard” or “’Twas like a Maelstrom, with a notch” or “’Twas warm at first, like us”), Emerson’s <em>Secure the Shadow</em> is rife with the word.<span>  </span>In the opening, sonnet-haunted 14-line section of “Half-Life: Pittsylvania County, Virginia,” for instance, Emerson uses some form of “it” six times—</p>
<blockquote><p>That some slow, cold distant planet formed<br />
with a core of ice and stone and named<br />
for the embodiment of sky and heaven<br />
should have anything to do with it seemed wrong—<br />
given its rumored rise from pitchblende to the surface<br />
of fields and pasture, its dissolve into the wells<br />
dug and the ponds made for the animals,<br />
or its decay into the brief, more deadly</p>
<p>daughters—an old explosion’s persistent, widening<br />
wake—and now even more wrong, given its ungodly<br />
worth to the men who had already sold<br />
the rights to it, ignorant of the worse cost<br />
of confusing what chooses us with what we choose,<br />
the near-infinite half-life of remains.</p></blockquote>
<p>Emerson, like Dickinson, is less concerned with naming the ineffable source of horror or grief as she is with exploring its history and its aftermath, or its manifestation in “some small forgotten thing.” In “It,” a poem about what can happen to the human spirit forced to endure the travesties of warfare, Emerson excavates, again, not for the reason or cause of trauma, but for the “mouth closed-calm part of it,” for the aftermath of being blindsided, “with no way to tell it.”<span>  </span>The implication of this unnamable “it” is brought into concert with image and shadow in an italicized passage about a photograph from war-time,</p>
<blockquote><p>              &#8230;a girl, naked<br />
the scorched disfigurement</p>
<p>of her back unseen, inescapable<br />
as what had been the road</p>
<p>behind her, its vanishing point<br />
consumed inside an earthbound</p>
<p>cloud, her scream—seared<br />
aperture to something</p>
<p>the image cannot document.</p></blockquote>
<p>The undocumentable dimension reverberating beyond this image or of any effort we make in poems or photographs to frame and understand the horrific is something Emerson deepens into and confronts at the poem’s close, in a passage which talks back to the earlier photograph as it describes the experience of a cousin, a Vietnam war veteran:</p>
<blockquote><p>          &#8230;He would be<br />
matter of fact, telling me about</p>
<p>the Agent Orange he’d breathed, believed revenant<br />
in a tumor, the cancer in his throat—</p>
<p>its remission. Not a day had passed<br />
when he hadn’t smelled it, tasted it—</p>
<p>the <em>it</em> slender and exact as a compass needle—<br />
he would say as though to the road ahead,</p>
<p>or suddenly blind to it, his eyes, tongue, throat,<br />
his voice I would hear burning with</p>
<p>a knowing beyond memory—wordless,<br />
imageless—the body’s own account.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Secure the Shadow</em> is not as overtly sequential or serial in its conception and curation as some of Emerson’s earlier collections, but the word “It,” comprised of the “columnar self” of the “I/i” and the torso crux of the “t,” becomes, as the book progresses, a kind of ideogram for the body/shadow that haunts and moves, pilgrim-like, throughout the poems. Like the “hinges, latches, / doorknobs, keys still sunk in the locks” that remain in smoldering ash after the house fire in the opening poem, “Late April House Fire Along Interstate 81,” the “it” is “all that does not burn,” even if its nominal antecedent cannot be adequately articulated or fixed. The history of the shadow and its body, as Charles Wright reminds us, may be short, it may be a “brief, nearly // beautiful suspension that changes nothing,” but this does not deter Emerson from delving there, at the liminal “hourless” nexus it creates, where the meanings and the mysteries are.</p>
<p>Proving the interplay of self and body is, of course, the shadow, derived from the Old English <em>sceadu</em> and in its most common usage denoting a dark figure or image caste on the ground by a body or other object intercepting light.<span>  </span>Cognate with <em>shade</em> (a protective barrier but also a spirit, ghost, or apparition), a shadow can also mean a darkness, a semblance, a trace, the dark part of a photograph or other picture, a period of gloom, a dominant or pervasive threat, an inseparable companion, a spy.All of these meanings and more float over Emerson’s collection, perhaps most powerfully in the title poem, which derives from a slogan for mortuary photography—that is, from an advertisement for a company engaged in the practice of taking photographs of dead loved ones:<span>  </span>“Secure the shadow ‘ere the substance fade.” Of one such photograph that the speaker is thinking of buying, Emerson writes (and note, again, the way “it” ghosts the poem with provocative pronominal slippage): “It appears at first glance to be an infant / asleep before the fact of death is clear.” The speaker goes on to say that “the photograph contains the whole of it” and, later, that “while / the posture is of sleep, the heavy-lidded / inward gaze of the eyes, not quite closed, / makes no pretense of it.” After considering the mother of the dead child and the other children she may have subsequently borne, “who lived and in surviving her / let go this image they must have feared,” the speaker explains how</p>
<p>with some reluctance, I purchase its further<br />
removal from them, from her—making mine<br />
this orphaned but still secure correspondence<br />
with all that is about to disappear.</p>
<p>All manner of threshold places allow Emerson to position herself at the juncture of what is about to but which has not yet completely disappeared. Porches, which belong both to house and to the outside world, figure in several poems about the incipient or recent death of loved ones. In “The Porch,” Emerson begins</p>
<blockquote><p>This is not illness, not yet dying,<br />
this stillness a changed way</p>
<p>of being here on the porch.</p></blockquote>
<p>Emerson juxtaposes “illness” and “stillness” here in way that shows us how these states of being inhabit and complicate one another. “Variations from the Porch,” an elegy for the speaker’s brother, positions a speaker on a porch although “the season for it [is] past”:</p>
<blockquote><p>                         I don’t know</p>
<p>what felt safe about that bleak<br />
reclusion, out where anyone</p>
<p>could have seen me; but I<br />
understand now that when</p>
<p>a bird sleeps under its own wing,<br />
it is the world that ceases to see.</p></blockquote>
<p>A group of children in “Animal Funerals, 1964,” caught as they are between innocence and experience, conduct a service for a dead blue jay by building a “delicate lychgate of willow fronds, // supple and green, laced through with chains of clover,” symbolic bower interface between what “was real” about death and what was part of their “necessary rehearsals” for it. In “Vacancy,” a motel swimming pool allows the girl speaker her liminal space, “My favorite place to be, just beneath / the surface, the underwater pool lights // coming on with night,” the poet/speaker weightless among “those fathomless sources // of small light I did not want to give up, // plenty of air yet in the joyous hold of my lungs.”</p>
<p>I have been reading Claudia Emerson’s poems for over 20 years; I doubt she will ever write, say, or sing anything I won’t lean in eagerly to hear. Her flood subjects—death, grief, the angel of history, the deep delight of story, music and its healing pulse—prevail, but her poems never lapse into parodies of themselves, stylistically or thematically. Emerson’s work is unafraid of the silence surrounding its ineffable “it” and her attention to it touches in the reader’s shadow/self a sorrow and capacity for wonder that feels veracious and inevitable. Emerson knows, when she writes of the “beautiful suspension that changes nothing,” that what Auden famously says in his elegy for Yeats is true: “poetry makes nothing happen.” We are born and die, we witness and our part in it all ends, even as the world, as Emerson puts it in “Jubilation,” goes “on bright and raucous / without it, no worse for the absence, perhaps.” But poetry, as Auden puts it, though it may not change anything, “survives / In the valley of its saying . . . // it survives, / A way of happening, a mouth.” <em>Secure the Shadow</em> is, like all of Emerson’s books, the kind of poetry tat helps a person to live, to believe that</p>
<blockquote><p> . . . surely that was jubilation she heard<br />
in the cicadas’ immediate flourish</p>
<p>of sound, as though the hour itself had been<br />
restored with the bird it had moved through.</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"> <strong>&#8220;The Pointer&#8221; received the 2nd annual Bevel Summers Prize for the Short Short Story.</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>Swallows fly in and out the broken windows of a V-12 silvered by weather, our great-grandfather’s ancient Sunday cruising sedan. We’re sitting on the hoods of the used-up cars that rust now on the first farm he ever owned, waiting for shooting hours to begin. We talk about our city jobs and toss a baseball back and forth. A profusely ticked young pointer, intelligent-eyed, with shivering legs, tilts her nose toward the sky as a gust of wind clears the ragged woods. Pinned against the logo on the side of a derelict tractor is a sunflower, brittle and spiked; the neighbor’s little combine did not catch it. Our watches say it’s time or we would dally there all day in the automobile graveyard.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>Out in the field we see the young pointer, John’s dog, quarter like an Elhew and shake the cover to pieces. Seeing her courage so young, we want to be bird dogs ourselves. John whistles her in and makes a show of apologizing that there are so few birds to find. The spring was wet and cold when it shouldn’t have been; young quail died of exposure by the thousands. Thousands more did not make it through the summer-long drought. We walk the cover anyway and carry our side-by-sides at port-arms as if we might have a chance to use them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">John keeps the pointer at heel until we’re within sight of the overgrown feedlot. Two hundred calves used to bawl here during each fall’s weaning. The original owner of the farm had built for his family an improbable four-story house. In the grass we see the stone foundation with nothing above it, the root cellar open to the skies, the splayed piles of weathered boards. We shift our path and walk around.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>In the feedlot the dog ghosts through foxtail spikes. The bell attached to her collar chimes. When there is no sound, we fight through the cover and see her standing so still it seems she cannot move. The bird is not the bobwhite we had been hoping for. The bird is a wren. We watch its swerving flight and crack our guns.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>At the family plot there are the matched headstones and what seems like too much space on every side. We walk the savage grass, the pointer leading us toward a wild plum thicket as bluebirds scatter. The headstones are turning green. Each year it is harder to read what they say. The family cemetery never took; our ancestor and his second wife alone honored the idea. We have killed birds near the graves before. We have stopped to talk about how this outsider did so much of the work of getting somewhere that we don’t have to. All of our own work, we have said, is just a kind of playing around.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>He should have died one winter; the polio was the worst sign yet of his father’s vexed luck in the new world. The virus damaged his leg for good. While his brothers and sisters helped labor to right the farm, he took piano lessons and was spoiled by his mother and aunts. No one went to college but him; only he needed to make a living in town. He studied military history, learned the Civil War to no end, went on to become a music teacher. He wore suits and won cash with his sunny tenor though his brothers never learned to read. Eventually, he made a killing dealing cars.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>Cow-and-calf operators sold out to him and he built his land empire. Some of the ruined men he kept on as hired hands or sharecroppers. They drove his cast-off cars and trucks to death to do his work for him, left them out in the open to save the cost of hauling them away.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>After he turned to business, our ancestor would do anything, it was said, to get another dollar. Crafty Irish bastard: the worst chiseler around. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>Wandering the last piece of land we have to know him by, we have shrugged our shoulders. Every family commits a shameful act. If it does not, a run of bad luck could set it back forever.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The next day we clamber on the cars in early afternoon. Our boots dangle near wheel wells; the backs of our knees graze bumpers. The last two hours we marched through hedgerow jungles without a break. The universe of clover across the wet-weather creek was also empty. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>A tractor starts up by the neighbor’s new barn; the engine catches and begins to rumble. A cropduster makes another pass above the neighbor’s winter wheat. John taps the hood of the V-12 and the pointer jumps up. In a moment she is on the roof. Facing forward, the beautiful dog we all admire ornaments the old sedan.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>After dark we take the ferry across the James and find our table at Taylor’s in town. Another empty place, another way of telling us the birds aren’t here. A game is on TV: seven-man football, the Triple A Championship carried live. The air stinks from a solitary cigar angled toward the ceiling by an aged farmer’s stumped fingers. He drinks by himself at the bar. Almost without noticing, we decide the matter: we’ll make a deal with the neighbor. By Christmas it will be done.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>Past midnight we spill out the door. The silent streets of the town rebuke us. We wander across railroad tracks and stand dumbstruck before a wire cage stuffed to a height of twenty feet with salvaged aluminum cans. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>In the daytime at the farm, the light was all over us. We could have been an army at rest, young men in camp at Shiloh after taking a dip in Owl Creek. Ten miles distant, the farm is quiet. The burying ground for old cars reveals three rows of still forms. Near the woods edge, the ancient V-12 sinks lower and pushes itself hard against the earth like a soldier drying himself in the sun. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>wetatuhneesáhUt.  I am holding onto the gut.</p>
<p>Wah.  Once they were accepted they were allowed inside—White men.  D. D. Mitchell, Indian Agent, among them.  They sent a boy.  The Arikara men.  Bear Medicine Men, their society.  They sent him.  Words, he gave them.  Their eyes showed the white of trust, them not having it.  They did not.  Belief—they could not open themselves to it.  They followed the boy, his words out in front.  Walking, they were behind them.</p>
<p>&#8220;A band of bears.  They are preparing now to demonstrate their power.  If you would like.  You may come and witness.&#8221;</p>
<p>The men, D. D. Mitchell, being one, were fat with the pleasure of the bears&#8217; invitation.  Stories.  They had heard them.  They knew.  Arikara men were known.  Bear Medicine Men Society was famous.  Six bears.  They looked like men wearing skins to the men whose eyes showed the white.  They looked like bears.  They were.  Sahnish.  Sitting.  The bears in the center of the lodge.  The people standing like grass around them.</p>
<p>This is the world.</p>
<p>We live in.</p>
<p>Everyone has their view.  A place for it was provided.  The small up close.  The large in the back.  Sitting or standing.  The men, D. D. Mitchell was one, were let so close they could easily tell.  Deception.  For it, they were looking.  Their faces, with the eyes that showed white reflected their mind.  Doubting D. D. Mitchell.  His thoughts, he recorded.  He was a white man, keeping a journal:  <em>I thought them so grotesquely made up I could not decide if they were ludicrous or frightful.  I was uncertain which response was the best:  laughter or terror.</em></p>
<p>Time lingers in the great Earth Lodge.  In this world we are living.  A young boy, again, he was called.  Clay.  It was needed.  The earth is particular.  Power has a place, so specific, instructions were detailed.  Where.  The boy, he was to go, a designated spot for digging.</p>
<p>It was soon.  His return from the river bed.  The clay, it was, given shape.  Each piece in the palm of a bear:  buffaloes, men, horses, bows and arrows.  Each clay man set on a mount, armed.  Each mount placed three feet in front.  The line of buffalo they were standing.</p>
<p>The man, his eyes still showing their white thought.  These were thoughts, he was thinking.  <em>Ludicrous solemnity.</em>  <em>They are performing.  Ridiculous.</em>  His thoughts, he wrote them, explaining how they were changing the arrangement.  Each one was placed, then the Bears addressed them, the hunters.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Children, mine.  I know the time between hunts has been long.  You are hungry.  I know.  Now.  Use strength.  Wah.  Kill as many as you can.  There are people here who are laughing if you do not kill.  They will, laugh.  Go now.  They  have already smelt you.  The buffalo, they have started.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The men with Mitchell were entirely amazed as the clay figures took off with the last breath of word.  The Bear&#8217;s mouth, he was speaking.  Straw arrows shot from clay bows pierced the buffalo three feet away.  The great animals began their falling.  Dead; they were falling.  All but two who completed the circle&#8217;s outermost edge with arrows sticking out of their sides, one with three, the other with five.  Finally they finished their fall.  Dead in the center.</p>
<p>At this he spoke, the same Bear Medicine Man, &#8220;Run.  Into the fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>One, it was lit.  Without fear they ran full toward the flame.  The horses pulled to a stop at the edge.  They were standing.  A clay rider called out—the leader— his anger clear,  &#8220;Why are you not going?&#8221;</p>
<p>The others of clay whipped their mounts.  The horses finally agreeing.  The flames took them at once—the mounts and their clay riders.  Tumbling into the flame.  The center taking them in, in a tumbling down they lay to bake.</p>
<p>The Bear Medicine Men gathered the slain buffalo and placed them on the fire.</p>
<p>Ash.</p>
<p>They were pounded down after baking dry.  The Bear Medicine Men spoke.  The men with the ridiculous eyes understood nothing of what they said.  No Translation.  The dust was brought to the top of the Earth Lodge and given to the wind.  The men with the white eyes still believe they were deceived, despite their senses.  They failed to understand the Bear Medicine Men&#8217;s Power:  the animated clay, the soul, the motion, the life.  Experience, they denied it, explained it away.  Their senses could not contradict what their thinking said was real.  Their breadth of power limited to them, individually, as one.</p>
<p>Man alone is nothing, shouting into the wind.  Believing the time is over, some, they have strange names, pledge allegiance to city limits.  Then it was our turn, the new everlasting feeling.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Italy, May, 2011</p>
<p>We’ve been in Bogliasco a week<br />
before we understand the bird that’s wakened us<br />
each miserably early morning is a nightingale.</p>
<p>I am pleased by this just as I was years ago,<br />
when I had my picture taken in Rome,<br />
kneeling next to the gravestone of John Keats.</p>
<p>Every time I look at that picture, I think, There I am, kneeling<br />
next to the gravestone of John Keats.  And this week,<br />
wakened every dark morning before four, I think,</p>
<p>I’m hearing the same kind of bird Keats wrote of, at Hampstead,<br />
in one of the great odes of 1819, and it makes me a little sad<br />
to confess that of them all I love the nightingale ode least.</p>
<p>Even the bird’s singing—fulsome and musical,<br />
especially in the still-dark Ligurian morning—<br />
does not appeal to me as it did to Keats.  At this deep blue</p>
<p>and aubadial hour, it’s too loud.  And too much.<br />
But then, so is the fact that on Bartleby.com,<br />
right there on my screen next to Keats’ poem,</p>
<p>is Alexia.  She’s beautiful and pouty, barely dressed,<br />
“in a relationship,” it says in Italian, but who<br />
“ha insoddisfatti desideri.”  She has “unsatisfied desires,”</p>
<p>in other words.  “Aiutala!,” it implores.  Help her!  Too much, yes,<br />
but interesting:  Keats, a nightingale, unsatisfied desires,<br />
the longing for perfection, and Alexia.  Here she is again,</p>
<p>this time alongside “To Autumn,” a poem I prefer,<br />
although now I’m puzzled by both her abundance<br />
and her ubiquity, since she’s next to the Grecian urn</p>
<p>and Melancholy too.  She’s not by the “Ode to Psyche,”<br />
which is strange, since the first words of that one are<br />
“O Goddess!,” and clearly that’s what Alexia’s meant to appear</p>
<p>to anyone who comes upon her here. (She’s 34, it says,<br />
almost a decade older than Keats ever was.)<br />
For some reason Bartleby prefers not to offer “Indolence” at all;</p>
<p>it’s nowhere on the site, though Keats himself described its subject<br />
as “the only happiness . . . the body overpowering the Mind,”<br />
something Alexia could be said to personify: a bold lover</p>
<p>one can never kiss.  As for the figures on the urn, it’s true,<br />
they will live in supple youth and mad pursuit<br />
as long as does the urn, and their desires will</p>
<p>in all that time go unsatisfied:  boughs that cannot shed<br />
their leaves, the piper who unwearied pipes new songs forever,<br />
the figures forever warm and still to be enjoyed, forever</p>
<p>panting, forever young.  Some believe Keats died a virgin.<br />
Others think his most worldly friend, Brown,<br />
surely took him to a brothel once.  Meanwhile, here in the dark</p>
<p>Italian morning, I left the woman I love in bed a floor below<br />
in order to investigate a bird whose song I never heard<br />
except in words.  I made my way to where, thousands of miles</p>
<p>from home and all my books, I could examine<br />
how such a thing might matter to me.  And when I sought<br />
Keats’ poems electronically, there was Alexia,</p>
<p>and since then I have thought more of her than of Keats,<br />
or my beloved, or the nightingale still singing outside.<br />
Even leaned dangerously far out the studio window,</p>
<p>I can’t see it.  And back on the computer screen, Alexia—<br />
despite the almost two-centuries-old, deathless lines<br />
to her right—insists that it is she who should have my attention,</p>
<p>even as the nightingale sings on.  Of love,<br />
Keats said, “It is my religion.  I could die for it.”<br />
He also said, “I would sooner fail than not be among</p>
<p>the greatest,” and then he died, believing himself a failure.<br />
If I abandon this task soon and return to our room,<br />
I’ll find my lover in bed, sleep-warm and soft.  But still,</p>
<p>there remains something I have not said and believed I could.<br />
I thought it had to do with poetry, but it seems I was wrong.<br />
Keats’ desire was to make something beautiful and true,</p>
<p>and also the satisfaction not only of knowing he’d done so,<br />
but that the world would know it and acknowledge it too,<br />
and that acknowledgment came too late to do him any good.</p>
<p>One more, and among the least, in the endless human plague<br />
of unsatisfied desires.  And what I might have said, or might yet,<br />
has nothing to do with the viewless wings of Poesy,</p>
<p>and more to do with the way the dull brain perplexes and retards<br />
the body’s progress toward love.  Imagine writing the line,<br />
“More happy love! more happy, happy love!”  What does it mean</p>
<p>that I can’t?   Her lack of satisfaction makes Alexia look miserable<br />
in an ever-so-ravishable way, but if I clicked on “Aiutala,”<br />
I would be no closer to her than I am to Keats.</p>
<p>Therefore, the villa’s twenty-four stone stairs<br />
back down to the second floor fly by as swift as in a dream,<br />
and back in my bed and my lover’s arms again,</p>
<p>it is my mind that reawakens and overpowers, for a while at least,<br />
my body, and I speak:  nothing of Alexia, Keats, the nightingale, or the odes;<br />
nothing of how tender the night has been, or the least sickness for home;</p>
<p>only remembrance, softly:  that she recall the night of the day<br />
she took my picture as I knelt by the grave of a Young English Poet.<br />
Weary from hours walking the ancient streets of Rome,</p>
<p>we lay on a roof-top terrace no more than a hundred yards<br />
from the room he died in.  In the distance, St. Peter’s dome<br />
glowed silver-blue.  Remember?  We were there all night,</p>
<p>and all night, gulls from the Tiber passed overhead, squawking.<br />
No one would ever describe their calls as soulful or melodious,<br />
but that night, I say, they were beautiful, and she is satisfied.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNoSpacing"> One lies on one’s back in the woods, savoring the sun,<br />
and for some reason one has opted<br />
for what Fowler calls the “false first person pronoun”—one,<br />
that is, over the other.  One brushes an ant from one’s ear.<br />
One peers up into the breeze-swayed branches<br />
of a Ponderosa pine, one among many<br />
one has arranged oneself under.  Perhaps the wind,<br />
which is easy and warm, dislodged the ant<br />
one swept from one’s ear, meaning<br />
it had fallen many times its height to land there,<br />
in the whorl of the ear of one.  In truth, one wishes<br />
for the tongue of a sylph instead of an ant.  Even two sylphs,<br />
one thinks, though perhaps it is not sylphs one means—<br />
they being invisible spirits of the air—<br />
but rather the slender girls of one’s conjuring.  (One conjures,<br />
one admits.)  Thinking one dead, a deer approaches.<br />
One imagines being a deer, but then one rises<br />
to a seated position, so that the deer will startle<br />
and run.  If only one could run as a deer does.<br />
If one were not so weary, one would that very deer chase<br />
a ways, beguiled by the wave of its white tail.<br />
But no, one is molten.  One seems to have no bones.<br />
One shall not run, not now, nor even rise.<br />
Instead one shall subside to one’s supine pose<br />
and by the sun through the needles of the trees be dappled.<br />
Though of course one should avoid the word dappled.<br />
One knows this.  Yet something about the sun<br />
and the sway of the shadows makes one<br />
larcenous as well as slothful.  And as one acknowledges<br />
one’s Hopkinsian trespass, one notes<br />
perhaps the same sort of finch spoken of<br />
in his poem and sees one’s borrowing as praise.<br />
Of the finch, that is, although it dawns on one<br />
that this particular finch is an American Goldfinch,<br />
and one decides one’s praise is for him instead, the poet.<br />
One feels literary and allusive then.  It seems one’s time<br />
upon one’s back in the woods is not wasted after all.<br />
There is the <em>squeegee-squeegee-squeegee-squeegee</em> song<br />
of the goldfinch.  One is delighted by the nineteen ees<br />
in the preceding line, not one of which has been written,<br />
since one is reclined under the trees<br />
with none of the usual writing implements.  (One counts them<br />
in one’s head and upon one’s fingers instead.)  One’s 1965<br />
Book-of-the-Month Club edition of Fowler’s <em>Modern<br />
English Usage </em>delights one also, though it is a quarter-mile away<br />
and stamped with the name and address of a dead woman<br />
one knew once.  One knew her and she died, and one is glad<br />
to have known her, for she was droll and brilliant,<br />
although one wishes one had known her when she was young.<br />
Once one was young but is no longer,<br />
though one still conjures as if one were—sylphs, women,<br />
the too-soon dead, the chaste and priestly poets of yore.<br />
Otherwise, one does not imagine one is certain of much.<br />
In fact, one is almost asleep, but then a hawk alights<br />
on the limb directly above, a rabbit in its talons.<br />
One’s breath is held.  One perceives the soul<br />
of the rabbit does not abide.  One dares not move,<br />
even though one’s face and white T-shirt<br />
will soon be dappled with the rabbit’s blood.<br />
One imagines.  One thinks of the one one loves<br />
and knows that she will startle<br />
to see one’s bloody face and shirt.<br />
One will stand seemingly wounded and speak to her<br />
of wind and sun, the hawk and its prey, the finch and the deer,<br />
even Fowler (all things whose beauty is past change),<br />
and the one one loves will not understand at first,<br />
when one insists that one must never be<br />
the last one<br />
to die.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> I am a woman; I am a mountain,<br />
I hover over you, a thumb laid<br />
hard across the thickest vein that pulses<br />
fuel down your neck. I’ve locked my knees<br />
beneath oceans, and for nine hours<br />
at a time, I’ve rocked back on your sex,<br />
your hips; I’ve bitten clean through your lip,<br />
and chained you to this chalky wall as skull<br />
and a prick, but you keep on fashioning<br />
this cell for yourself: roof and rib, roof<br />
and rib. And while I clutch your neck<br />
between my tall black boots, blindfolded<br />
and dumbfounded, you’ve the nerve to shine<br />
a lamp in my face and call me <em>mine</em>.<br />
But I’m that peak that does beguile, full<br />
of a darkness that begets your fire<br />
And deep in my womb, where you do sin,<br />
I moan as that little canary<br />
sings. I tell you now I will let blood<br />
flow like water and thicken as mud,<br />
carrying your body off without<br />
guilt, deep in the hole in me you have<br />
built&#8211;filling the fissure, fossilized<br />
in lode, petrified, crushed to coal.</p>

I saw Melvin Wood, The Tree Man, in Mall Mart while I was buying travel size toiletries for my upcoming Cruise to Nowhere. To keep him from seeing <em>me</em>, I turned to the Athletics Cosmetics display, where a holographic image of Amy Knobloch hovered above the four words that had made her famous.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">SINGLE HANDED<br />
NO EXCUSES</p>
<p>Her penalty kick had won the gold medal game at the last Olympics.  She was a local girl, a mass marketer’s dream—an amputee who’d become a world class athlete and a semifinalist on <em>Pole Dancing with the Stars</em>. Marjorie, my wife, had loved her. At the product launch, she’d lined up for an hour to get Amy’s autograph on a giant bottle of shampoo.</p>
<p>But Melvin recognized me from the back, and he tapped me on the forearm with one of his calloused hands. “Mister Breedlove,” he said. “You betaken a trip?”</p>
<p>I told him I’d be driving to Charleston tomorrow morning to begin a five-day Caribbean cruise.  I didn’t say anything about my Hermetic Vacation package.  Melvin had worked outdoors all his life.</p>
<p>“My tree still doing?”  He pronounced it <em>dune</em>.</p>
<p>Right after I met Melvin on jury duty, ten years ago, he’d come out to Belladonna to prune a big pin oak—the one the Owners’ Association swore couldn’t be saved.  Melvin always referred to it as “his” tree.  “Healthy as ever,” I said.</p>
<p>“And how’s the little lady?”</p>
<p>No way out of that one.  Since I’d been working at my insurance agency on that long-ago weekend, Marjorie had greeted Melvin in the driveway.  When he’d told her that the oak didn’t have to come down, that he hated to kill a live tree, that it was like killing one of his own kids (which he didn’t have), Marjorie knew she’d found a kindred spirit.  After he’d spent a whole day with a hand saw and a bucket of tar for the open wounds, she’d run into him, maybe every other month or so, while she was out grocery shopping.  He’d always ask her for an update on “his” tree.</p>
<p>Now I explained that Marjorie had died of a brain aneurysm, and that she’d been planning our forty-fifth anniversary trip for a whole year.  “She was only sixty-eight.”</p>
<p>Melvin took off his PRIME CUTS cap and put it over the pocket of his flannel shirt.   His grizzled beard wobbled with grief.  “Fifty years I been at this job,” he said.  “And she was the only lady ever in-vite me inside her own home, to sit down with her at her kitchen table.”</p>
<p>“She’d want me to take the trip,” I said.  “Especially since she’s already paid for it.”</p>
<p>“Little lady knew the value of a dollar,” Melvin agreed.  He scratched his bare head with his big knuckles.  “Never did see her without no coupon in her hand.”</p>
<p>I took out my Yphone and displayed the virtual discounts for my Homeland Security approved sizes of mouthwash, toothpaste, deodorant, and shaving cream.  After we both managed to laugh, Melvin clapped me lightly on my left shoulder.  He told me to have fun.  He told me we weren’t getting any younger.  No sirree.  He told me to enjoy the fresh air and sunshine while I still could.  “Mister Breedlove,” he said, “you come back here looken like one of them mule-lottos.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>After Marjorie died, nearly half of Belladonna rang my front doorbell with something meant to console me.  Lorene Morrison brought a bouquet of Franken Roses from her late husband’s bushes.  Jorja Sorensen hauled over a lump of Perma-Crete that she claimed was the latest installment in her <em>Gone with the Uterus</em> sculpture series.   Meredith Cotten and Jimmy Scheetz solemnly handed me a voucher for a new mattress pad from Ecumenical Bedding.  Peg Carmichael, the wife of the former Bullpens College athletics director, baked me a sheet cake in the shape of a giant football.  The laces were little crosses of white icing, and above them she’d curlicued  <em>Marjorie 68, Satan 0</em></p>
<p>But I wasn’t in any mood to be consoled.  I put the roses through the Disposall, dropped <em>GWT Uterus</em> and the mattress voucher into the garbage can, and carried the sheet cake into the powder room.  I cut it up into cowflop-size pieces and started counting.  By the last flush, Satan was up by a touchdown and an extra point.</p>
<p>When I opened the bathroom closet to get something to scour the rim of the bowl, I saw one of Marjorie’s Post-Its stuck to the inside of the door.</p>
<p>NO INSURANCE<br />
NO EXCUSES</p>
<p>And then I remembered that the Cruise to Nowhere she’d planned—and paid for— would set sail in a week.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Marjorie was quoting Amy Knobloch to me, even from the grave, because I’d been an insurance man all my working life.  We’d never taken a cruise before, and I hate to leave Greenville, so she’d refused to buy TravelGuard.  “Three drops of rain on the windshield and you’ll cancel, Baron.  I <em>know</em> you.  That’s why I booked with Peregrine.”  She led me by the hand to her laptop computer and showed me the itinerary for the Cruise to Nowhere.  Every day was a FUN DAY AT SEA.  “With the Hermetic Vacation package, you’ll never have to step outside,” she said.  I looked at the web page more carefully:  No ports of call, all-indoor amenities, the same table for every dinner, the same cabin every night.  Same bathroom, same bed, same pillow.  Peregrine even had its own underground parking garage in Charleston, with an umbilical cord leading directly to the ship.  I had to admit that it sounded pretty good.  Risk free.  I mean, how could I object to Nowhere?</p>
<p>Marjorie smiled at me, triumphantly.  “Well?”</p>
<p>I kissed the crown of her head.  “Okie-dokie.”</p>
<p>“Remember, Baron,” she’d said.  “It’s already booked.  And it’s non-refundable.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Well, I’d just see about <em>that</em>.  After I’d cleaned the toilet, I found Peregrine’s toll free number and went to the kitchen phone.  We must be the only people in America who still have a land line.  It took me about ten minutes to hack through the phone tree and get a real person.  I explained the situation and said, “I’m sure you can understand where I’m coming from, Sandy.  I don’t need a cruise at this point in my life.”</p>
<p>“When did she die?” the young woman asked.</p>
<p>“Three weeks ago,” I said.</p>
<p>“Well, you’ve just got to get out there!”</p>
<p>Retired insurance agents don’t surprise easily.  “Indeed.”</p>
<p>“I’m a psychology major,” she said.</p>
<p>For some reason, I told her I’d majored in history.</p>
<p>“Didn’t that get kind of—well, old?”</p>
<p>“No,” I said.  “Not really.”</p>
<p>“Baron, you need the Peregrine experience,” she said.  “No excuses!”</p>
<p>Everyone was quoting Amy Knobloch.  “Can I speak with your supervisor?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” Sandy said.  “But it won’t make any difference.”</p>
<p>And it didn’t.  It was company policy.  He said Peregrine couldn’t possibly fill my cabin five days before a Cruise to Nowhere.  “Even if we—even if <em>you</em>— could find an emergency replacement, there’d be no time for Homeland Security prescreening.”  But he did assure me that I’d have special handling once I was on board.</p>
<p>Special handling.  So, by God, I was going Nowhere whether I liked it or not.  After I slammed down the phone—one of the great advantages of a land line—I saw Marjorie’s oldest, most crinkly Post-It next to our list of emergency numbers.</p>
<p>I WILL CELEBRATE EACH DAY<br />
AND MAKE IT COUNT</p>
<p>I found a fresh Post-It packet and peeled off a new one of my own.</p>
<p>I WILL EXECRATE EACH DAY<br />
AND MAKE THEM PAY</p>
<p>Special handling would have a new meaning in the near future.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>I drove down to Charleston in Marjorie’s old Prius.  What with the Toyota recalls<br />
and those oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico, she’d gotten a great deal by threatening to buy<br />
an ElectroVolt.  Even after a decade of being semi-dependent on fossil fuel, we were still<br />
coming out ahead.</p>
<p>When I pulled into the Peregrine parking garage, MARCUS opened my door and told me he’d take care of my carryon bag.  “We don’t believe in carryon.”  His polished smile against his dark skin was almost blinding, even in fluorescent light.  “We check everything.  I’ll personally see that it gets to your cabin, sir.  After I valet your vehicle.”</p>
<p>I took out my wallet to give him a tip.  My problem was with the company, not with the staff.</p>
<p>“We don’t believe in cash.”  He pointed to his Peregrine nametag.  “We all have a six-character ID.  When you get your BuyPass at boarding, stop at the gratuity kiosk and punch me in.”  His index finger was still underlining his nametag.  “Just remember—MARCUS rhymes with PARKUS.”</p>
<p>“I’ll remember,” I said.</p>
<p>“Let me take that vase,” he said.</p>
<p>“She’s not a vase,” I said, wrapping both my arms around what was left of Marjorie.  “And she comes with me.”</p>
<p>“Good luck,” he said.  “With Homeland Security.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>For my sake, Marjorie had chosen the NASCAR boarding option.  She would’ve preferred Hawaiian Vista or Himalayan View, but she knew I was a big fan.  “And<br />
besides,” she’d said, “our ship holds ten thousand people.  NASCAR gets to board first.”</p>
<p>It made sense to me.</p>
<p>Except for the maze of yellow crime tape to keep us all moving in the right direction, it was like standing in the infield at Darlington or Daytona.  Virtual Fords and Chevvies were racing on the skin of the inner walls, their advertising logos stretched to DayGlo blurs—although the sound was muted, so we could hear any emergency directives from Homeland Security.  It was real enough to make you throw up, and the guy in the Jeff Gordon cap in front of me did.  Fortunately, the Peregrine staff had issued recyclable barf bags at the door.  When I started to get dizzy, I held Marjorie in one hand while I studied my Yphone map of the Peregrine <em>Windhover</em>.</p>
<p>The crew lived on Deck Zero.  The umbilical would lead us directly to Sensorama, one of the main decks. The other one, Panorama, had duty-free shopping and outdoor access.  There were four residence decks.  Circe, for guys who like to party hearty.  Medea, for the families with kids.  I’d be on Tithonus, Deck Five—right below Narcissus, the top deck, with UV-resistant skylights and personal size pools for the young singles.  Then a pop-up ad interrupted my Map App.  <em>Peregrine—All who wander are not lost</em>.  I couldn’t get rid of the damn thing.  I had to turn off my phone.</p>
<p>When I finally arrived at the Homeland Security station, they stopped me before I could enter the full body scan.  “Hey,” I said.  “That’s my wife.”  I showed the agents Marjorie’s passport and the crematorium’s RFID on the underside of the urn, so they let us pass through, together.  But when I came up to the Peregrine counter on the far side, next to the umbilical gangplank, an orange-haired woman older than God wouldn’t let us on the ship.  “We’ll take your hand baggage to your cabin, sir.  As soon as you get your BuyPass.”  I told GRACIE that my wife was a paying passenger—and I showed her the virtual receipt on my Yphone to prove it.  “I want the two BuyPasses she’s bought and paid for,” I said. “One for me, and one for her.”</p>
<p>“That’s not a person,” GRACIE sputtered.</p>
<p>Her supervisor had to commandeer her computer terminal.  Then I walked to the<br />
gratuity kiosk and tipped MARCUS five bucks—on my BuyPass.  GRACIE got a<br />
virtual nickel—on Marjorie’s.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>My carryon was waiting for me at my cabin, with a special consideration bracelet that entitled me to unlimited free drinks—and to senior singles dining, rather than Tithonus for Two.  After I unpacked, I tucked Marjorie into the closet across from the bathroom door.  She always seemed to like closets, especially when she felt hopelessly, helplessly mad at something.  Room service brought me a bottle of champagne, which I promptly popped and poured down the toilet.  After I flushed forty-five times, I ran both the sink and the shower full force in the tiny bathroom.  Sitting on the edge of the king size bed, I could imagine I was living next to a pair of malfunctioning deepwater drilling rigs—the Peregrine spills, draining the Peregrine corporate coffers!  Compensation!  Then I settled down for a nap before dinner.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>On the Tithonus Deck, you really couldn’t tell if the ship was moving.  The virtual window in my cabin had no curtains, just a remote control.  I had always assumed that the Cruise to Nowhere went <em>somewhere</em>, if only in circles, but maybe the <em>Windhover</em> could wallow in port and save fuel.  At some point, I’d have to go to the Panorama Deck and step outside, to see if we’d actually left the harbor.</p>
<p>I was a late arrival at senior singles.  They’d put me at a round table for eight, with plenty of room for wide bodies and wheelchair access.  JIMSKI had already taken orders for appetizers, and he handed me an ivory menu right away, so I could catch up.  I told him I wanted two.</p>
<p>“Which?”  He pronounced it to rhyme with <em>beach</em>.</p>
<p>“Two <em>menus</em>,” I said.  “One for me, and one for my wife.”  I placed Marjorie’s urn to the left of my water glass.  “A chair for the lady, please.”</p>
<p>JIMSKI knitted his black, woolly eyebrows and led me to the maitre d’s station, where I flashed Marjorie’s BuyPass.  After consulting his virtual manifest, the maitre d’ dragged a chair from a vacant table and begged my pardon.  JIMSKI settled Marjorie into her seat and propped a menu between her urn and the lacy hem of the tablecloth.</p>
<p>By this time, all the appetizers had arrived, but no one was left to eat them—except for one woman, on the far side of the table.  She looked like Jackie Kennedy before she got cancer.  Only with curly hair.  With her left cheek angled in my direction, she was giving me a smirk that could’ve been Photoshopped from the Mona Lisa.</p>
<p>I looked down at my menu and said, “My wife and I will be having the lobster bisque.” JIMSKI leaned in towards my ear, then pointed to the urn.  “Does she tip?”  He pronounced it to rhyme with <em>sheep</em>.</p>
<p>“Of course,” I said.  “What happened to the other senior singles?”</p>
<p>“They leave for open dining.  Not to be coming back.  They say you are one French fry short of Happy Meal.”</p>
<p>Jackie Kennedy was still halfway smiling, but she hadn’t said a word.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>At 7:30 A.M. I called room service for a full American breakfast.   Everything but my bagel and black coffee got flushed.  After I turned off the sink and the shower, which I’d kept running all night—I didn’t want my towel steward getting suspicious—I took the elevator down to Sensorama.  The videos hadn’t started yet.  Our cruise director, RYAN01, stood center stage, spotlighted, in the middle of his introductory spiel.</p>
<p>“How many of you blokes are from Indiana?  California?  The Rockies?  New York?  New England?  The Land of Dixie?”  For the first time, there was more than a smattering of applause.  “Can you squeal like a pig for me?”</p>
<p>Somebody obliged.</p>
<p>“All right!”  RYAN01 rubbed his hand over his blond crew cut.  “When I worked in Australia, I’d always ask about other countries, but this is the Cruise <em>to</em> Nowhere!  Not the Cruise <em>from</em> Nowhere!”</p>
<p>Now everybody was cheering.</p>
<p>“How many of you are ready for your Hermetic Vacation?  How many of you All Americans are <em>pumped</em>?”</p>
<p>“USA!  USA!  USA!  USA!”</p>
<p>It was enough to make me nostalgic for Barack Obama.</p>
<p>“The first stop on your Hermetic Vacation will be . . . Jamaica!   And remember, blokes, I’m RYAN01!  And I accept gratuities!”</p>
<p>When the lights dimmed, we were docking in Ocho Rios.  The deep blue harbor shimmered in the dawn sun, without an oil slick in sight.  Green hills beckoned in the distance.</p>
<p>On the cab ride to Prospect Plantation, a legless beggar waved at us from the curb.  When he opened his mouth to speak, half of his front teeth were missing.</p>
<p>“Where are his six characters?”  the woman in front of me whispered.  “I can’t see his six characters!”</p>
<p>At the plantation, we took a jitney ride through sugar cane, pineapples, and banana trees.  When the dirt road began to get rougher, my seat began to shake.</p>
<p>“That is what we call the Jamaican massage!”  said RUPERT, our digital tour guide.  He wore loose tribal pants and no shirt.  After he hopped down from the front of the jitney, we watched him climb a coconut tree.  It slanted about thirty degrees from the perpendicular, so he could walk up with his bare feet while he wrapped his hands around the other side of the trunk and leaned back, straight as a telephone pole, extending his black arms.</p>
<p>I remember hoping he had good insurance. At the top, when he took both hands off the tree to pick a coconut, RUPERT plummeted into a cartoony, multicolored cushion made from his six Peregrine characters. Everybody laughed, including RUPERT.  “Me bad, man!”</p>
<p>He pronounced it <em>bod</em>.</p>
<p>The ride back to the harbor featured a terrorist ambush and three IEDs.  At that point, I gave up on Sensorama.  Two college kids from the Circe Deck were slouching next to the open door, swilling beer, even though it wasn’t even 10 A.M. yet.  Their Peregrine specialty T-shirts read DRINK, PISS, REPEAT.</p>
<p>I heard an enormous explosion behind me.</p>
<p>“Hey, this is awesome, man.”  Their brown bottles clinked together.  “It’s like being in the middle of a suicide bombing!”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Jackie Kennedy’s name was Gabriella.  On the second night of the cruise, we were sitting alone at our table, if you didn’t count Marjorie.  When I tried to start a conversation, she shook her head sadly.  “No English.  Italiano.”</p>
<p>I have to admit I felt relieved.  “No Italiano.  English.”</p>
<p>Then she pointed to Marjorie’s ashes, and then to me, and finally to her own heart. “Yes,” I said, nodding vertically, in what I hoped was a universal gesture.  “I do love my wife.”</p>
<p>Now she pointed to the FrankenShrimp on her plate, licked her glossy lips, and circled her other hand in front of the bodice of her black dress.</p>
<p>I tried not to stare at her stunning cleavage.  “Yes, the food here is very good.”  I rubbed my own tummy.  “Yum.”</p>
<p>While we were waiting for the crème brulée, she took a Yphone out of her tiny purse.  To give her some privacy—how could she know I <em>really</em> didn’t speak Italian?—I stood up to go to the rest room.  A moment later, my own phone began to trill.</p>
<p>“Yes?”  I said.</p>
<p>Now I heard a digitized female voice.  “I speak Italian.  You speak English.  Are you understanding this?”</p>
<p>I turned back to my senior singles table and saw her Mona Lisa.  She must have the Yphone Plus, with the proximity function and the Instant Translation App.  “Okie-dokie,” I said.</p>
<p>She blinked her big eyelashes.  “Please try again.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said.  I wondered how I sounded in her own language.  “I am understanding this.”</p>
<p>“Good.  My name is Gabriella.  What is your name?”</p>
<p>Now I spoke directly across the table, not into the Yphone.  I didn’t think I should trust her software on this one.</p>
<p>“Breed Love.”  Her slight smile widened for the first time.</p>
<p>“My last name.”  I was speaking into my phone again.  “What is your last name?”</p>
<p>“I am a woman,” I heard.  “It changes.”</p>
<p>Our desserts arrived.  The caramelized crust was so good that I ate Marjorie’s<br />
portion as well as my own.  When I finished, I said, “Where is the rest of our table?” Gabriella tilted her head and lifted the linen next to her water glass, baring the faux rosewood beneath.  Then she shrugged, extending both open palms toward the ceiling.</p>
<p>I decided to try again.  “Where did the other people at our table go?”</p>
<p>She half-stifled a snicker, which I wish she hadn’t done, because I’d like to have heard what a Yphone Plus would do with a snicker.  “I hope they will go buying some shoes.”</p>
<p>Except for Gabriella, every senior single I’d seen so far waddled around in flip-flops or sneakers.  “Walruses don’t wear shoes,” I said.</p>
<p>This time, Gabriella covered her mouth with both hands.  Then she said something that came through my earpiece as “That is not nice.  But that is true.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>After dinner, I returned to my cabin to practice for Senior Karaoke.  The <em>Morning Memo to Our Most Seasoned Cruisers</em> had included a list of the featured songs—“just in case the words changed since the last time you heard them!!!”  I decided to pass on <em>Margaritaville</em>, <em>Love Me Tender</em>, <em>When I’m 64</em>, and <em>My Heart Will Go On</em>.  I’d be performing <em>Mister Lonely</em>.</p>
<p>I wrote out my customized lyrics on the backside of the <em>Morning Memo</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Truly<br />
Peregrine screwed me<br />
They kept her deposit<br />
When my wife died<br />
She paid for our passage<br />
She prepaid our passage<br />
When I asked for a refund<br />
I was promptly denied<br />
So now I’m nowhere<br />
On The Cruise to Nowhere<br />
Away from home<br />
Through no wish of my own<br />
That’s why I’m lonely<br />
I’m Mister Lonely<br />
This fucking cruise line has no soul</p></blockquote>
<p>Because there were no <em>A</em>’s with guts enough to go up to the front of the Tithonus Lounge, Mister Baron Breedlove was performing first.  A hundred geezers sat in the audience, half of them in wheelchairs.  There was one kid, in her twenties maybe, with the biggest incisors I’d ever seen.  I figured she was somebody’s granddaughter.</p>
<p>The DJ handed me a cordless mic and asked me if I wanted to increase the font size of Bobby Vinton’s lyrics on the teleprompter.</p>
<p>“No thanks,” I said.</p>
<p>He told me to suit myself, and he started the music.  Not that there’s very much music in those early 60s tearjerkers—just a few humming violins and a snare drum that could put you to sleep.  When I finished, he said, “Sir, you might want the bigger letters next time.”</p>
<p>I was still receiving polite applause from everybody who could move both hands.  “Don’t believe everything you read,” I said, returning the mic.  “Especially if it’s on a screen.”  He handed me a souvenir CD so I could relive my celebrity experience forever.  “If you’d like a digitally enhanced video in a Peregrine carrying case,” he said, “you can put it on your BuyPass.  Of course, it’ll mean some extra work for me.”  Then he whispered, “It’s something we Afrikaners are used to.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, BIGMIX,” I said.  “You’re a man of characters.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>I spent most of the next day on the Promenade Deck.  It would’ve been the perfect vacation for Marjorie—almost as big as Mall Mart, but with exotic specialty stores and no groceries to worry about.  I tried to find the jewelry boutique on my own, since I hate to ask for directions, but I finally had to go to a kiosk for a shopping consultant.  “I’m looking for a forty-fifth anniversary present,” I said.</p>
<p>“We keep the good stuff in back.”  She offered her bony elbow and waited for me to take it. “For a more personalized experience.”  Then she escorted me to a door marked AUTHORIZED SHOPPERS ONLY.</p>
<p>TIFF01 had that elegant, half-starved look that other women seem to envy.  I told her she was the first Peregrine crew member I’d met from my own country.  “Yes,” she said.  “They save most of us for the upscale shopping.  It helps Americans to relate.  I mean, you buy <em>postcards</em> from Panamanians.  Not Porsches.”</p>
<p>She was leading me past illuminated display cases of designer watches, wedding rings, engagement rings, earrings, toe rings, nose rings, navel rings, charm bracelets, pendants, and pins.  “I don’t see any Porsches,” I said.</p>
<p>“I have the authority to sell anything.  If you don’t see it here, I can get it for you in three days.  Duty free.  Anything.  Including the ship.”</p>
<p>I told her I wanted a nice necklace for my wife.  Nothing but the best.  That she deserved a nice surprise, for a change.</p>
<p>“The Heart of the Ocean.”  Her deep, hollow eyes took on a strange glow. “Would you prefer the standard cubic zirconia or an exact replica of the blue diamond?”</p>
<p>“What’s the difference?”</p>
<p>“About 25K.”</p>
<p>I asked her to show me both.  I couldn’t tell them apart.</p>
<p>“She will.  Take my word for it.”  TIFF01 draped the exact replica lovingly around her long neck and kissed the blue stone.  Her scarlet lipstick didn’t leave a smudge.  “Anybody gives me one of <em>these</em>, he gets the key to <em>my</em> cabin.  Even if he’s from Circe.  And believe me, those guys are animals.”</p>
<p>“Is it insured?”</p>
<p>“For the cruise.  After that, you’re on your own.”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t anybody say they just lost it?  And hide it in their luggage before we get back to Charleston?”</p>
<p>TIFF01 laughed.  “They can try.  But there’s an indelible electronic tag on all of our merchandise.  You couldn’t get it through the scanners even if you ate it.”</p>
<p>While she was verifying the credit limit on my BuyPass she said, “Better get ready for a long night, Leo.”</p>
<p>I told her my name was Baron.</p>
<p>“Not tonight it isn’t.”  She told me the usual gratuity on high end jewelry was five percent— six, for exceptional service.</p>
<p>“Well, I think you’re exceptional,” I said.</p>
<p>“You are such a dear man.  Just make sure you enter Tiff Zero One at the kiosk.”  She placed the necklace into a velvet Peregrine case, and she lowered her voice to a hard whisper.  “Tiff Zero Two is a real bra breaker.  Even worse than my sister.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>After another Yphone dinner with Gabriella, I decided to take Marjorie down to the Promenade Deck.  She would have wanted us to go outside at least <em>once</em>.</p>
<p>The airlock loomed at the stern of the ship.  NON-CLIMATE CONTROLLED AREA.  UNSECURED PETROCHEMICAL VAPORS.  The door was that gunmetal gray I’d seen on submarines in the movies.  You had to insert your BuyPass over the handle and sign an electronic waiver before it’d budge.  When it did, I was hit by a blast of hot, humid air that smelled like an old garage.</p>
<p>The balcony was narrow, but it ran the whole width of the ship.  The <em>Windhover</em> had indeed left Charleston harbor.  While I stood at the railing and swiveled my head, horizon to horizon, I could see only open ocean.  When I looked straight down, the ship’s wake was churning up white in the moonlight, with little rainbow flecks on the outer edges.  I wondered if it was all water, but I inhaled deeply anyway.  Marjorie would have wanted me to inhale.</p>
<p>Marjorie had been adventurous.  Not like me.  After all those miscarriages, she would’ve been willing to try again—even though the doctors had told us she’d be taking a big chance.  One summer, while she was off with her mother on a bed-and-breakfast tour of the Blue Ridge Mountains, I had a vasectomy.  I never told her about it.</p>
<p>“You were right, Marjorie,” I said aloud.  “About the Hermetic Vacation.”</p>
<p>But I knew if she’d been planning a vacation just for herself, she’d have done things differently.  Marjorie always liked to take things into her own hands.  If she hadn’t spoken to me first, at college, we’d never even have met.  Years later, after she’d finally given up on the idea of having a family, I wondered whether she’d started hard-core couponing because she felt cheated—by everyone and everything around her.  Because she was tired of paying and paying, because she wanted the world to give her something back, because she was trying to get even.  And, by God, because she was damn good at it.</p>
<p>I took the necklace out of my pocket and dropped it into the urn.  “Happy anniversary, honey.”</p>
<p>I heard a gasping sob.  When I spun around to face the airlock, the door was still latching.<br />
I took Marjorie back inside and used my BuyPass to check the log of electronic signatures.  There wasn’t much to read.  The only other name was Winifred Poogan.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>On the last evening of my Cruise to Nowhere, Gabriella brought Captain Caravaggio Cupisti to our dinner table.  He was a tall man, neither young nor old, with the kind of slicked-back hair you only saw in the movies.  Except for his missing cap, he was in full uniform, with gold braiding on his broad, padded shoulders.</p>
<p>After she whispered some Italian into his ear, he said, “I am coming here, Baron Breedlove, to renew your wedding vows, and this lovely lady will assist me.”  JIMSKI picked up Marjorie’s urn from its customary place at the table, and he handed it to Gabriella.  While the wheelchairs and walkers gathered around us, Gabriella stood next to me, but she didn’t say a word.  Up close she looked older than Marjorie, older than me, with an ancient scar on her cheek.  But she was wearing white, and she had remarkable posture.  And, at precisely the right moment, she gave me my bride, and she began the applause.  Captain Caravaggio Cupisti shook my hand and said “<em>Signore</em>” before leaving.  Since none of his names had six characters, I figured he didn’t expect to be tipped.</p>
<p>After the cherries jubilee, when Gabriella rose from the table, she pressed a tiny red pouch, with a silver drawstring, into my left hand.  “You will need this, Baron Breed Love.  But you will not see me again.”</p>
<p>I was so shocked to hear her speak English that I didn’t even ask her why not.  When I loosened the drawstring of the pouch, I saw a pair of sterling silver earrings in the shape of tiny high-heeled shoes.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>We docked in Charleston the next morning, but there was a final breakfast— with open seating, in the Tithonus dining room—for anyone who didn’t have early travel connections.  Marjorie wasn’t with me, and she wasn’t with my luggage, either, which I’d already entrusted to MARCUS.  I’d decided to leave her—and her new necklace—in my cabin, facing the virtual window, with the Peregrine sticker from the jewelry box over the label from the crematorium.  Marjorie had always wanted to travel.  With any luck, the stewards would figure she was part of the room.  I read somewhere that Peregrine made every cabin unique.  And if anyone tried to take her from the <em>Windhover</em>, an electronic alarm would go off, and I’d be duly notified.</p>
<p>I hadn’t yet decided whether I’d report the necklace as missing.  25K is a lot of money, but I had to admit I was feeling better than five days ago.  SINGLE HANDED.  NO EXCUSES.  Maybe Amy Knobloch was right.</p>
<p>JIMSKI brought out a simple Continental breakfast—one for me, and one for Marjorie.   After spelling out his six-character ID—twice—he told me he was going on shore leave just as soon as he got out of his uniform.</p>
<p>He wished me and my wife a good trip home. While I was sipping my coffee, a young woman asked if she could join me.  She had the kind of face that would’ve looked adorable on a five-year-old but seemed faintly ridiculous on an adult.</p>
<p>“I think they’ve stopped serving,” I said.</p>
<p>“Just to sit,” she said.  “If you don’t mind.”</p>
<p>I pointed to Marjorie’s untouched breakfast.  “It’s a shame to have this go to waste, honey.”</p>
<p>While we were eating, she told me she’d been staying on the Narcissus Deck.</p>
<p>“I never went up there,” I said.</p>
<p>She grimaced.  “You wouldn’t like it.  Nobody cares about anybody.  All they did was, like, stare into the pool.  They hardly ever talked to each other.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” I said.  “But at least you got a good tan.”</p>
<p>“It’s fake.  Peregrine just doctors the Jacuzzis.”  She grimaced again, like a toddler with indigestion.  “Let’s face it.  I look like a chipmunk who’s been dropped in a vat of milk chocolate.  And just look at my teeth.”</p>
<p>I’d seen those teeth before—at Senior Karaoke.</p>
<p>“Everybody on Narcissus was getting theirs bleached.”  She drew back her lower lip, so her incisors seemed even longer than they really were.  “The Color Me Beautiful package.”</p>
<p>“They are very—white,” I said.</p>
<p>Now she started crying, with the racking, shoulder-wrenching sobs of a child.  “Please stop that,” I said.  “Please.  Stop.”  But she couldn’t.  I started thinking about that self-made waterfall in my own cabin, five days’ worth of sopping towels, the urn I’d left behind.  Marjorie would have wanted me to do something.  To give her something.  I couldn’t leave her like this.  But she didn’t have six characters, and she couldn’t stop crying.  So I finally reached into my pocket, and I took out Gabriella’s tiny shoes.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let me tell you bout my boy, she says, the way they do, the gnarled walnut knuckles working like the gnarled walnut of their cheeks swollen with that pride that slows her speech from the gallop it also wants her to take. But let me tell you, she says behind eyes dream ridden, about my boy, my boy’s boy, she means, her grandson, he’s the grandest thing she’s ever seen. Can play ball all day and not be too tired to watch her roll the biscuit in the shack of a kitchen out behind the shanty they inhabit, the flour powdering the cutting board, the floorboards when she sighs too hard. And he does well enough at school though those books fall apart at the spine and the mouse gnaws the corners where they’re stored back in the schoolhouse over summers, summers when he picks her a long stemmed weed that flowers and brings it to her from beside the road where he walks in the ditch when a car comes, well into the ditch because you never know who’s boiling the dust down that road, could be anybody, but he brings the flower with white petals dust speckled. And the little girls like him because his cocoa skin comes over those cheekbones that must owe something to that Cherokee down the line before they all moved north back in the day, the one with the ebony hair long past his shoulders that they had a tintype of once long ago but it warped and peeled in one fire or another. Noble looking man without a wrinkle round his squinting eyes. Whatever happened to him. But it’s that boy she wants to speak of, her boy’s boy, so lively and quick limbed, a caution with his bright eyes that grin though there’s a tooth missing from where that white grocerman kicked him at the fair. And he grows fine and tall and lone pine straight and when the war brings his turn he signs for the army and he’s in Ohio and New Jersey and then over there in France and Italy and she doesn’t know where all and when he comes home there’s a parade for them, for the black boys who went by the train from their side the tracks, a parade down their unpaved street and they’re all so sharp in those uniforms with the razored line in the pants legs all marching to time despite the dust to the flag whapping in the breeze at the head of the column and he’s got a medal on his pocket but when they try to describe to her what it’s for she has a hard time breathing it in because that world aint her world and never will be and she’s mostly glad and sleepy. So pretty soon he’s got him a girl of course and he’s so good he’s only got the one girl though the way they talk he could have them all, that gone tooth don’t matter to his smile, and then he’s got a boy of his own and that boy plays ball too in the pasture he’s let to play in with the other boys south of Main and that boy too has those same Cherokee cheekbones thank Lord that will mark him out as the envy of girls and not take after his mama who runs around but this boy, this newest one, the littlest one, her great grandson, four generations to account for now before you can fall asleep good, also brings her a flower from side the road, the same white weed that leans into the barbed wire and so gets protected from the mash of cattle and feeds on the lush water from the ditch when it rains and she squints at him there bringing her his flower in a hand palsied like hers only he never does because that boy she wants to tell you about in the beginning, her only grandboy, was never born at all except in the womb of sleep she sobs to wake from because his father, her own first boy that she fetched in her belly through ten moons and yet another winter rich with cold suds and bleached wash, never grew up to sire her any kin because one night while he was twenty during what they called the Red Summer of 1919 when the devils broke with hell after that first war and everone of them was stalking streets for Bolsheviks and work that there wasn’t enough of to go round he was hauled from the jailhouse (where they said he’d raped a white woman which he never did) and strung at the lamppost and burned alive with a chest full of lead over a pile of lumber and if you go back into the stacks of that yellow newspaper you can see his body still for yourself lying in a state of flames, the sphere of the skull fired clean of features, the broiled torso glowing in black and white, the legs or what’s left of them melting into the wreckage of the fire, it’s all there, the posers with hands on hips and grinning cigarettes, gawkers in good hats and even a laughing woman in a belted coat making the background of the night lit by the pyre of her boy’s body, her boy slowly refined into the night of his execution when she can’t sleep and for what.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Somewhere between McCook and the grid of rural routes she had traveled to reach the farm, Letty had applied a coat of lipstick. She liked to drive with the window down, her hand pressed flat against the wind. Now her skin was coated with a fine layer of dust, her red-pink mouth, glazed with grit.</p>
<p>Because her work sometimes required her to interview a male sheriff or mechanic or bartender, Letty wore a fly-fisherman&#8217;s vest over an ankle-length skirt. A hand-sized spiral notebook fit neatly inside one of the pockets. Later, in the air-conditioned drug store down the street from the room she rented at the Moore Motel or, sometimes, there and then on the side of the road, she recorded her observations. The condition of the house. The number of dogs. The demeanor of the children, watching from behind screens.</p>
<p>She didn’t like interviews. She didn’t like that she could make people say things they&#8217;d want to take back. Which they always did.</p>
<p><em> Read it out</em>, a voice would whine into a payphone receiver. Letty would pull the curtain away from the window and stare at the telephone wires strung between the poles across the street.  <em>I may have exaggerated that part about the little girl left for so long in the cellar.  What&#8217;s the harm in reading what you wrote?  </em></p>
<p>Letty&#8217;s skirt swung as she crossed the gravel road that seemed to disappear in a pool of watery light. She felt the brush of the hem against her ankles, the rush of air, high between her legs, and then, as if she’d been hit with a stone, the girl&#8217;s gaze struck.</p>
<p>Her bare feet scuffed at the powdery dust beneath the bottom strand of the barbed wire fence. Her shirtwaist dress was unbuttoned at the collar.  The design was flowers.  Dark-centered, round-petaled flowers. And though the collar was white, and the sleeves were trimmed in white, the front of the dress was smeared with grime, as if she’d been inching her way beneath the front porch or lying face down on the back of a horse.</p>
<p>Behind her stood an empty water trough. Farther back, in the shade of an oak, the house. Letty noted the storm windows of a root cellar in the foundation. The axe in the stump of a tree. A door squeaked open on a rusty hinge. Behind the screen, a woman watched Letty approach the girl with her hand on the fence.</p>
<p>The first time Letty spoke to the girl, she was standing outside the video arcade next door to the Rexall drugstore, where she went after work to transcribe her notes into reports. It was air conditioned. There was a soda fountain.  The counter was usually empty, evenings.</p>
<p>The girl told Letty that her parents were migrant workers, but she lived with a foster mother west of McCook. The social worker who had taken her there said she ran a horse farm, though it hadn’t taken but a day to find out there weren’t any horses any more.</p>
<p>Letty and the girl developed a vague relationship after that. Sometimes the girl missed the bus after school and spent the afternoon in the video arcade, waiting for her foster mother’s brother to finish his shift at the Conoco station at the end of the block. If Letty saw her through the window, she’d wave. The girl would come out, and they’d go inside the Rexall where Letty would buy her a Coke.</p>
<p>The girl sat across from her in the booth, sipping from two straws.  Sometimes they exchanged a few words. Mostly they exchanged looks. In any case, Letty looked at the girl, interpreting what she could from the circles beneath her eyes. The scattering of blemishes across her forehead. The blunt-cut hair that fell unevenly from a zig-zag part to her chin.</p>
<p>Sometimes Letty gave her coins to put in the miniature jukebox soldered to the wall above the table.  The girl turned the frames, reading the titles of the out-dated 45s handwritten on labels glued to the racks. She liked a song called “Ode to Billie Joe.” Letty watched her scratching the wax paper cup of melting ice with a dirty fingernail, mouthing the words<em>,</em> and handed her a business card embossed with her name and title. Field Agent. Child Protective Services. McCook, Nebraska. The girl’s thumb grazed the raised letters.</p>
<p>“Give it back a minute.” Letty printed a phone number on the back. “This is where I stay. This is where you can find me.”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t matter. She don’t let me use the telephone.”</p>
<p>The woman at the top of the stairs wore a checked apron tied at the waist, and, beneath the apron, a tea-length dress, also checked, but a different print from the apron. Landowner. Letty saw it in the fit of her dress. In the way her bare legs in the low-heeled pumps that were wrong for the landscape possessed the floor.</p>
<p>The girl flinched when the screen door slammed. The woman called out from the top of the stairs, and then she was walking toward the fence.</p>
<p>Letty reached for the notebook inside her vest pocket and drew the pen out from under the rubber band that held it closed. She pulled the cap off with her teeth, and, in a scrawl she hoped the girl could read, scribbled the telephone number on a page she ripped from the binder.</p>
<p>The girl held Letty’s eyes for a second before she let go of the fence and ran toward the house.</p>
<p>The woman caught the girl by the wrist, unfolded her fingers, and crushed Letty’s number in the palm of her hand.</p>
<p>Half skipping, half running, the girl followed, led like a goat on a rope. Just before they reached the stairs, she peered over her shoulder and raised her hand behind her back. A furtive farewell, Letty thought. Then her teeth broke into a smile, and the business card wagged between her fingers like a tail.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/05/Hollmeyer_IceRiver5.mp3">Hollmeyer_IceRiverHistoryMuseum</a></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;"> Dot hobbled along with her walker, making apologies for moving slow since her fall. The docent asked what happened, and she explained about the dark cat in the dark hallway. Then she pointed at his ankle and asked <em>him </em>what happened. He adjusted his pants leg so it covered the monitoring device. A dark man in a dark alley, he said.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The docent paused at the first room and held out his hand. This is what a nun’s room looked like. Here’s where she kept her vows. Here’s her bed, her bible, the sink where she splashed water on her face.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Dot and her daughter Mary stood in the doorway, feeling the thickness of the barrier rope against their shins.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">And here’s what their chapel looked like. Here’s a pew, a kneeler, an altar.<span>  </span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">This here is the religious artifacts room. The docent gestured to a headless mannequin modeling a faded habit. A forest of crucifixes grew around her.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">And the last room is the biggest one. The collected curios of Ice River’s residents. There was no rope here, so Dot and Mary stepped inside and followed the docent toward the doll collection.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">These are some of the finest porcelain dolls in the world, the docent said.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I used to have one just like that, Dot said, pointing to the one with chipped lips.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">They wandered among bookshelves stacked high with old photo albums, paperweight fetishes and a small herd of taxidermy — pheasants, mostly. There was Celia Smith’s candlestick collection, still dripped full of wax, and Thelma Logan’s wigs on plastic heads. She was the mayor’s mistress in the fifties, the docent said.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Yes, I knew her, Dot said. She lumbered ahead with her walker, past the record collections and on to the display of Patty Singleton’s crystal Christmas ornaments. I knew her, too, Dot said. She was a real bitch.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Mary didn’t think her mother was capable of saying that word — especially in a holy place, or a place that used to be holy.</p>
<p style="line-height: normal;">            Dot moved on, pushing past the docent. Here they are, she said, stopping mid-stride so that Mary nearly ran up on her heels. My elephants. A typed card taped to the shelf explained that there were a hundred and seventy-eight of them, made of ivory and wood and stone and brass and jewels.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“These are <em>yours?</em>” Mary asked.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Well, my goodness,” the docent said. “Thank you for your generosity.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“You never asked if I wanted any of these,” Mary said.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Because you don’t,” Dot said. “They only have meaning for me. When I worked at the embassy, I had friends from India and Africa and all over Asia, and they sent them for me to remember them by. But they’re all dead now.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I don’t think our donors have ever come in here. They’re usually dead, too,” the docent said. “We should interview you for the newsletter about the work you did.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Interview my daughter,” Dot said. “See if she can even tell you.”<span>  </span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I wouldn’t know what to say,” Mary said. “I’m still trying to figure out why you gave all these to a stranger instead of your only daughter.” She was staring at the leg where the docent wore his monitor.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Dot pulled a small white elephant from the back of a shelf. “Here. This one is for you.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Mary turned the misshapen lump in her hand. “Great. Thanks.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“See, you don’t know the value of anything. That piece is pure ivory. It’s three thousand years old.” Dot turned to the docent. “Bet you didn’t know that, did you?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">He turned red, as though he’d been caught stealing.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Mary looked the elephant in its dull eye and tried to imagine what it had seen in its long life that started before there was a difference between things that are holy and things that are not. But she couldn’t see that far, couldn’t see beyond this day, this walker plodding ahead of her, this handbag into which she dropped the elephant among the things that matter.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href='http://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/05/Althousefinal.mp3'>Althouse: Goran Holds His Breath</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The birds on the water have not heard him yet. Once they do they will burst upwards in flight and he will press the trigger. A gaggle of nine geese, necks huddled, drifts near the opposite bank. For a second the old farmer smells stuffed-goose, roasted on a spit. He kneads feathers on his fingers from cleaning past kills. The illusions—a warm fire, the taste of hot wine, the shelter of his chair after a good meal—are seductive. But he will not aim at the birds.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">At home he has the spit ready behind the kitchen, the fire set. His wife, Ingrid, assembled all the materials for a fruit and chestnut stuffing—twelve ounces of pitted prunes, an orange, six apples and a dozen chestnuts. She left these foods out on the kitchen counter as they agreed—for proof it was an accident when the police question him.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Goran Pettersson points the rifle away from the geese and looks again into the scope. Across the lake, still as glass, a doe stretches her neck toward the sky. The old farmer sees her ears pivoting, detecting. But he will not aim at the deer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The birds on the water have not heard him yet. The rifle is hard against his shoulder, the smell of metal burns his throat, and a rain of tears drowns his jaw. Goran does not want to enter his next minute. So he holds his breath.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Ingrid stands several yards ahead of him on the brown grassy slope of the hill where the birds will fly when they launch. She leans against her walking stick. She is as motionless as the doe, but is looking away toward the horizon where the sun begins to light. Goran turns the rifle toward her. In the scope he sees the long braid of her gray hair magnified, like a woven afghan—shades of silver, gray, ash blonde, white. He feels its familiar windings slide across his hand, from the thousand times he’s pulled her toward him.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">She is ten years older and from the beginning he always did what she said. Some called her bossy, but he never minded her ways. He knew he was prone to temper, easy to rile if things weren’t as expected, impatient around children. It was her decision not to have any. When they were younger and her father eventually died from the plaques and tangles in his brain, they began talking of their own deaths—in theory. One afternoon on a picnic, after wild loving on that same grassy hill—in the hour afterwards when he was always so grateful and would say yes to anything she asked—he had agreed to save her the agony of a long dying.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Now she stands there, watching the sun rise, trusting him completely.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The weight of the promise he made cuts into his spine. When the gun fires he fears his body will split, like a tree fractured in its fall.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Finally, he has to breathe. His exhale rustles the long grass where he stands.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The birds on the water blast off.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">But he lowers the rifle.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">When he does not fire, Ingrid turns, braces against her stick, and looks at Goran. After a while she shuffles down the hill toward him. He is afraid of her stare as she advances, that he has failed her, failed in his promise. He feels sweat run down his side, making his chambray shirt damp under his coat. His knees turn pliant and his lungs ache with the shame that has settled on him.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">But she walks past. Her eyes gaze blank, two holes in her face. She has forgotten why they came.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">He does not know what to do so he goes about his day. He mends the fence by the garden, sweeps the chicken pen, and picks ripe tomatoes for dinner salad. Sometimes, since he sold his cropland, keeping only his house and the property by the lake, he has to search for things to occupy his time. He does his chores slowly so they will last longer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">From outside he observes Ingrid through the windows. She passes back and forth behind the glass inside each room. He knows she will dust first and then vacuum. Sometimes, forgetting, she will dust again, starting over.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">They roast a chicken for dinner. He makes the stuffing. Afterwards they sit with coffee mugs at the bare kitchen table in their two straight-back chairs while the sun descends, darkening the room about them. Her hand lies still on the table top. He cups his hand over hers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Many mornings pass. Every morning Ingrid asks to walk to the lake.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">This new morning the birds on the water do not hear him yet. The birds on the water might be the same geese, older, or they might be descended from last year’s goslings or they might be new birds, just landed. The deer’s ears pivot in the scope, or it might be a jack rabbit with a twitching nose, or it might be a bob cat, still as a stone, anticipating prey. The rifle is the same rifle and it is loaded. Goran puts his finger gently on the trigger.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">His wife stands several yards ahead of him on the brown grassy slope of the hill. She is the same wife, but she is not the same wife.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The birds on the water have not heard him yet. He does not want to enter his next minute, or the next, <a name="_GoBack"></a>or the next. So Goran holds his breath.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong> &#8220;Permian Flats&#8221; was runner-up in the 2nd annual Bevel Summers Prize for the Short Story.</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>It had taken them three days to find the Spragg boy. A migrant worker heading to Permian Flats had found the abandoned truck out past Crooked Creek where the road sloped down and away from the pasture of feed grass. An hour or so later the group of searchers found the body lain out beside a great rent in the earth. A deputy later told us at the Blue Hat that down in there was a storm of hot slag flung up beneath the soil. Said that it reeked of bad things. Another man said that he could see the fiery glow from the top of Elk Butte where he had been trailing wolves for the state. A few of the boys finished their beers when they heard this and left their frothy bottles along the bar so they could drive out to find it. I watched them go and finished my own drink. The bar was mostly empty now and the silence sobered me. Although I was also curious I ended up driving over to Enterprise to see Amaya instead. She heated up some cold pork and rice and I ate them in corn tortillas and had another beer as I told her about what the deputy had said. It was a strange thing to talk about. Of otherworldly gashes in the earth and of the way it so easily killed. Of things one could not explain. Amaya crossed herself and put her small hand there on my chest as we sat on the couch together with the lights off and an afghan around us for warmth.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>­–Lo siento por la familia, she told me.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>–Me too, I agreed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span><span> </span>The next morning I took Amaya with me when I drove out with the others. There was a line of pickup trucks and a few sedans with scattergun blasts of mud across the undercarriages parked along the road. In the east two farm hands were rolling out spools of barbed wire at the direction of one of the deputies. They flung steel posts from the four-wheeler as they moved, and it was apparent they were building a barricade between us and that place beyond. Amaya and I stood apart from the others at first and I felt her hand move to my waist. Her fingers fit in at the belt loops her closeness comforted me. The father was a man I knew and whom I thought was decent. He stood out ahead of everyone else and was crouched near the ground. After a while he dug his hands under the grass into the netting of roots to find the clumped loess beneath. He brought it up and examined it before letting it sift away between his fingers. Trying to excavate some kind of reasoning for what had befallen his boy, I figured. A woman was smoking beside us but no one really spoke. Finally someone came up from the road and passed back a bottle of rye whisky. It made its way around and I took my share before giving it to Amaya. She swallowed a bit and I could smell the sweetness of it on her mouth. A stray heeler circled noiselessly. Its canine slouch looking like a patch of dirty snow in the late-summer grass. One of the men gave a low whistle to bid it return. The sound of it ended up seeming dramatic and loud.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Back at the road we waited to offer our condolences to the father but I grew uneasy with what to say and ended up leading Amaya back to my truck. She sat there in the middle of the bench seat and I saw that she was crying quietly. I kissed her hand and told her to wait and went up the road and spoke with Burgess and Stokes who were unloading another spool of wire from the farm truck. They had seen the place already and told me it had spat and stung of lava and smoke. Other men had come to climb the hills to the north the night before, but Stokes said the sheriff turned them away. Not that it had stopped many of them. There at the edge it had been like the earth had parted to reveal itself, and at first it had been strangely alluring, but then it reminded the men of what hell must look like. Burgess spat to the ground with his boot and said that that now he wished he had not seen it at all.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>At the bridge where Crooked Creek bent and then widened I brought the truck to a stop beneath a windbreak of cottonwood. I wanted to tell Amaya about how I had wanted to move on past the father and up over the berm to see that place. The very thought of this made me feel ashamed however and I remained quiet as she leaned against me. Outside I pushed the strands of barbed wire apart so she could slip through first and we both walked through the morning glory and into the pasture. Up the flank of the long hill we could finally see the bulk of smoke flattened out over the valley. In the fading light the smoky underbelly lay bruised with color as what unseen below seethed.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the ninth summer of the conflict, I was hired as a translator for a foreign officer. My wife was furious. For days, she refused to speak to me other than mumbling <em>That man is the devil</em> even though she’d never met him. I walked behind her as she mumbled. I reminded her our lives were rubble, and in spite of her warnings, I took the job.</p>
<p>I talked my younger brother into a job as our driver. His wife was no happier, but they had a baby on the way. I was relieved to see my brother occupied in legitimate work.</p>
<p>As it turned out, the foreign officer rarely spoke. The skin of his face was constantly peeling. In the open jeep I watched it flutter like torn parchment over his reddened skin. I suggested we stop for water. “No. Keep moving.” He said this to me. I relayed this to my brother. My brother, clearly exhausted and parched, said something back that I didn’t dare translate. The officer didn’t ask.</p>
<p>The foreign officer has a scar like a crescent slicing the back of his skull, as if someone at some time wanted to peer inside. The officer has a metal plate beneath his scalp. Sometimes, the metal gleams through his skin.</p>
<p>On a stretch of dusty road, after turns that took us nowhere, we stopped to ask directions from a shepherd. My brother claimed to know him which surprised me. He got out and walked through the goats and sheep. They talked for a long time. The animals milled about alongside the road, making their animal noises. From the back of the jeep, I watched the officer’s profile. He stared, unblinking through his sunglasses. “What are they saying?” “Nothing.” “They can’t be saying nothing.” I listened more closely. “He’s asking after the man’s father.” “They’re talking too long. Tell him get back in the jeep.” I yelled at my brother to hurry up. My brother told me to fuck off. He and the shepherd kept talking. Now and then they both looked over at the officer. The shepherd turned and pointed in one direction, then another. He leaned in to whisper. They embraced, and my brother palmed him money that the shepherd slipped into a pocket before walking back into the field, followed by the animals. Where my brother got the money, I had no idea. When he finally got back in the jeep, he had no time to open his mouth before the officer fired and blew open his skull. The officer pushed him out onto the dirt. He lay twitching; blood pooled around his head. I screamed and tried climbing out the back seat when the officer moved behind the wheel, put the jeep into gear, and drove us off.</p>
<p>*<br />
Later that day, I became the driver. When we arrived at the next village, it was quiet. The officer doesn’t like this kind of quiet. In front of a butcher shop little boys were squatting, shooting marbles in the dust. The officer told me to stop. I got out and went around to greet the boys. There were five of them, and a scrawny dog with three legs. The dog sniffed at my trousers. There was blood on them. The officer stood up in the jeep and looked down at us. From his attaché he removed a paper sack. He plunged his meaty hand inside and out came a wad of colorful wrapped candies. He held the sweaty fist of candy over the boys, waiting to drop it into their hands. The boys didn’t move. The tallest boy glared at me. I looked away. Eventually, the officer dropped the candy back into the sack. The sack rattled. He turned it upside down and shook it. Colorful candies rained down onto the dust. The dog hobbled over to inspect them. “Ask them where their fathers are.” I felt sick. A patch of skin on his left cheek flaked off in the hot wind. He opened his mouth to repeat the command but I’d already turned to the children and translated. The smallest boy replied before the tallest, the one who hated me, could clamp his hand over the little one’s mouth. “Well?” the officer asked. I looked at the boys, clutching onto each other. I looked at the pale animal carcasses hung up in the shop window. “Away,” I said. “Gone to look for work in the north.” The officer scrutinized me. I looked again at the boys. I wondered if the fathers were watching from their hiding places. I wondered if they were armed.</p>
<p>The officer stepped down from the jeep. His hand gripped the neck of the boy who’d spoken up; the others scattered. He put his pistol to the child’s temple.</p>
<p>The child shook. “Be calm…” I begged him.</p>
<p>“What did you say?”</p>
<p>“I’m telling him to be still!” I was shaking like the child.</p>
<p>“Why doesn’t his father come out? Ask him.”</p>
<p>When finally I could speak, I warned the child not to repeat what he’d said. I enunciated as if it were a question. I advised him to lie. I made promises I couldn’t keep.</p>
<p>The child’s eyes were enormous. A damp spot spread over the front of his shorts; urine trickled down his leg into his sandal.</p>
<p>The mother arrived, shouting, unafraid of the gun. The officer pushed the boy down into the candies.</p>
<p>“The men in this village are pussies. Tell her that.”</p>
<p>The woman resembled my sister. She looked at me. Hard. She gathered up the child and before she left, she made a gesture I understood as the transmission of a curse.</p>
<p>I climbed back into the jeep, still shaking. I drove the foreign officer away. That night the village was obliterated by bombs dropped from the foreign officer’s planes. And me, I survive. I’m a channel between two worlds. I spend my hours driving from village to village, searching for the enemy who looks exactly like me.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>            </span>I’m eating rice krispies when my mother asks me whether I’d like to go to church camp. She pours corn flakes for my little sister and douses them with milk.<span>  </span>It’s March and snow is piled on the window sill.<span>  </span>Frost has tooled lace on the glass.<span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>“When?” I ask.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>“Next summer.” </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>Next summer seems like an eternity away.<span>  </span>First comes Easter, then my birthday in May, then summer.<span>  </span>My brother is swinging his legs under the table.<span>  </span>He kicks me accidentally and I kick him back.<span>  </span>So he kicks me on purpose and I kick him back hard. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>“Kids from lots of different churches will be there.<span>  </span>It lasts for a week.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span><span>  </span>My brother pokes me on the shoulder and I punch him on the arm.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>“Stop it, you two,” Mother orders.<span>  </span>Then she pulls out a chair and sits down with her bowl of Wheaties.<span>  </span>“Why don’t you think about it for a while,” she suggests shrewdly.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>I had never been separated from my parents over night.<span>  </span>But c</span>hurch camp offered the fabulous and real possibility of life without my brother and sister and without my parents.<span>   </span>No one would force me to pick the peas, or eat my slimy kohlrabi, or dry the ugly dishes, or go to bed while it was still light.<span>  </span>Six whole days of freedom stretched before me like a veritable midway of circus rides.<span>  </span>I could swim whenever I wanted, including after lunch.<span>  </span>My reading reveries wouldn’t be interrupted by my mother telling me to go outside and get fresh air.<span>  </span>I could get by eating nothing but cookies, and stay up all night.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>  </span><span>          </span>The Monday I set out for camp, my mother had to leave for work at seven.<span>   </span>I was already up and dressed.<span>  </span>I sat on my parents’ bed watching her pull on her white nylons and adjust the seams.<span>  </span>She powdered her chest above her bra and stepped into her nurse’s uniform. My father handed her the lunch he had packed for her and then we walked behind her to the car.<span>  </span>Her nylons made a reassuring whishing sound as she walked, but when she turned around to say goodbye, her face registered inclement weather.<span>  </span>She hugged me for several seconds longer than normal, then got into the car and twisted the key in the ignition.<span>  </span>The starter motor turned over, but she idled in the driveway, rolled down the window, stuck her head out, and said, <em>Don’t forget your sweater</em>.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">She backed the car a few feet, then stopped.<span>  </span><em>Give her a little money</em>, she said to my father.<span>  </span>He pulled out his wallet and handed me two dollars.<span>   </span><em>You’ll be okay, </em>she told me, flicking her head quickly.<span>  </span>Then she hastily backed out.<span>  </span>I felt delighted that she was going to miss me.<span>  </span>It gave me a sense of power.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">My father helped me fold and pack my Sunday dresses in our tan suitcase because I wanted to look cool at camp.<span>  </span>He had a heart condition, as my parents called it, which is why he’d sold his general store in Parkers Prairie, Minnesota and moved us to Lincoln, Nebraska, where my mother could get work.<span>  </span>In our new city he cheerfully scouted stores and vegetable markets for the family groceries, tended us kids, and sewed small cheesecloth bags of herbs for his savory vegetable soup.<span>  </span>That fall he had poured his energy into helping to establish The Lincoln Christian School in a church basement.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As I watched my princely sandy-haired father latch the suitcase with his freckled hands and buckle a belt around it, I began to feel slightly queasy.<span>  </span>I walked downstairs, carefully gripping the hand rail.<span>  </span>I stood beside my favorite spot in our back yard by the tiger lilies.<span>  </span>Closing my eyes, I tried to recover the reckless pleasure of being without any parents for a week, but I felt seasick, as if I were standing in a violently rocking rowboat.<span>  </span>The waves, pulling me farther from the shore, were not about to stop.<span>  </span>I was going to camp.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">A tenuous bunch of authorities ruled over us campers.<span>  </span>There was a director named Pastor Ray, who looked slightly goofy in his tight rayon shirt and brown pants.<span>  </span>A few parental volunteers stood around Pastor Ray, and a squadron of gangly kids worked behind folding tables.<span>  </span>They looked about the age of the high-schoolers I knew from church.<span>  </span>We were standing around a clearing in the woods.<span>   </span>Cabins were scattered around the edge, in the trees.<span>  </span>Above their doors, on posters, fat, cloud-shaped magic marker letters spelled out:<span>  </span><em>The Purple Dragons, The Holy Ghosts,</em> and <em>Nancy’s Storm Troopers.</em><span>  </span>One was called <em>Cabin Six.</em><span>  </span>I didn’t want to be assigned to Cabin Six, which I believed must have something wrong with it.<span>    </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Our counselors shoved one another, hooting and laughing as they checked off our names, allotted us sheets and pillows, and handed us our schedules,.<span>  </span>They ebbed and flowed like water, losing track of us briefly, retreating, whispering, buzzing, swarming in a group, then remembering their jobs, returning to their posts.<span>   </span>I didn’t know anyone except Audrey Jones, the friend of our family who had driven me to camp with her daughter, Marilyn.<span>  </span>She was talking with the other parent-volunteers.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Other campers went off with their friends, laughing and gabbing, holding their assignment sheets.<span>    </span>I was on my own, literally struck dumb by the high-jinks of the counselors.<span>  </span>I didn’t know which line to stand in and I was too shy to ask.<span>  </span>Hoping I was right, I added myself to the longest line.<span>  </span>When I got to the front, I faced a tousle-haired high school boy.<span>  </span>“Uh, I’m here for camp,” was my brilliant opening.<span>  </span>My words sounded far away and disconnected from me, like the voice of a ventriloquist.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Accepting the schedule and my cabin assignment and the whole unwieldy welcome packet, I juggled everything with my suitcase to the edge of the clearing where I stopped and put it all down in the brown pine needles.<span>  </span>Then I stooped over and picked up the documents one at a time.<span>  </span>I examined each, looking for some code explaining what I should do next.<span>  </span>Surreptitiously I watched other campers, trying to guess what the other girls were doing.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Many of them were rushing gracefully into one another’s arms, or screaming together with laughter as they crossed the clearing in small gangs.<span>  </span>That day, and truthfully every day after that, I watched with stupefied bewilderment as the other girls performed simple actions such as introducing themselves, or telling jokes, or playing volleyball, or testifying.<span>  </span>Many of them did these things with such elegance that I believed I had stumbled into a camp where everyone except me was destined to become Miss America.<span>     </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The camp schedule started with reveille, ran through breakfast, hymn sing, Bible study, lunch, quiet time, sports, crafts, free time, dinner, revival meeting, and campfire.<span>   </span>It ended with taps.<span>  </span>I didn’t know what any of these things were.<span>  </span>I discovered the next day.<span>   </span>Later I realized the schedule was something Pastor Ray could show our parents if they had any questions.<span>  </span>In practice, the drumbeat of the schedule turned out to be more irregular than it appeared on paper.<span>  </span>Above it I could always hear the soaring descant, the melody, the troubled, throbbing, torrid libretto of our counselors’ personal lives.<span><span> </span><span>  </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>I spotted the necklace on Monday afternoon, after unpacking my suitcase in my cabin.<span>   </span>I still remember that moment vividly, in the present tense.<span>   </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>Walking around the tables in the camp canteen, I see a small box holding a greenish plastic cross.<span>  </span></span>It’s about the width of a table knife and the height of a Popsicle stick, and it is affixed to a rawhide string.<span>  </span>I stand at the display table staring at it, keeping myself very still.<span>  </span>I can feel my heart beat in my wrists, which dangle at my sides.<span>  </span>In the stifling Nebraska summer afternoon, a trickle of sweat runs down my stomach.<span>  </span>I cannot believe how beautiful the cross is.<span>  </span>A little placard explains that it glows in the dark.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Glancing significantly at the grownup tending the cash register, so he understands that I am not stealing, I remove the cross from its box.<span>  </span>I stoop and thrust it into the shadows under the table.<span>  </span>It emits a minty light, which is entirely inexplicable, since the necklace doesn’t contain any light bulb or battery.<span>  </span>Shining beneath the table, it appears to be cutting into the darkness with its clear edges.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Mist clouds my eyes.<span>  </span>I want this cross the way a person wants health.<span>  </span>At Temple Baptist Church, where my family belongs, we believe it’s wrong to keep images.<span>  </span>Our sanctuary contains pews, facing a plain oak communion table and a podium.<span>  </span>We don’t keep religious symbols in our houses, either.<span>  </span>So I have never held a crucifix or looked at one carefully.<span>   </span>My aching love for this simple fluorescent cross in the palm of my hand is as astonishing as it is powerful and I haven’t the faintest idea at the time that my attraction to it is the first step of a journey that will lead me to a radical separation from my mother.<span>  </span>My problem at the moment is that the cross costs two dollars, and two dollars is the entire amount wadded up in the small red plastic coin purse back in my cabin, the amount my father handed me just before I got into Audrey Jones’ car yesterday and drove away from him.<span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">During weeks of dreaming about being at camp, I imagined buying soft drinks and cookies during breaks, wandering nonchalantly through the canteen with my hands in my pockets perusing the items carefully, weighing alternatives.<span>  </span>It feels lovely now, the possibility of putting my hand out to touch something, knowing that I could either choose that or move on to something else, knowing that I can touch something entirely different tomorrow and it will be mine too.<span>   </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I planned not to spend any of the two dollars on the first day.<span>  </span>I just looked.<span>  </span>What I had left was enough to buy something in the morning and in the afternoon every day for the rest of the week.<span>  </span>If I gave the man at the cash register my whole two dollars I would have to stop coming to the canteen, because I couldn’t bear seeing the crafts and candy and soda pop and books and book marks and plaques without being able to buy something.<span>      </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">So I made my feet walk out of the canteen past the cross, into the brilliant sunshine.<span>  </span>My feet felt sweaty in my tennis shoes. They didn’t want to leave.<span>  </span>Lifting them was as hard for me as lifting the heavy flatiron at my grandmother’s house in Pipestone, Minnesota, the one she set on the wood stove so it would heat up and she could press her dresses.<span>    </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>It’s Wednesday, after lunch.<span>  </span>I’ve gotten through two days and we are all hidden away from the consuming heat, resting on our bunks in our cool, dark cabin.<span>   </span>We can hear the sighing of the pines outside and a little breeze blows through the screened windows.<span>  </span>Our counselor, Nancy, checks the door to make sure no one is eavesdropping, then motions us campers to gather on the bunks around hers.<span>  </span>She confides in her hoarse, sensual voice, that the Lord is leading her toward John.<span>  </span>John has big shoulders and a beard.<span>  </span>He buries the camp garbage and builds the bonfires.<span>  </span>Just yesterday I saw John holding hands with Maureen.<span>  </span>I am astonished.<span>   </span>Does Nancy really think that God wants John to break Maureen’s heart?<span>   </span>My parents are intensely loyal to one another and it is just beginning to occur to me that people actually jilt and get jilted.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">As a mosquito buzzes in the humid early afternoon air, we sit, hushed.<span>  </span>I am stunned by the magnitude of Nancy’s confidence in us, waiting for her to unburden herself further. Nancy fishes in her purse and draws out a new lipstick.<span>  </span>She breaks the seal and screws out its tongue.<span>  </span>Then she passes it around, permitting us to test it on one another’s lips.<span>  </span>I am puzzled because I have been taught that wearing makeup leads to false pride.<span>   </span>It seems peculiar to me that a counselor at Bible Camp is pushing lipstick, but I’ve never held a tube of lipstick, and when I get my hands on it I feel a joyful flutter in my stomach.<span>   </span>I pass it to the girl on my left.<span>  </span>Before we resume Quiet Time, Nancy makes us hold up both hands, palms out, and swear to secrecy.<span>  </span>She plans to put a frog in John’s bed tonight.<span>   </span>As an afterthought she makes us swear that we will not get into mischief while she is busy with the frog.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>            </span>The amount of time our camp counselors spent climbing around in the Alps of teenage love damaged their judgment.<span>  </span>Maureen soon realized that Nancy’s objective was to gain the attention of Maureen’s boyfriend.<span>  </span>Under Maureen’s direction, her girls bolted our cabin door from the outside.<span>  </span>When a brown haired girl named Lavinia, who was the only camper quieter than I was, got up in the night to go to the bathroom, she couldn’t open the door.<span>  </span>I awoke to bumping and whispers.<span>  </span>Lavinia was wiping the floor with her pajama top.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">In our morning Bible study the counselors took turns giving testimonies about the Beatitudes, blessed are the meek, blessed are the poor in spirit, but cabin loyalty led to a system of tribal vengeance.<span>  </span>Nancy organized us.<span>  </span>During the revival service one evening, we propped a plastic pitcher filled with pancake syrup on Maureen’s cabin door so it would fall on whoever opened it first.<span>  </span>We threw sheets over our heads at midnight and waited for Maureen’s girls.<span>  </span>We hovered in silence among the ghostly trees by the dark, spooky path to the bathroom, not far from a massive stone we believed marked a grave.<span>  </span>One of the girls whispered to me that it denoted the place a former camper was buried, a camper, I thought, who might have been caught in the gears of heartbreak and revenge.<span>  </span>Trotting down the path to the bathroom, passing that stone, I could feel terror welling in my chest like a sparkly fountain, creating a romantic thrill that I now realize I must have nurtured, sometimes taking that path just so I could feel it again.<span>    </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Other pranks shocked me because they hovered outside the world I understood as civilized, which at that time meant the world of my family and our school.<span>  </span>One afternoon a counselor named Nate swam underwater, seizing and biting the leg of one of the fat, unpopular boys.<span>  </span>The boy, who thought he had been attacked by a shark, shrieked, and bounded out of the water.<span>  </span>He balled up his fists and screamed for a long time.<span>  </span>Everyone laughed.<span>  </span>It was supposed to be funny, so I laughed, but he never went swimming again.<span>  </span>Watching him sweat on the shore as we swam one day, I felt so sad for him that I didn’t get into the water myself.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Then some kids ran one camper’s pajamas up the flagpole so he had to sleep naked.<span>  </span>They stole and hid the silverware from the dining hall.<span>   </span>In our cabin, Nancy paged through <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Seventeen</span> magazine while we raced around and threw Rice Krispies at one another.<span>  </span>She painted our toenails the red of brake-lights.<span>  </span>She advised us about which boys she thought were cute and hinted at the sultry mysteries of sex.<span>  </span>I was so inexperienced that much of the time I was reduced to the status of a silent observer who was learning the jokes and gambits of an alien tribe. Meanwhile, the camp director sat in his shirtsleeves in the office, fanning himself and talking on the black telephone.<span>       </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>I was probably the smallest child at camp, and I had no inkling of the awakening that would befall me in a year or two.<span>  </span>For me the curtain hadn’t opened on the opera of adolescence.<span>  </span>I didn’t even know there <em>was</em> an opera.<span>  </span>Not that I wasn’t passionate.<span>  </span>That summer I lustily sang four part harmony:<span>  </span><em><span> </span>I’ve got a home in glory land that outshines the sun.<span>  </span>I’ve got a home in glory land that outshines the sun.<span>  </span>Do Lord, oh do Lord, oh do remember me, way beyond the blue.</em><span>  </span>They were the songs of my mother’s fundamentalist people, earthy and rowdy and I loved them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Then there were the lyrics that actually were love songs, though I didn’t yet comprehend that.<span>  </span><em>I come to the garden alone, when the dew is still on the roses and the voice I hear singing in my ear no other sound discloses.<span>  </span>And I walk with him and I talk with him and I tell him I am his own.<span>  </span>And the joy we share as we linger there, none other has ever known.<span>  </span></em><span> </span>I warbled the words with a reverent urgency that I didn’t comprehend as sexuality.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">And chow.<span>  </span>I adored chow:<span>  </span>fried chicken and mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, tapioca pudding, creamed cauliflower, all of it overcooked.<span>  </span>And cookies galore.<span>  </span>No one was making me eat carrots or liver.<span>  </span>We campers stood on the grass in a snaky line, breathing in the earthy aroma of baking bread, singing <em>Here we sit like birds in the wilderness, birds in the wilderness, waiting to be fed,</em> until the cooks opened the wide doors and we could heap our plates with white, starchy, abundant food unlike what my mother made at home.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">At night we huddled in a circle, mesmerized as the bonfire licked the sky with its yellow and red tongues.<span>  </span>I felt like a Neanderthal child:<span>   </span>close, folded into her tribe, safe against the enormous, feeling dark.<span>  </span>But during the day I walked around camp on the edge of tears, overwhelmed by the terrible facts I was discovering about the world.<span>  </span>Naïve as I was, I could feel the undercurrent of pulsing adolescent sexuality.<span>  </span>What did it mean?<span>  </span>I knew enough to be aware I was missing something, but what?<span>   </span>And then there was the fierce competition between cabins.<span>  </span>I began to wonder whether everything my mother had taught us at home as normal human behavior was actually deviant.<span>          </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">What brought on full blown homesickness in me was a tactless remark from some older girl, a sarcasm, some condescension that made me suddenly aware of how young I was, how terribly out of place.<span>  </span>The girl might have been Maureen, who by then had surrendered John to our counselor, Nancy.<span>  </span>I don’t remember.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">It’s mid-week and I am brushing my teeth in the rough-timbered, stinky bathroom.<span>  </span>The windows have been propped open and sparky bright morning air flows above the row of sinks.<span>  </span>Someone—say it’s Maureen&#8211;is standing beside me at the next sink.<span>  </span>She is a willowy high school girl with some power to say what happens at camp.<span>  </span>Her long, brown hair curls tastefully on her shoulders.<span>  </span>I feel a presence, and I look up at her, seeing that she is watching me, appraising me.<span>  </span>The glistening, hard black of her pupils in the middle of her blue eyes makes my heart hammer in my chest.<span>  </span>I work to breathe.<span>  </span>I feel like a flailing fish in a boat.<span>  </span>I try not to betray my alarm.<span>     </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>“Hi,” </span>I say through a mouthful of Colgate.<span>  </span>I have learned that much.<span>  </span>You have to greet people in the morning, even if you don’t feel like it.<span>  </span>Even if you never greet members of your own family at home.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">She tosses her hair back.<span>  </span>“Are you old enough for this camp?” she asks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I bet you’re not eleven!”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I’m ten.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>“Honey, Jesus wants you for a sunbeam</span>.”<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I’m not sure what she means by this, so I am unable to contribute a reply to the conversation she has honored me by starting.<span>  </span>In our church they sing <em>Jesus Wants You For A Sunbeam</em> at the children’s service.<span>  </span>The last time I sang it, I was about six.<span>   </span>It slowly dawns on me that Maureen must be telling me I am too young to be here.<span>  </span>I realize that she’s probably been watching me observe and then follow what the older kids do.<span>  </span>I wonder whether I appear even more bizarre than I feel.<span>  </span>I hear the water gushing from the faucet.<span>  </span>Outside there is the sound of tremendous flapping, as if wet sheets are blowing in a gale.<span>  </span>I see through the window a mob of startled crows taking to sky.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Maureen is standing with her orange toothbrush in her mouth, staring at me, waiting for me to reply.<span>  </span>I try to think of something, but my mind is blank and smooth as a bald gray highway going nowhere. I’m breathing fast.<span>  </span>I turn and begin brushing my teeth again.<span>  </span>She shuts the water off with a flourish and walks out.<span>  </span>That seems to put a period at the end of the long sentence of my weeklong childish incompetence.<span>  </span>Suddenly, after my conversation with Maureen, I long to go home.<span>  </span>I begin feeling what I later learn the word for.<span>  </span>I feel homesick.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">When I am done brushing my teeth, I walk to the canteen.<span>  </span>I saunter around the tables, pretending to be interested in the pastel candy with Bible verses printed on it or the fluorescent bumper stickers announcing that GOD IS LOVE.<span>  </span>But the cross reels me in a slow circle around it.<span>  </span>Finally I reach the table and pick it up.<span>  </span>I feel calmer.<span>  </span>I hold it in a shadow and it gives off lovely greening light.<span>         </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Homesickness is a disease that rivets its victim’s imagination on home so powerfully that nothing else seems real.<span>   </span>I, who had read <em>The Boxcar Children</em> and dreamed the pleasures of being an orphan, began suffering from an imagination entirely filled up with my mother.<span>  </span>I pictured her stepping into her car the Monday I left for camp.<span>  </span>I heard her voice calling my name over and over.<span>  </span>I smelled her Tweed perfume and felt her hand lightly on the back of my neck.<span>  </span>The very woodsy air I breathed stifled me.<span>  </span>I couldn’t eat.<span>  </span>I cried.<span>  </span>I vomited.<span>  </span>My head pulsated.<span>  </span>I feared talking to anyone, in case I might dissolve in tears.<span>  </span>I was infected with self-consciousness.<span>  </span>I watched myself like a homesick child in a movie who loses weight, dwindles, and slowly dissolves into the landscape.<span>  </span>The next day, I stayed in my cabin during Hymn Sing and Bible Study.<span>  </span>Pastor Ray didn’t notice.<span>  </span>Even Nancy didn’t notice.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Dutifully I went to craft time, where I lolled in front of bins of Popsicle sticks and clay and yarn strips and paper and sequins and glue and paints.<span>  </span>I could not think of a single reason to pick up any of it.<span>  </span>I needed to lie down.<span>  </span>I wanted to sleep.<span>  </span>The counselor in charge cheerfully tried to convince me to braid a lanyard, which he said I could use as a key chain.<span>  </span>He suggested different colors, the bright gold, the royal blue, the forest green.<span>  </span>The thing is, I didn’t own any keys.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Then give it to your mother,” he suggested.<span>   </span>I wanted to see my mother so desperately that the very word <em>mother </em>made me bolt from the tent.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">My mother’s friend, Audrey Jones, who had brought me to camp, drove up on Friday to volunteer.<span>  </span>She must have noticed that something was wrong with me.<span>  </span>She lured me out of my cabin by inviting me to the canteen.<span>  </span>She bought me a coke, and asked me whether I was all right.<span>  </span>She meant well.<span>  </span>But all I could see was how different she was from my cozy, black-haired mother.<span>  </span>She was athletic and plain-spoken, with a square jaw.<span>  </span>She had a habit of wearing anklets with heels.<span>  </span>As I sat at the table across from her, I couldn’t talk, I was so homesick.<span>  </span>I knew I was being monstrously ungrateful.<span>  </span>Her only crime was not being my mother.<span>  </span>But I was unable to stop the mawkish longing that this woman could not satisfy.<span>   </span>We listened to the rain beating on the canteen’s metal siding.<span>   </span>We sat together in awkward silence, a generous, concerned adult and the broken child she was trying to help.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The week at camp turned so ghastly partly because there wasn’t much adult supervision and our counselors were unprepared to manage a bunch of children.<span>  </span>And maybe my mother should have foreseen that.<span>  </span>But I need to explain.<span>  </span>She coyly lured me into signing up for this camp because I’d spent the previous August roving our neighborhood with a juvenile delinquent named Junior.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I took Junior with me one afternoon when my mother sent me to the supermarket down the block from our house to buy a bottle of catsup.<span>  </span>I had only been in the store a couple of times and as we strolled through the aisles I beheld a fantasy world I could barely believe.<span>  </span>We had just moved to Lincoln from Parkers Prairie, where my father’s General Store with its 8 aisles was the whole world of commerce.<span>  </span>But in this bright daydream of a supermarket I gazed at cartons of chocolate and pistachio and strawberry ice cream.<span>  </span>There were a dozen different kinds and colors of pasta.<span>  </span>There were cheeses of all shapes and colors and sizes.<span>  </span>I beheld Hershey bars and Mars bars and Heath bars and pink bubble gum with funnies and strings of licorice and chocolate frosting mix that our family could never hope to buy.<span>  </span>Pushing a cart, Junior and I started out with good intentions, but soon we were merely pretending to shop, stuffing licorice and Mary Janes and Hershey bars into our pockets.<span>  </span>Along the way, we dropped a bottle of catsup into the cart and stood in the check-out line and paid for it so we would appear legitimate and no one would suspect us.<span>  </span>We brought the catsup home to my mother and then made for our hide-out in Junior’s garage where we knocked back candy until my mother called me for dinner.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Some afternoons Junior and I lurked around houses in the neighborhood, sneaking onto porches and snitching whatever we fancied.<span>  </span>We invoked the “finders keepers” rule.<span>  </span>We figured that if people left toys and sprinklers out, our minor thievery might keep them from falling prey to even greater thievery. <span> </span>One afternoon we pillaged cookie samples from the garage of a Keebler salesman and ate them till we lay like fat ticks on his front lawn.<span>  </span>Afterwards, I felt vaguely guilty.<span>  </span>That evening when I saw a man heading for our front porch, I felt alarm.<span>  </span>His lunging walk and balled-up fists tipped me off.<span>  </span>I shouldn’t have taken the cookies.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">He rang our doorbell.<span>  </span>My mother answered the door.<span>  </span>He told her that her daughter had stolen and eaten the samples he needed to make a living.<span>   </span>He shouted loudly enough to attract attention from our neighbor, who stopped coiling his garden hose and watched.<span>  </span>The cookie salesman cursed and stomped his foot.<span>      </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">My mother slipped into her self-assured nurse persona.<span>  </span>“Oh, no, I don’t think my daughter would do that,” she informed him.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span> </span>He raised his voice.<span>  </span>He used words that were forbidden in our family.<span>  </span>My mother flipped the screen door lock to keep him outside and summoned me.<span>  </span>“This man says you went into his garage and took his cookies.”<span>  </span>I could feel her eyes evaluating me.<span>  </span>“You wouldn’t do that, would you?”<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span> </span>I swallowed back terror.<span>  </span>“No,” I told her.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">No.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">But my mother was not a fool.<span>  </span>Bible camp was her way of separating me from Junior.<span>  </span>Maybe she thought at Bible camp I’d experience a programmatic change of heart.<span>  </span>As it turns out, that week did set me on different path, but not one she would have chosen; she was a committed Baptist and religious images gave her the heebie jeebies.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">On Friday afternoon, I made a final journey to the canteen to look at the cross.<span>  </span>I’d taken that walk many times, even though I had decided early in the week that I couldn’t afford it.<span>  </span>Walking into the canteen tent, I saw they were having a sale.<span>  </span>The price of the cross had been slashed to a dollar thirty.<span>  </span>Noticing that I was eying it again, the man at the counter asked me how much money I had.<span>  </span>I showed him my dollar ten.<span>  </span>He took my money, slipped the cross in a bag, and handed it to me.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">For the first time during the entire week, I felt joy.<span>  </span>I crawled under the display table, where the cross illuminated the dark.<span>  </span>By its light I could see under the covers of my bunk.<span>  </span>And that night it lit up the path when I traveled alone to the bathroom.<span>  </span>Its Halloweeny radiance appeared transcendent to me, as it apparently did not to other campers.<span>  </span>There were almost as many necklaces remaining on the commissary table at the end of camp as there had been at the beginning.<span>   </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I don’t remember what happened to that cross.<span>  </span>During one of my many moves I must have given it away, probably because it bespoke a childhood I wanted to shed.<span>  </span>But it signaled a beginning, too, the first time I’d felt drawn to an image.<span>  </span>It was finally images and metaphors with their multivalent power that I followed out of my mother’s fundamentalism.<span>  </span>Now, as I sit here writing, I wish I could take the cross out again and look at it.<span>  </span>It was kitschy, I admit.<span>  </span>But I would make it stand for something, maybe for the fact that our most crucial decisions are small ones that start as secrets inside us and find their way out.<span>   </span>I’d let it stand for that mystery at the center of each of us and for the unpredictable, funny grace that can befall us&#8211;because it was grace, surely, that made me see the beauty of that cross.<span>  </span>I’d let the cross mark the first time I remember feeling the bitter-sweet longing we call homesickness and the first time I aligned myself against my mother’s literal way of seeing the world.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">On the bumpy ride back home with Audrey Jones, I looked forward to seeing my mother the way I looked forward to Christmas.<span>  </span>I wore the cross, holding it steady in a chute of sunlight that streamed into the car window.<span>  </span>I could almost hear the thing gathering whatever light it could into itself.<span>  </span>I wanted to show Mother how much light it gave off.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">When I got home, I did, I showed her.<span>   </span>“That’s nice,” she said and opened the oven to check whether the squash was done.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">She had not been homesick for me, of course, and she had no way of knowing that I had been homesick for her, because I didn’t know how to tell her.<span>  </span>And how could she know that I had been set on a path to collide with her most deeply felt and believed faith?<span>  </span>I didn’t know it yet myself.<span>  </span>Like much of what’s important, that remained secret.<span>  </span>Mother made a cake and the whole family celebrated my return. <span> </span>But that night, in my own bed, I watched the cross slowly pay out radiance into the darkness.<span>  </span>As the day around it failed and night came, it grew steadily more articulate, its edges sharpening against the dark.<span>  </span>It seemed like a star that had fallen to earth, something a person could navigate by.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"> The clanking of the car’s engine ceases a few miles outside of town and Cliff and I settle into it, the wide quiet. We’re told that here, high up and in fall, aspens turn whole mountains gold.<span>  </span>I twist the knob on the radio, though it’s been broken for years.<span>  </span>We listen, instead, to rubber on asphalt.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">For a while I watch the scrub, scouring the beige sand for coyotes or jackrabbits.<span>  </span>Then, looking down I notice the specks of coffee and dust in the vinyl lining of the emergency brake.<span>  </span>My husband, Cliff, stares at the road, the yellow lines finally disappearing.<span>  </span>He’s from the desert and so he likes this, this alien blue sky, the way the road out in the distance wiggles and turns into a lake.<span>  </span>I’m from the coast.<span>  </span>I miss the trees, the way they hide wires and facades, the way they block up the view.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Because it’s quiet, because we are the only people we know here, Cliff and I argue.<span>  </span>It’s nothing serious.<span>  </span>He leaves his clothes in the washer until they’re dried to the sides and must be peeled away.<span>  </span>If I ask him to take out the trash, he asks me to pick up my clothes. This morning we argued about eggs, whether when you poach one, you put vinegar in the water.<span>  </span>Oh, the quiet—the big brown mesa out our window blowing air and dust and birds, the way it turns us toward each other like opposing magnets.<span>  </span>He’s still sore at me for asking him if he ever poached an egg.<span>  </span>“It’s not what you <em>ask</em>,” he said, leaning forward with his shoulders.<span>  </span>“It’s how you ask it.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Today, we’ll find the aspens.<span>  </span>But, Cliff seems to say with his jaw, with his arms locked in front of him like two table legs, this doesn’t mean he forgives me.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Let’s play a game,” I offer.<span>  </span>Cliff pushes back into his seat, listening. I remove my feet from the glovebox, leaving a dusty grid.<span>  </span>“Tell me a story.<span>  </span>Something I don’t know about you.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">He uses his thumb to flatten the hair above his sideburns.<span>  </span>Last night, during a peaceful interlude, I trimmed them.<span>  </span>Now they look shorn while the top of his hair puffs up, a shiny mushroom.<span>  </span>He’s clearly wrestling with it—whether to succumb to the invitation, filling the car with friendly chatter or refuse, keeping the petulant, if ridiculous, chill.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Cliff watches the road for a while.<span>  </span>He keeps mints in the cup holder and now he reaches for one.<span>  </span>It crunches between his teeth.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">We drive over a dead gopher and Cliff shakes his head slowly.<span>  </span>He’s a failed vegetarian, but the sight of road kill makes him pensive.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“What kind of story?” he asks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“I don’t know.<span>  </span>Something you’ve never told me.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Give me a topic,” he says.<span>  </span>I touch his hand on the steering wheel and briefly, he takes his other hand and puts it on top of mine.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Injuries or scars,” I say, because why not?<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“You already know about my scars,” he says, which is true.<span>  </span>He had a large mole removed from his thigh when he was young and it left a raw pink line which he sometimes claims is a shark bite.<span>  </span>He has a small white storm of marks on his ankle from getting caught in some barbed wire.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“The next time we see a gas station, we have to stop,” he says.<span>  </span>“Did I ever tell you about Shane and the BB gun?” I watch the little black arrow on the gas gauge hover over the white square.<span>  </span>The gas light flicks on.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“No,” I say.<span>  </span>“God, do you remember when everyone had a BB gun?<span>  </span>A kid in my first grade class had a BB embedded in his neck.<span>  </span>You could feel it if you put your fingers on the right place.”<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Cliff glances at the gas light.<span>  </span>He takes another mint.<span>  </span>When he chews, the hollows of his cheeks suck in, making deep caverns.<span>  </span>He hasn’t shaved.<span>  </span>Little flecks of copper and gold wink from the indentations.<span>  </span>“It was that kid, Todd, the one I told you about, the one whose mother brought in super-eight footage of his birth,” I say.<span>  </span>I’m thirty-four and still, whenever someone tells me they’re pregnant, I conjure Todd’s mom hanging from stirrups, screaming like her skin was on fire.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Cliff and I talk about having children—two maybe, even three, but we’ve never actually tried.<span>  </span>Sometimes at night, I pat at the space between us and say, here she is, our Josephina, our Noah, our little progeny.<span>  </span>For a few years, Cliff played along, contributing geographical baby names: Topanga, Tonopah, Sierra.<span>  </span>But now it’s become routine, an airy joke.<span>  </span>Often, he just ignores me.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>He sees a sign and circles back to the last Allsup’s before the mountains.<span>  </span>Leaving the nozzle in the car, he walks into the mini-mart.<span>  </span>The passenger seat won’t move back, no matter how much I try to force it, and when I reach under to wiggle the crank, I find an empty wine bottle there, escaped from the recycling.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">My mind flits to a story I heard in school years ago.<span>  </span>Apollo, god of light and music, is struck by the beauty of a sibyl. What will she trade him for one night in bed?<span>  </span>She considers it.<span>  </span>This is a sharp sibyl and she sees her chance.<span>  </span>He’s a god.<span>  </span>What else to wish for but eternal life?<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Time passes, though, and the sibyl has a change of heart.<span>  </span>She doesn’t want to sleep with him, doesn’t want to hold up her end of the bargain.<span>  </span>It doesn’t take Apollo long to tilt the scales back in his favor.<span>  </span>He’s given her eternal life, but not yet eternal youth.<span>  </span>So, the sibyl ages—and ages forever—growing smaller and smaller as she does.<span>  </span>When she’s finally as small as a grain of sand, she’s swept into a bottle at the ocean’s edge, trapped in a prison of glass.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>It’s moments like these, with a story in my head, that the absence of little Josephina is most pronounced.<span>  </span>She appears, but in ghost form.<span>  </span>I can almost feel her.<span>  </span>Her fine hair is a version of my own, coppery with a corkscrew curl.<span>  </span>She listens to the myth or the song on the radio and I feel a sweep of understanding.<span>  </span>I will leave the world someday, but she will carry our history in these details.<span>  </span>The time I told her the myth while waiting for Cliff to fill the tank.<span>  </span>The way the sun warmed the plastic dash, the fungusy smell of the car.<span>  </span>These things will crawl inside of her like seeds, becoming both important and frivolous, the way history does.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>I would tell Josephina that a sibyl knows everything.<span>  </span>She can see war coming to her country, she can see her friends in peril.<span>   </span>If she were free, she’d have the power to change this, but she’s not free.<span>  </span>She’ll see her predictions come true through the fog of sea-salted glass, growing even tinier, even more insignificant.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><em>I want to die!</em> she’ll cry in her tiny voice.<span>  </span><em>I want to die!</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Cliff tosses a bag of chips at me.<span>   </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“They only had that kind,” he says.<span>  </span>“Super Nacho Cheese with Jalapeño.”<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">A cartoon animal on the front of the package looks like he’d like to lunge at my throat.<span>  </span>I stick the chips by my feet.<span>  </span>Cliff finishes up the gas.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I pick the bottle up and check it for sibyls.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“That’s my emergency plan,” he says, climbing back in.<span>  </span>“Since I refuse to get a cell phone.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">It takes me a minute to understand.<span>  </span>“And float it in what ocean?” I ask.<span>  </span>He shrugs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“God will provide,” he says.<span>  </span>“Open the chips.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The bag’s swollen from the elevation and makes a whooshing sound when I tug.<span>   </span>The quiet happens again.<span>  </span>Two cars pass, making wind.<span>  </span>A large black bird hangs in the sky.<span>  </span>We’re headed up now, then down into a small canyon where some adobes are sprinkled at random, then up again, climbing the side of a mountain.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“It was in Reno,” Cliff says.<span>  </span>“When we lived in Reno, me, my mom, and that guy Ray.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I’ve heard about Ray.<span>  </span>I imagine he was wound too tight, his jaw just skin over a series of pulleys and wires.<span>  </span>Oiled black hair and an oiled black jacket and oiled black shoes.<span>  </span>A belt buckle that sagged toward the floor.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Well, Ray was married when he was seeing my mom.<span>  </span>I told you that, right?<span>  </span>He had this wife.<span>  </span>I can’t remember her name—Pricilla, Prissy—she came around every once in a while.”<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>I put a woman with oily Ray.<span>  </span>One of those women who lack moisture, whose face stretches taught against bone.<span>  </span>She wears a dress—no a waitress uniform.<span>  </span>Light blue with an apron.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Cliff reaches for more chips.<span>  </span>One has fallen onto his tee shirt, defying gravity.<span>  </span>It sits there, cockeyed, at an improbable angle, like a small invisible hand props it up.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“She got a boob job.<span>  </span>That I remember.”<span>  </span>He shakes his head.<span>  </span>“Is that even possible?<span>  </span>Were people getting boob jobs in the late seventies?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“I’d guess yes.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Well, one day she came to the house to pick up her son, Shane.<span>  </span>I guess Ray had joint custody or something.<span>  </span>Shane stashed all these low-budget porno magazines in our shed, so we used to go out there.”<span>  </span>Cliff widens his eyes and makes a smooth, angel face. “Of course, I never looked at the magazines,” he says.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Right.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Prissy was just some older lady, but that day she arrived with a rack like you’ve never seen.<span>  </span>Made a big impression on me.<span>  </span>I was ten.”<span>  </span>He takes another handful of chips.<span>   </span>The rack doesn’t fit with my light blue uniform.<span>  </span>I try to reinvent her—polyester tee shirts?<span>  </span>Low cut blouses?<span>  </span>But now my images are muddled.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Shane had this BB gun.<span>  </span>These chips are gross.<span>  </span>The jalapeño tastes like motor oil.”<span>   </span>Cliff tosses his handful back in the bag, then wipes his hand on his shorts, leaving a small orange dusting.<span>  </span>“I have no idea if Ray got it for him, or if he borrowed it, or if it was from one of his mother’s boyfriends.<span>  </span>Because I remember a lot of boyfriends involved in this Ray thing.<span>  </span>There was Ray, my mom’s boyfriend, but then there were these huge guys with wolves for pets that tagged along with Shane’s mother.<span>  </span>And Ray would get really drunk and cry on the back porch and sometimes my mom would kick him out.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Cliff’s hands clench and unclench around the wheel, his mind skimming over its own history.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Shane had the gun,” he says again.<span>  </span>“And so, obviously, we had to go shoot some stuff.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Obviously.”<span>  </span>I pick the chip off Cliff’s shirt.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Neither of us could drive yet.<span>  </span>Shane put the BB gun in a duffle bag and we got on a bus out of town, this bus that went to the edge of a housing development.<span>  </span>You could walk straight into nowhere after the last house ended.” <span>          </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“You were ten?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“I know.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>For a woman who soothed dying people for a living, who saw that life was temporary, Cliff’s mother, Connie, was surprisingly oblivious to danger.<span>  </span>She dated men with gun racks, knife collections and special radios.<span>  </span>Once, she rode on the back of a motorcycle wearing nothing but a negligee.<span>  </span>I met her two years before she died, after her exotic beauty had given way to a muted and fleshy facade.<span>  </span>She had the coloring of a Christmas dinner—ham and bread pudding, overboiled green beans.<span>  </span>But photos of her young capture sharp shoulders and lithe arms, a butt poured into dark denim.<span>  </span>In a few she winks, as if she knows a secret.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Shane wanted to shoot lizards.<span>  </span>So we did.<span>  </span>We shot maybe six of them.<span>  </span>They were sunning on the rocks and we just picked them off.<span>  </span>I don’t think we missed even one.”<span>  </span>It’s odd he doesn’t cringe, this man who softens over the sight of a gopher smeared like jam over the asphalt.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“And then, the weird part,” Cliff said.<span>  </span>“Shane wanted me to take the gun.<span>  </span>He put it in my hands and he dared me to shoot my own foot.<span>  </span>I said no. He said it would feel good.<span>  </span>I asked him if he’d done it, shot his own foot.<span>  </span>And Shane pulled up his pant leg and showed me a whole mess of scars, a million tiny white bumps and lines.”<span>  </span>He reaches for the chips, but changes his mind.<span>  </span>“Do you have any gum?” he asks.<span>  </span>I don’t.<span>  </span>“Water?” he asks.<span>  </span>I hand him my Nalgene.<span>  </span>He drinks for what seems like a long time.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“And then?” I say.<span>  </span>Cliff takes another swig of water and wedges the bottle between his thighs.<span>  </span>He taps his thumbs on the wheel and curls his lips around his teeth.<span>  </span>He sits there lipless, remembering.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Shane got really intense.<span>  </span>He took my hand and tried to force me to shoot myself.<span>  </span>I didn’t want to do it, but I was only ten and I wasn’t as strong as him.<span>  </span>Finally he managed to get me pinned beneath him, but he couldn’t hold me down and make me shoot at the same time.<span>  </span>The gun was actually a little ways off in the dirt. Shane said he’d only let me go if I shot him.<span>  </span>I haven’t ever told anyone this,” he says.<span>  </span>“It’s not really a story.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span> </span>“Well, I want to know what happens.<span>  </span>Did you shoot him in the leg?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Yes,” Cliff says. He curls his lips around his teeth again.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“You shot him in the leg.”<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I defrost Cliff from old photos I’ve seen of his childhood.<span>  </span>He’s in a yellow soccer jersey and he’s grinning, smashing his eyes to slits, a front tooth cockeyed, his cowlicks untamed.<span>  </span>I try adding a gun to the visual, but as soon as I do, the whole thing collapses.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I shot him in the leg. He picked up the gun and handed it to me then he turned around.<span>  </span>I got him in the back of the calf.”<span>  </span>Cliff hunches his shoulders.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I’m about to ask what it felt like, that moment the metal hit skin. But before I can ask, Cliff jerks the wheel to the right to take a turn.<span>  </span>“Is this what we’re looking for?” he asks.<span>  </span>Indeed, a green sign points the way.<span>  </span>The car flies over a series of potholes, causing us both to jolt forward.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Slow down,” I say.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“No kidding,” he says.<span>  </span>“Anyway.<span>  </span>Shane wanted me to touch his bleeding calf.<span>  </span>He grabbed my hand.<span>  </span>He just kept staring at me, like in a creepy way, romantic, sort of, like he was going to lean in.<span>  </span>And he was holding my hand.<span>  </span>So finally, I took a rock and punched him with it.”<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I can tell this is the part of the story, more than the gun, more than the creepy staring, that Cliff doesn’t like telling.<span>  </span>One side of his face looks cramped.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Shane didn’t do anything.<span>  </span>He just let go and covered his eye.<span>  </span>I walked back to the bus stop.<span>  </span>I had no money so I had to beg my way on.”<span>  </span>Cliff takes another mint.<span>  </span>The hollows happen. An ancient van looms in front of us and Cliff slows the car.<span>  </span>Someone has written <em>bite me you cougar</em> in the dirt on the back window.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“My mom broke up with Ray.<span>  </span>She said he drank too much.<span>  </span>And that was the end of Shane.<span>  </span>We never saw each other again.”<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">“I wonder what he’s doing now,” I say.<span>  </span>Cliff shrugs.<span>  </span>“Do you think he remembers it?” “Sure,” Cliff says.<span>  </span>“Wouldn’t you?”<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">And it’s true that these are the things you hold onto and don’t tell.<span>  </span>Because they’re weird, the wishes people make, the things we make come true.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“How come you’ve never told me that?” I ask.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“It’s not the kind of thing you tell,” he says.<span>  </span>I know what he means.<span>  </span>I take my thumb and run it over the prickly hair on his neck.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“It’s not such a bad story,” I say.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“You got worse?” he says.<span>  </span>I run my thumb over his neck again.<span>  </span>“Bite me you cougar,” Cliff says.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Do you know the story about the sibyl in the bottle?” I ask.<span>  </span>Cliff squints.<span>  </span>He shakes his head.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>I tell him about her, about how Apollo wants her then traps her.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">We sit quietly feeling each turn of the car.<span>  </span>The fall has frozen the air.<span>  </span>It has that particular quality of cool; it mutes the trees.<span>  </span>Even the bark looks grayer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“That’s a sad story,” Cliff says.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“There are a lot of sad stories,” I say.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Why didn’t she just sleep with him?” Cliff asks.<span>  </span>“He’s the sexiest god, right?”<span>  </span>I roll the bottle back and forth with my toe.<span>  </span>“What’s one thing I don’t know about you?” he asks.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>I’m not as good at things like this.<span>  </span>I can feel the feeling: that whirring sense of being unmoored by my own trespass.<span>  </span>But the only memory I have, the only one that fits this game, is one I don’t feel like telling.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“I used to step on ants outside and then try to heal them with Children’s Tylenol,” I say.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“That’s it?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“I once let a whole jar full of grasshoppers go in the living room.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Cliff shakes his head. <span> </span>“I’m never telling you anything again,” he says.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Okay, I know something.<span>  </span>I had a Spanish teacher in high school, Mr. Lombardi, who used to always threaten to give me a bad grade.<span>  </span>He said I was too quiet.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Hard to believe.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“My friend Kelsie said to go and talk to him.<span>  </span>She said if you went to talk with him, he’d be reasonable.<span>  </span>Kelsie was an awful student, but she always got As in Spanish.<span>  </span>Kelsie also had a big rack, to use your poetic phrasing.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Cliff smirks and brushes his eye with his hand.<span>  </span>One eyebrow sticks up, pointing to the dotted roof of the car.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“She was stacked,” I say.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“I get it,” Cliff says.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“But she was plain and none of the guys really liked her.<span>  </span>So anyways, I walked up to the door and the first thing I saw was Kelsie and Mr. Lombardi in the corner near the map of Mexico.<span>  </span>Then I saw that the map of Mexico was weirdly crinkled.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Uh oh.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Mr. Lombardi had both hands up her shirt.<span>  </span>Kelsie was sealed to the map, going up and down with his hands.<span>  </span>And she saw me.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“What a perv.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“I backed up and waited for her around the corner.<span>  </span>I said we should go to the principal.<span>  </span>That year we had a new principal, a woman.<span>  </span>I was excited to get Mr. Lombardi in trouble so I could avoid a C in Spanish.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“That’s why I love you.<span>  </span>Always thinking of others.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“But Kelsie said that if I told anyone, she would never speak to me again.<span>  </span>To this day, I’ve never seen anyone so certain, so—I don’t know—possessed.<span>  </span>She looked like this.”<span>  </span>I point to the lunging animal on the bag of chips.<span>  </span>“Years later, when we were both home for Winter Break, Kelsie told me that she lost her virginity to Mr. Lombardi on his daughter’s bed.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Gross,” Cliff says.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Yeah. She said she wished it would happen with him and it had.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“She wished to lose her virginity on the Spanish teacher’s daughter’s bed?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“I guess.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“So what’s the moral of your story?” Cliff asks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“What’s the moral of yours?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Cliff shrugs.<span>  </span>“Don’t take the bus,” he says.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“I never took another language class,” I say.<span>  </span>“Even in college.<span>  </span>I stayed away.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Is that the moral?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Does there have to be a moral?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I roll the window down.<span>  </span>Clouds are creeping in from the west. My sister, Kate, says that every year, people from the coasts go into the Rockies, the Sandias, the Jemez, and they don’t know about flash floods or lightning.<span>  </span>They bring cheese and specialty bars wrapped in foil, then wham, they’re dead.<span>  </span>She told me this when she came to hike in these very mountains.<span>  </span>It’s as though, by acknowledging this, she avoids that fate.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Does knowing help?<span>  </span>Sibyls are supposed to see into the future.<span>  </span>Couldn’t this one?<span>  </span>When she said no to Apollo, she didn’t see herself trapped in the bottle, wishing to die?<span>  </span>Or was that <em>why </em>she didn’t sleep with Apollo?<span>  </span>Did she know that the outside world, from the captivity within glass would glow brighter and brighter?<span>  </span>That because of the glass, the world inside of her would go vivid with longing and despair?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">In the distance, I see a yellow stand of aspens, but the car turns into some thick juniper and cottonwoods and they disappear.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Do you think he wanted to put something in or get something out?” I ask.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“What?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Do you think the point was to make a scar or to let something out, through the skin.<span>  </span>You know, like bloodletting.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Shane?”<span>  </span>Cliff moves his head slowly in a no.<span>  </span>“I couldn’t tell you.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>The wine bottle rolls under the seat and hits something metal.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span><span> </span>“If Apollo gave you one wish, what would you wish for?” I ask.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“To not have to sleep with Apollo,” Cliff says.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“I might wish for a baby.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Cliff looks at me sideways.<span>  </span>“It would come out half-god,” he says.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“It would come out, though.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Yes,” he says.<span>  </span>“I suppose so.<span>  </span>But maybe through the crown of your head.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“A baby for every grain of sand.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“A baby for every turning tree,” he says, “and you would be one busy woman.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>And then there they are, yellow as a room of canaries.<span>  </span>This is what they do at the end of their season—yelp this color into the desert sky, then send it scattering to the red ground.<span>  </span>Cliff parks the car under a stand of them.<span>  </span>I open the door.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Look at that,” Cliff says, pointing to a rainstorm of leaves, sent sailing with a wind.<span>  </span>His brow relaxes.<span>  </span>In typical desert fashion, the blue sky of the morning has transformed to dark clouds.<span>  </span>There will be storms tonight. The trees will go silver with winter.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Cliff’s mom told me about a client once, a fourteen-year-old girl dying of leukemia.<span>  </span>I was sitting on the sofa after brunch, stuffed to the gills, watching a cartoon and she just told me, out of the blue.<span>  </span>All this girl wanted was for a particular boy to come to her bedside.<span>  </span>She talked of nothing else.<span>  </span>But when the girl’s friends finally dragged the boy there, the girl wouldn’t look at him.<span>  </span>She was embarrassed by the state of her skin.<span>  </span>Then she died.<span>  </span>Connie finished this story, slapped her thighs, and got up to clean some counters.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Cliff arches his back.<span>  </span>“Let’s walk,” he says.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“It’s going to storm.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I know,” he says.<span>  </span>Far off over another set of hills, the first lightning flashes.<span>  </span>The wind moves slowly.<span>  </span>The world seems to shiver under its big hand.<span>  </span>Families in colorful jackets pack their cars, fleeing the mountains.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Cliff closes his door, but I wait, caught for a moment.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I try not to think about it, this one thing.<span>  </span>The memory—even just a hint of it—makes my skin cringe all at once, like a sheet ripped from the line.<span>  </span>I was ten when my mother decided to foster Derrick.<span>  </span>My father had just left us—a trial separation everyone knew would last.<span>  </span>My mother needed a project.<span>  </span>I’m not sure how we qualified; maybe she lied on the forms, maybe she and my father had interviewed before he left.<span>  </span>Derrick was fourteen, skinny and big-eyed.<span>  </span>He’d been beaten up at the group home, probably because of his willowy build, the way his hands tapered like a girl’s. He arrived with a black eye and a brown duffle bag.<span>  </span>My mother set him up in the room that used to be my father’s study.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">In the first weeks, Derrick drew into himself like a sea snail snatched from its rock.<span>  </span>And his silence lured out of my mother a warm, maternal heat.<span>  </span>“How was school?” she’d ask him in a way that she never asked me, her eyes damp and curious, her mouth parted in anticipation.<span>  </span>He’d mumble fine, and try and walk away, but she’d try harder, following him with questions about his homework, his school supplies, sports, and friends.<span>  </span>She urged me to sit next to him at dinner, to ask him to go swimming at the Y.<span>  </span>She assigned the two of us chores to do in tandem—planting a berry patch out back, reorganizing the pots beneath the stove.<span>  </span>When he wasn’t around, she asked me my opinion.<span>  </span>How did I think he was doing?<span>  </span>Did he say anything to me about being happy or sad?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">It makes sense to me now.<span>  </span>She wasn’t playing favorites.<span>  </span>She was trying to make up for the world’s bad temper, compensate for Derrick’s hard luck, put some pennies in his cosmic bank. She must have known, as I didn’t, that his mother wouldn’t get out of jail, that Derrick would spend the next years in a world of unstable charity.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Derrick stayed away from me as much as he could.<span>  </span>He understood that he was treading on someone else’s turf.<span>  </span>If I came in to talk to my mother while the two of them watched television, he’d get up and go to his room.<span>  </span>Once—how this came to pass, I can’t recall—he let me sit on his bed and read the comic books he stored in the nightstand.<span>  </span>He stood at the mirror and asked me if he should cut off the long floppy bangs that shielded his eyes.<span>  </span>I liked him in that moment.<span>  </span>I felt important—let into a world of older kids and their concerns.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">My mother tried and tried.<span>  </span>She bought him new shirts, the baggy shorts all the boys were wearing, even a skateboard. But she couldn’t quite get him to relax.<span>  </span>He ate his meals quietly and rinsed his plate.<span>  </span>He kept all his clothes neatly stacked in the drawers, his duffle bag folded atop the dresser.<span>  </span>It was as if he expected, at any moment, to have to leave.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">One Saturday, a couple of months after he arrived, she told me she wanted to take him out to the lake, just the two of them.<span>  </span>Nature might do him good.<span>  </span>I’d understand, right?<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I went to my friend Jenny’s house, but I remember the feeling of that day so clearly.<span>  </span>I was a ringing thing, a bell chiming out into a windy sky.<span>  </span>Jenny left me in her bedroom, confused by my unwillingness to play, and I quietly ripped the tail off a stuffed squirrel near her bed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">That night, my mother tucked me in.<span>  </span>I tried to tell her about it, that I didn’t feel well, that I’d ripped Jenny’s toy squirrel and hidden it in a closet.<span>  </span>“You’ll survive, sweetie,” she said, and patted my head.<span>  </span>I wasn’t even finished talking when she called me a trooper and left the room.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">It began again, the feeling of being a bell in a big wind.<span>  </span>I waited until I heard her close the door to her bathroom, turn on the faucet, open a drawer.<span>  </span>The tile was cold under my feet.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“What’s wrong?” she asked.<span>  </span>Her mouth was bare of lipstick, flecked with the faintest white toothpaste.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I could have said that I missed her.<span>  </span>That I missed my dad. That every penny I threw into the well at the mall was about them, about having them back.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">But instead, I twisted my hands together.<span>  </span>I said that Derrick came into my room at night.<span>  </span>I watched her face contract, then loosen into a surface as smooth as a plate.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“What?” she asked.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“He touches himself,” I said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">My mother knelt down, staring into my eyes.<span>  </span>“Are you telling me the truth?” she asked.<span>  </span>I could have burst into tears, admitted my lie. I nodded.<span>  </span>She tucked my hair away from my cheek.<span>  </span>“Did he touch you?” she asked, her voice a strong whisper.<span>  </span>I shook my head.<span>  </span>She kept her hand on my cheek.<span>  </span>She closed her eyes.<span>  </span>Then she reached out and pulled me to her, smoothing the back of my head.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I’m sorry,” she said, finally.<span>  </span>“I’m sorry.<span>  </span>Sometimes people go through things inside that they don’t show everyone.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">She walked me to bed and held my hand and the heat from it seemed to shoot directly into my face.<span>  </span>“I didn’t know,” she whispered.<span>  </span>“I didn’t know.”<span>  </span>I knew she was crying, though I’d shut my eyes so tightly, the silver eyespots swarmed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Derrick was gone that afternoon.<span>  </span>Drawers and closet empty, borrowed bed turned on its side.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">My mother returned to me.<span>  </span>I got her back.<span>  </span>She never fostered another child.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">What did Derrick think when my mother drove him back to the social worker?<span>  </span>Left him there with his duffel and an envelope of money?<span>  </span>I don’t know if my mother explained her reasons, or if she simply said she wasn’t cut out for raising other people’s kids.<span>  </span>In twenty-four years, we’ve never uttered his name—as if we can make him disappear from our past.<span>  </span>As if by acting like the world can’t hurt us, we will make it so.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I’m still in the car.<span>  </span>A roll of thunder, then a clap.<span>  </span>The noise happens once in the sky, then silently with feeling through the earth. I open the door, stand in the cool wind.<span>  </span>I didn’t bring a raincoat and within seconds, the shoulders of my shirt are soaked through.<span>  </span>Cliff’s hair is flat against his skull.<span>  </span>He looks out into the gray and red, into the yellow and silver.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span> </span>The rain is loud, falling against the wood, the dirt, the trees, my face.<span>  </span>When drops hit the dusty trail, they stay risen like tiny bunkers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Cliff’s walking away from me, down into the trees.<span>  </span>His body’s small against the bleak view of peaks and I feel a wash of gratitude—for him, for the air and trees.<span>  </span>A clump of leaves lands near my foot, layers of yellow and brown.<span>  </span>I grab a handful and squeeze.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The truth is, if I had one wish right now, if I could wish on a handful of leaves—for baby Josephina, eternal life, eternal youth, domestic peace, a love that would never stray from me, never end—well, I’ve listened closely.<span>  </span>I know what happens.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span> </span>I wouldn’t wish for anything at all.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I drop the leaves and lock the door.<span>  </span>Cliff gets smaller and smaller.<span>  </span>And then I follow him down the dust paths turning to mud, into the brown, silver and yellow, into the crashing storm.<span>  </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>That day in July my mom came out of the house, wiped her soapy hands on her thighs, and told me to get my lazy bum up off the grass and go weed the peas. She wore rolled-up blue jeans, a cotton blouse, and a red bandana that tied her dark hair back from her face. Her toenails were caked with dirt and needed cutting.</p>
<p>“Don’t want to,” I said. My dad had been gone on a job for a week and it was just the two of us. In the sun the temperature read ninety; bugs swarmed around my skin and flies landed intermittently on my thighs and knees.</p>
<p>“Katie, how’d you get to be so lazy?” she said, squinting off towards the hills that used to belong to my dad’s parents, but had since been sold, and then started walking alone through the tall grass down to the garden. I watched her thin shoulder blades moving under her blouse and went back to the library book I was reading. It was about a girl who lived in a clean house in the suburbs with lots of rooms and windows. The girl wrote stories, and the book was about those stories she wrote and all those windows. I wanted to be like her: unencumbered, surrounded by light. In one story she wrote about girls who turned into birds: hawks and ravens and buzzards and crows. They could fly anywhere they wanted to go. You knew, reading, that the girl who wrote the stories was free, too, you could feel it in your bones, but I couldn’t concentrate anymore, with my skinny mom walking down to the garden alone.</p>
<p>I felt a trickle of sweat slip down my spine and thought about those weeds—tall, green, stringy—crowding out the tomatoes and peas and carrots and beans. I thought about our basement full of empty canning jars collecting dust and our Datsun with a busted starter. After a few minutes I got up and went down the hill too, kneeling down in front of the carrots and pigweed. My mom didn’t say a thing, just looked at me sideways for a moment and smiled, then went back to the peas.<br />
We lived in a house that didn’t have many windows: just a few small double-hungs in each room that we covered with plastic in winter. My dad had built the house when he was twenty: a pine-sided cabin with two bedrooms and a porch and a barn where he had hoped, someday, to keep horses. Now that barn was just a place with no walls where we kept snow tires and broken lawnmowers and old chairs that needed caning.</p>
<p>The weeds were thick and everywhere: pigweed and witch grass and dandelion. It had rained all of June and standing water pooled in-between the rows and mosquito eggs floated around in the pools. But that day was all sun. My hair fell into my face and stuck to my cheeks and the thin brown hairs on my legs shone. Wet dirt wedged under my nails and made them throb. The skin on my arms and legs burned. My mom’s arms were a nice freckled brown and she didn’t sweat. Mine were my dad’s: pink and burnable.</p>
<p>“Sing low, sweet chariot,” my mom sang, quietly and out of key. She had grown up in a big house in the suburbs, just like the girl in my book, and could have done anything with her life. Back in college she had wanted to be a poet. There were floppy books of poetry stored on a shelf in the corner of her bedroom, collecting dust. I got up and moved to the shade. I lay down and closed my eyes and thought about how a Coke or a blue Slush Puppy or a sip of my dad’s cold beer would feel on my tongue. I could hear my mom inching along through the rows. I picked a blade of grass and stuck it between my teeth and nibbled on it, let the bitter taste seep all over and then I spit it out and just lay there, feeling the cool.</p>
<p>I had the story of how they met like a movie in my mind. My dad had a job at the local college building storage sheds. It was hot and he worked with his shirt off and all the girls hung around, my mom told me, pretending to read near where he cut and hammered boards. But she was the only one to offer him a beer. He said he’d love one but swimming was an even better way to cool down. Then he winked. “You like to swim?”</p>
<p>He took her to a place in the Broad Brook called Indian Love Call and told her it was named that because Indians would bring their girlfriends there. On one side of the river a ledge outcrop rose twenty feet above the water and they carried their beers up to that rock and looked down. The water bristled with snowmelt and the boulders flashed silver in the sun. He beat his fists against his chest and made a hooting call meant to imitate an Indian and his voice echoed back. Then he took off all his clothes and leapt into the water. My mom stood there in her bohemian skirt and blouse looking down at him. He crowed and hollered and splashed and looked up at her. She laughed. “What you waiting for?” he called out.</p>
<p>“It looks cold,” she shouted above the sound of water hitting stone.</p>
<p>“Fresh!” he yelled, so my mom took off all her clothes and jumped in too. She’d never been naked in front of a man or leapt off a cliff into ice water; she said she knew right then, in midair, her life would be something entirely different than what she had imagined. I learned all this one night in the dark of my room, moonlight lighting up the side of her face as she told me.</p>
<p>“You all done?” My mom stood up, brushed her dark hair out of her face with the back of her hand and looked down at me on the grass.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Pooped,” I said, so we walked back up to the house together. The sun had settled below the trees and the sky bloomed tangerine behind the leaves. She was too thin. Lacking muscle. “Eat, woman,” my dad would say, poking her ribs. “What, you want to float away?”</p>
<p>She put some rice on the stove and started chopping kale. Every once in a while she’d glance up at the old-fashioned clock that hung on our wall and made a loud ticking sound I knew so well sometimes I couldn’t hear it when I tried. On top of the clock sat little wooden turtles and rabbits and birds my dad had carved for both of us years ago.</p>
<p>She looked again at the clock. It said seven-thirty, which meant my dad should have been back a few hours ago, which meant he and Bill, the guy he built houses with, had either broken down or were drinking six packs at the river.</p>
<p>She licked her dry lips and looked at the door. It had warped over the years and now a half-inch gap of outside light shone between the door and the frame. Once she had asked him to fix it so he took some duct tape and pasted a strip over the gap. “There,” he said, grinning, laying the duct tape on the table. The strip of tape still hung there, half peeled down, the sticky part dull with cobwebs.</p>
<p>My mom turned the tap water on and the light over the kitchen sink flickered. She had asked him for real electricity too, not the long cord strung from tree to tree through the woods up from his parents’ house that made the lights flicker every time she used the blender or ran water.  My dad just laughed and left the room when she asked for that.</p>
<p>I heard his truck coming up the driveway and went outside. When I was young we had driven that red Ford to Florida where we had camped in a tent surrounded by sand pines and cooked on a Coleman stove and my mom’s skin had turned a beautiful brown; there are pictures. There’s also a picture I took of the two of them dancing barefoot in sand, my mom’s neck tipped back in laughter.</p>
<p>My dad hopped out of the truck and came towards me. “There’s my beauty!” he called out, scooping me up and swinging me around in a circle. His eyes were bloodshot and he was grinning. He set me down and looked at the house. “How’s Lyn?”</p>
<p>We walked inside together. She didn’t look up, just kept chopping her vegetables, the knife making little scratching sounds on the board. “And beauty number two,” he said, quiet, breathing.</p>
<p>He went around the counter to where she stood and put his arms around her waist, placed his thumbs on her hipbones. “I said hello, beautiful,” he said into her ear. Then he looked at me, his eyes glistening. He was drunk, I could tell. I loved him when he was drunk; he talked to both of us this way.  My mom stopped chopping her vegetables and closed her eyes. The cotton of her shirt went up and down with her breath. Then she pushed him away with her elbow. “Go take a shower.”</p>
<p>We ate dinner at the table out in the yard: rice and greens and a can of pintos my mom opened up. She didn’t even heat them on the stove, just dumped a pile onto each of our plates. My dad got a six-pack from his truck and opened one and told us about his week. He told my mom this was the biggest house they’d ever built, that he was going to make a profit. “I’ll buy you any god-damn thing you want,” he said, grinning, leaning over and pinching my thigh.</p>
<p>My mom poured some white wine into a Bell canning jar. She took small sips and squinted out towards the view. She was doing that thing she did, I knew: trying, with her eyes, to make the hills flat, pretty. Turn them into poetry. They used to belong to my dad’s parents. Now they were just black silhouettes spotted in ugly houses, the sky behind them the blue of his and my eyes.</p>
<p>He set his beer down and looked at my mom. “Okay few days, Lyn?”</p>
<p>She took another sip of her wine. “It was alright.”</p>
<p>Their faces were just shadows. My dad leaned down and unlaced his boots, slid his feet out, rested them up on the bench between us. They were pretty like a woman’s: pale from being inside his boots all the time.</p>
<p>My mom got up and cleared the plates and took them into the kitchen. I heard water running and the kitchen light flickered. Mosquitoes swarmed around my head and bit my legs. I let one turn red with blood and then I swatted it so it left a smear on my thigh.</p>
<p>“Ugly,” my dad said, and laughed, but it was an out of proportion laugh, like he was laughing at something much funnier or not funny at all. I sat there waiting for another mosquito to land on me and fill up with blood. I thought about the girl in my book and how she didn’t think about her parents spent dreams, or weed their gardens; all she thought about was the people in the stories she wrote and herself.</p>
<p>“How about you, Katie Belle,” my dad whispered. That’s what he called me. “Doing okay?”</p>
<p>The back door slammed and I went around the side of the house. My mom was going down the hill to the garden in the near dark. She kneeled by the zucchini this time, pulling more weeds, trying to make things right. It was a losing battle; I knew. I followed and stood quiet in the shadows a few yards away. After a few minutes she stopped weeding and bent over and put her face in her hands. Her shoulders started to shake. I looked at the view and then at my toes and then back at her. The shadows of her shoulder blades started moving around under her skin. The skin of her back stretched out until it was gleaming, nearly translucent. Large pointy things, the length of my legs, began moving around, poking through her ribs and skin.</p>
<p>“Mom,” I called out, my voice too loud in that dark.</p>
<p>She looked up at me. Her eyes hazy, viscous, blank. Those things on her back were iridescent, dark feathered wings.</p>
<p>Then a look of recognition passed through her. “Oh. Hi.” Those wings disappeared. Stopped pulsing there. She had been crying but she looked beautiful. “Want to help, Kate?”</p>
<p>My heart was electric but I went and knelt next to her. It was the only thing I knew how to do. We pulled until it was so dark we could no longer tell the difference between one thing and another: unearthing spinach and carrots and beans. A firefly flew into her blouse and started blinking in there. She laughed and tugged the cotton away from her chest and the bug flew out. Then she put her arms around me and held me to her. She smelled like dish soap and earth, but something strange and sour that I’d never smelled before, too. All around us crickets were finding their partners. I thought about my dad up there drunk at that table and how I’d always be like him: wingless, from here.</p>
<p>“You cold?” she asked. She started shaking and I could feel those wings again, behind me, trembling under the surface of her skin.</p>
<p>“No,” I lied. The night air was warm but I was freezing. Only where she touched me was I warm. Her breath was sour, uneven, scented of wine. On the horizon the moon started to come up through the trees: just a sliver, then disappeared behind the tops of the hemlocks and the pines.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Late in Queen Victoria’s century, a young Jesuit seminarian set the following entry  down  in his notebook:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;April 27, 1871&#8230;.Mesmerized a duck with chalk lines drawn from her beak sometimes level and sometimes forward on a black table. They explain that the bird keeping the abiding offscape of the hand gripping her neck fancies she is still held down and cannot lift her head as long as she looks at the chalk line, which she associates with the power that holds her . This duck lifted her head at once when I put it down on the table without chalk. But this seems inadequate. It is most likely the fascinating instress of the straight white stroke.&#8221; <a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Most of us will recognize the author of these lines thanks to those gorgeously inscrutable bits about “the abiding offscape of the hand” and the “fascinating instress.” They are in part the evidence of Gerard Manley Hopkins trying his damndest not to be a poet. Before he came to study at the Jesuit College of Stonyhurst, he had burned all of his youthful verse, regarding it as a distraction from his true calling to the priesthood. But as we know, Hopkins was unsuccessful in his desire to resist the poetry itch. A few years into the future he will give up his efforts to suppress his creative urges (he was apparently much more successful at suppressing the sexual ones, but that’s another story), and break his long poetic silence with the most unreadable great poem in the language, “The Wreck of the Deutschland.” From that point on, Hopkins would be a majestic poet but a mediocre priest. During his Stonyhurst years, he can’t write poetry, but he can certainly write like a poet in his notebooks.  He watches a field of bluebells waver in the light, comparing them to “the spots on a snake.” He goes ga-ga over a peacock’s train, as mesmerized by its finery as his duck was by the chalk line: he feels himself being stared at by a thousand eyes that “fall into irregular rows” when the peacock spreads his train. When the peacock lowers his train, he likens the eyes to “scales or gadroons.”  <em>Gadroons!—</em>an architectural term for “a band of convex molding ornamentally carved with beading or reeding.” The description goes on&#8211;lavish, maniacal, ecstatic: “the outermost eyes, detached and singled, give with their corner fringes the suggestion of that inscape of the flowing cusped trefoil” that he has seen in certain paintings. None of this makes us see the peacock anew; the passage doesn’t <em>make the familiar strange</em>; it’s too fastidiously wacky. Descriptions such as this, like so many passages in Hopkins’ poems, have little to do with accuracy of seeing—there are no images akin to Bishop’s characterization of fireflies looking <em>exactly</em> like champagne bubbles—but everything to do with <em>intensity </em>of seeing. No one else has seen the world quite like Hopkins; he out-surreals the surrealists. Yes, the purpose of this looking is devotional, evidence that the world is charged (and charged and charged) with the grandeur of God, a pantheism that many of his fellow Jesuits would have found a bit heretical. Be that as it may, the immediate effect of reading Hopkins’ encounter with his duck is plain, visceral, jaw-dropping astonishment. It may not bring me to a greater closeness with the Almighty, but it somehow helps to restore my faith in the things of this world—what bizarre delights it offers!—and my faith that a writer can see this bizarreness so uniquely is similarly restored. I may not hear Louis Armstrong rasping about what a wonderful world this is, but the mere fact that Hopkins <em>hypnotized a duck</em> and thought enough of the action to record it—for himself, if not for posterity—is enthralling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, neither we nor Hopkins are ever content to let sleeping ducks lie. Hopkins immediately seeks to explain the whole business. Some unnamed “they”—experts on duck hypnosis, presumably&#8211;have gone before him in this experiment, and the duck seems to associate the chalk line with the power of the unseen hand that held it down. We see Hopkins mulling this theory over. Clearly part of him is inclined to give it some credence, and we suspect it is because the possibilities of religious allegory are so obvious: God is the hand and we are the ducks. Even unseen and when not overtly wielding His power, His Hand Hath Stroked our feathers. If you leap to this interpretation (and Hopkins was certainly likely to have done so) that invisible hand seems both a burden and a consolation. This ambivalence is precisely the one explored in one of the greatest lyrics of our language’s other essential devotional poet—George Herbert in “The Collar,” who initially sees his clerical collar as not much different from a yoke put on an oxen. So Hopkins is God’s Duck, Herbert God’s Ox. Yet at the same time, Hopkins is questioning this whole premise. “This seems inadequate. It is most likely the fascinating instress of the straight white stroke.” I take this to be Hopkins lingo for saying that duck finds the chalk line pretty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inadequate it seems to me, too, much as I love this notebook entry. And so I recently wrote to my friends Dawn Cooper, who is an internationally recognized animal trainer, and her husband the novelist and poet Clint McCown.  I quoted the notebook entry, wanting to see what they thought of what the subject line of my email called, “the duck thing-y.” Here’s Clint’s reply:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dawn wrote out an explanatory email about the duck thingy, but it got devoured by the universe when she tried to send it to me.  So I&#8217;ll summarize as best I can from what she told me.</p>
<p>She said research has been done on ducks that connects visual stimuli to involuntary physical responses.  She surmises (by piecing together five or six separate studies) that somehow their optic receptors can lock onto something like a white line because it can be mistaken by their little duck brains for markings on a duck of the opposite sex and they freeze into a particular duck pose&#8211;head lowered in submission to show willingness to get together and have baby ducks.  So as weird as it sounds, a duck&#8217;s brain seems to be hardwired for forcing the body to strike and hold a particular pose if confronted with a white line stimulus.  I guess a white line is the equivalent of duck porn.  So as strange as the Hopkins passage is, it falls within the realm of what has actually been observed and studied in ducks.</p>
<p>What a world. Hopkins thinks it&#8217;s all about God, scientists think it&#8217;s all about sex.  I think it&#8217;s all about design flaws.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, dear reader, it gets curiouser and curiosuer. A few days later, I encounter the following passage by another author, one also much concerned with religion and wildlife:</p>
<blockquote><p>Great day w/bear management wildlife biologists; much to see in wild territory incl amazing creatures w/mama bears&#8217; gutteral raw instinct to protect &amp; provide for her young… She sees danger? She brazenly rises up on strong hind legs, growls Don&#8217;t Touch My Cubs &amp; the species survives &amp; mama bear doesn&#8217;t look 2 anyone else 2 hand her anything; biologists say she works harder than males, is provider/protector for the future…Yes it was another outstanding day in AK seeing things the rest of America should see; applicable life lessons we&#8217;re blessed to see firsthand. <a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>This is a Tweet posted from her Blackberry by Sarah Palin, not long before she resigns her position as Governor of Alaska in favor of whatever future career she is plotting for herself. There is obviously a desire on the governor’s part to identify herself with the mother Grizzly, rearing up menacingly to protect her young  from the lampoons of insidious Leftist Antichrists such as David Letterman, or from attacks by various disgruntled State Troopers, Levi Johnstons, and former McCain staffers. She manages, too, to put in a plug for Alaska tourism and a dig at the wimps who reside in the lower forty-eight, all in the space of a passage that, if you’re counting, is only three words longer than Hopkins’ duck opus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The differences between these two authors go without saying: one is a genius, by all accounts a tortured, deeply insecure, and deeply humble soul. The other is cunning, crafty, but by no means a genius and by no means humble. But is it equally obvious to state an even more troubling contrast between the two passages: one is set down for the writer’s private consumption, edification, and insight (or inscape, to use Hopkins-speak); it is set down in a bound paper notebook, in the pencil that Hopkins favored over ink, and in a hand that one of Hopkins’ editors complains is “minute….frequently smudged, and at times almost illegible.” Illegible, perhaps, but also <em>tangible</em>, designed so that the eyes may see what the hand has done, to paraphrase Robert Lowell. The other is spewed out, presumably <em>in situ</em>: the Governor rearranges her bobby pins as Mama Grizzly snarls, as the park ranger warns that they’d better make a run for it, and as they do she still is furiously texting on her Blackberry, employing all the irritating mannerisms of text-speak rather than the glorious oddity of Hopkins-speak: the ampersands, the number two substituted for “to,” the almost-Teutonic tic for compound nouns like “provider/protector.” And these musings are going out in real time to her equally demented worshipful minions. Texting of this sort is purely a mode of self-gratifying  performance: it has little to do with more intimate and authentic communication. Buddy in Orange County is watching it all unfold on his computer screen, to which he’s affixed a “NoBama” sticker. “Come here right now, Edna,” he’s telling his wife, “Sarah’s being trailed by a Grizzly!” Yes, it’s absurd, but it’s also demagoguery. Experience is turned to fodder for the blogosphere, and the import of the message is twisted and xenophobic, following in the tradition of the barefaced paranoia of Father Coglin’s radio rants of the 1930s, or Pound’s lunatic radio speeches from Mussolini’s Rome. No, Blackberrying will not cause you to think like Sarah Palin, let alone like poor old Ez. But what I want to offer in these pages is a kind of homage the force behind Hopkins’ stubby pencil and his cramped inscrutable cursive. I want to offer what I fear is an elegy to the handwritten word, as it’s set down in a unlined blank bound sketchbook, or the green lined pages of a pocket-sized moleskine, or a yellow legal pad, or a Blue Octavo of the sort that was so dear to Kafka. I want us to praise the notebook—both in and of itself and for what it tells us about the workings of a poet’s mind, and for how it helps us to chart the process of inspiration turning to what in time becomes a finished poem. I seek to make this offering before the handwritten notebook becomes yet another “dead format,” and before the kind of discourse, inclusiveness and attentiveness which is can represent disappears entirely from our consciousness. And make no mistake, reader, this disappearance is inevitable. We will still write our observations and our poems on some form of media, but as our methods change our consciousness will change as well, and not always to the good. Give me Hopkins’ duck, and let the Grizzly use her “gutteral raw instinct” to sense that genuine danger lurks within that black thing with the tiny keyboard in the human female’s hands. Seize it from her now, Great Beast; give her a chance to flee, but then tear those microchips to shreds with your claws.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t make me out to be a Luddite here. I suppose you could say my stance toward this whole business is Janus-like. As I write this, I can turn to my bookshelf and see a stack of bound notebooks, going back to the mid-1980s. (There are a good many others in storage in the attic and in the closet of my office at school…) I fill one, or sometimes two of them per year. Like many writers, my choice of materials to write with derives from habit, superstition and compulsion. I’m not as anal retentive as Thomas Mann, who would not do <em>any </em>writing before a visit to his manicurist, nor or as charmingly sweet-tempered as Keats, who would always put on his best suit before embarking on a letter or poem. But I am set in my ways: I can only write on black, hard-bound, 8 1/2 x 11 unlined artists’ sketch books. For many years I preferred to write with a black micro-point felt marker called (embarrassingly) “Le Pen.” Since these are now hard to find, I now make do with another felt marker—the Uniball Vision Unique. I write nothing in cursive, since I often can’t read my own left-handed scrawl, a problem I attribute to the Catholic Church: in second grade, my parents sent me to parochial school for a year. I’d learned to print with my left hand, but a nun named Sister Immaculata forbade the use of what she termed The Devil’s Side, and I was forced to make do with my right hand. This, among other things, ended my parents’ flirtation with private schooling, and the following year I went back to the public school and the Devil’s Hand. But the damage was done: my cursive always looks like gibberish. I must confess that I love the way the notebooks occupy their couple of feet of bookshelf space, along with several black spring binders filled with finished or abandoned poems. (These binders, like Le Pens, are now somewhat hard to get hold of; I’m told that only one company&#8211;Elbe-Cisco of Fall River, MA—continues to manufacture them.) Yet the notebooks are propped up not by a bookend, but by a Bose Soundock on which the newer of my two i-Pods rests (The first ran out of space for my music library, and its 164 GB successor is loading up fast.) And of course the words you are reading are being typed out on a laptop, from which I’ve just called up my friend Clint’s Duck Thing-y email and pasted it onto my text, along with Palin’s insufferable Tweet. I am also calling up the archives of the online journal <em>Blackbird—</em>in part because they contain a brilliant uncollected poem by the late Larry Levis that I plan to paste into my text as well, in part because the archives also contain a video, c. 1992 or thereabouts, of Levis reading the poem (that I will play while the i-Pod is also chiming out the Drive By-Truckers), and in part because the poem will testify that I am not alone in my Janus-like condition regarding new media vs. old.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Levis poem is entitled “Poem Ending With a Hotel on Fire.” It is close to six pages in length, and, like so many of Levis’ later efforts, it is something of a loose baggy monster. The poem veers from seemingly improvisational free association to an almost-prophetic self-possession. Here’s the opening passage:</p>
<blockquote><p>Poor means knowing the trees couldn&#8217;t care less</p>
<p>Whether you carve the initials of your enemies</p>
<p>All over the trunk&#8217;s white bark,<br />
Or whether this sleep beneath them is your last.</p>
<p>In the contorted figures meant to represent their sleep,<br />
The statistics never show the deep shade in the park,</p>
<p>The mother appearing in the dark of someone within whose<br />
Sprawled arms clear gin and black tar mingle<br />
To compose the blood&#8217;s unwriteable psalm.</p>
<p>The blackening church bells say the poor are wrong,<br />
So does the traffic stalling on the bridge; so does the lazy swirl<br />
Of current underneath it all, a smile fading in the dark.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>What I love is the way you would whisper against<br />
The current, into the dark,</p>
<p>&#8220;But what you mean by <em>poor </em>is…some figure &amp; concealment<br />
By which they are forgotten. But the figure itself is a kind</p>
<p>Of poverty. I don&#8217;t mean just…money. I mean poverty</p>
<p>In the widest possible…<em>sense.</em>&#8221; There was the sound</p>
<p>Of crickets in a ravine I listened to so closely one evening</p>
<p>It became only a vast chirring, then a thing not there, then</p>
<p>The roar of a fire. It was like being, or pretending to be,</p>
<p>Without speech. To be without speech means no one<br />
Listening, &amp; that the flames scaling the neighborhood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like mirrors</p>
<p>Can not even pretend to. This is</p>
<p>Where the poor are not permitted to see themselves…
</p></blockquote>
<p>We can’t help but hear the voice of Hopkins in Levis’ strangely numinous descriptions of “the vast chirring of the crickets” and “the blood’s unwriteable psalm.” But the poem is about protest rather than praise, lamenting impoverishment as both a social injustice and a spiritual condition. It also seems to be a poem of lost love, describing a “you” who appears to be both a real individual and a muse figure. The poem continues on for several stanzas before introducing its first moment of sustained narrative. With a third of the poem finished, we are finally told of the hotel fire alluded to in the title:</p>
<blockquote><p>Once in a hotel in Cincinnati, I saw a woman decorated,</p>
<p>Like a kind of human Christmas tree, in money. All down<br />
the buttons of her blouse &amp; in fact all over her blouse &amp; skirt,</p>
<p>The men, for whom, I heard later, she had been hired as<br />
A private dancer, had pinned twenties, hundreds, fifties,</p>
<p>Rolls of smaller bills—&amp; as the alarm blared its one note &amp;</p>
<p>The beige smoke—billowy, calm signature of whoever had set<br />
The upper floors on fire—began filling</p>
<p>The corridor, we arrived at the elevator in the same<br />
Moment, &amp; waited—I in shorts &amp; a faded t-shirt with three</p>
<p>Naked Jamaicans on it who were, once, <em>The Itals,</em><br />
And she in the most expensive dress I had ever seen—</p>
<p>And when the elevator didn&#8217;t show we ran down the steel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &amp; concrete</p>
<p>Stairs that seemed to ring and ring with our steps.</p>
<p>Later, in the lobby bar, her purse so stuffed with bills<br />
The bartender simply said, &#8220;It&#8217;s cool,&#8221; &amp; raised both hands</p>
<p>Above his head when we tried to pay, she would talk only<br />
Of her one obsession, which had nothing to do with money nor</p>
<p>Swaying to music, nor men,</p>
<p>But with purebred Abyssinian cats, the trouble she went to,</p>
<p>Taking them—traveling with four howling cages behind her<br />
In the back of a station wagon—to shows all over</p>
<p>The Midwest. The worst part though, she said, was that<br />
The shows were rigged, the judges were paid off….</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anecdote of the fire and the speaker’s subsequent encounter with the woman is as consummately outlandish as the poem’s free-associative opening. As the speaker continues his conversation with her, she seems progressively more demented, claiming, among other things, that the corrupt cat show judges have even tried to frame her on murder charges. But then the narrative shifts again. We’re given a lengthy description of a gang of drugged-out teenagers as they set the hotel ablaze in a kind of warped prank. The description of the conflagration is grimly humorous, lushly detailed, and, well, pyrotechnical.  And the passage leaves us completely unprepared for the tonal shift which occurs when the dancer returns to the story. Now the poem reverts to the associative method of its opening. As the poem concludes, the imagery is militantly (but eccentrically) apocalyptic:</p>
<blockquote><p>…the doors opened onto flames.</p>
<p>In the photographs she showed me the Abyssinians looked</p>
<p>Emaciated, &amp;, though I couldn&#8217;t say why, like a species that<br />
Had survived its own extinction. Their pale eyes suggested</p>
<p>Nothing at all. They looked back like the face of famine,</p>
<p>Their thin, ridged spines older than even the ancient<br />
Illustrations of cats on tombs, cats that had been the pets</p>
<p>Of kings &amp; now slept beside them in the straight-jacketed,<br />
Dry, whirlpool of bandages they had wrapped kings in so that</p>
<p>They might descend without distractions. Did the doors<br />
Of tombs open onto flames? The faces of the cats<br />
Caught in the photographs would never tell.</p>
<p>Their gray fur was like blurred print or the blank, chirring<br />
Blizzard on the t.v. set above the bar. Nothing would tell.</p>
<p>Once in a blizzard in a foreign city, having lost my way,<br />
I wondered what it would be like to be one of those—blind<br />
Drunk, high, or homeless—who would have<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no alternative except</p>
<p>To freeze to death, &amp; thought how, after the initiation of pain,<br />
They say it is like being lulled to sleep, the way the snow</p>
<p>Appears to faint as it swirls in the locked doorways of shops,<br />
The way this would be the last thing that appeared to you</p>
<p>There, before whatever was left of you became gradually<br />
Confused with a small part of the upsway</p>
<p>Of snow &amp; wind.</p>
<p>It is all a matter of confusing yourself with something else:</p>
<p>The soul curls up in a doorway, &amp; lets the snow swirl around it.</p>
<p>And…not just money then, but…<em>poverty</em>, I thought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  in the widest</p>
<p>Possible…<em>sense</em> of the term, would</p>
<p>Be…But then I knew what it would be.</p>
<p>For a moment I could hear the cats howling in their steel cages,<br />
Their thin spines turning in circles.</p>
<p>Tattoo on a forearm &amp; shriek of the wind, &amp; no figure drawn<br />
In the night&#8217;s silent contemplation by which</p>
<p>The poor might be forgotten;</p>
<p>And not you beside me in the dark but only a dry fern &amp; a Bible<br />
In the room, the rain beginning its long descent onto the roof—</p>
<p>Its sound the chirring of crickets in a ravine.</p>
<p>I could almost hear…No, I could only imagine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  hearing it. And that</p>
<p>Is what it has become:</p>
<p>Having to imagine, having to imagine everything,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In detail, and without end.<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it is an abnegation of critical responsibility to quote a passage as long as this. But the poem’s ending resists excerption, and perhaps even analysis. Suffice to say that all of the poem’s wildly disparate motifs return, and with an even greater degree of rhetorical and associative intensity. Ultimately, the vision of the poem’s closing is not so much one of apocalypse as of damnation. (References to Dante abound in Levis’s later poetry: note the allusion to Canto I of <em>The Inferno </em>in “Once in a foreign city in a blizzard, I lost my way….”) Here is The Fire Next Time as prophesized in the King James. And the vision of the afterlife conveyed in the final lines, of eternity as a state of endlessly stillborn creation, both astonishes and horrifies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Poem Ending with a Hotel on Fire” was written at the same time as the poems which comprise Levis’ great posthumous collection, <em>Elegy,</em> which was edited by Philip Levine and published the year after Levis’ death in 1996. The book was unfinished. When Levine assembled the manuscript, he made the decision that the only poems from Levis’ final years that would be included in the volume were ones which the poet had published or sent to journals. Levine regarded all the others as unfinished, and therefore not candidates for inclusion. Yet my colleague Greg Donovan, who was among those who discovered Levis’ body—he’d suffered a heart attack, his body found beside his writing table; he’d died while at work on a poem—made a careful examination of the tote bag where, in three of those black spring binders from Elbe Cisco, Levis kept typed manuscripts of poems presumably destined for his book. Greg feels that “Elegy Ending with a Hotel on Fire” was intended to be the new collection’s closing poem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would not be surprised if this were the case. All of the key stylistic and formal gestures of the later Levis are confidently on display. There’s the long undulating line with its couplets and tercets and Levis’ suave fourteeners. And of course there’s the searing chiliastic grandeur of the closing. It seems less a poem about finality as it does a writer’s <em>final </em>statement, a work in the tradition of Villon’s “Great Testament” and o Tichborne’s terrifying self-elegy, composed in the Tower of London on the eve of his execution. Here’s something left among Levis’ papers, written on the back of an envelope:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think I might build eternity into a poem, one brick, one brush of the pen at a time, an argument against one contradiction or the next, until it stares out, like the sphinx, past everyone but me. After all, I wrote it. I’m 47. My mind, my thought, has never felt so passionate, so shapely or as free of ideologies. Poetry underwrites consideration for all else. I am what made me. <em>I am not 4</em></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Levis was 49 at the time of his death, and we should assume that this passion and freedom from the merely ideological remained with him until he began to set down that final poem he was at work on at the moment of his death.  Clive James, reminding us that the terror and totalitarianism of the past century all derives from ideological fervor, defines ideology as “premature synthesis”—Levis would have agreed with this.  But other things, including, sadly, much about his writing process, will not be ours to discover. Earlier this fall I found myself in Virginia Commonwealth University Library’s special collection room, rummaging through Levis’ recently donated papers to find drafts for “Poem Ending With a Hotel on Fire.” A few months before that, Larry’s friend Mary Flinn&#8211;who had kept his papers in storage for some dozen years&#8211;his son Nicholas, his sister Sheila Brady and I stood with head librarian John Ulmschneider to survey the papers; they took up fifteen boxes. One held a pair of cowboy boots and a leather jacket, which Nick took from the box and tried on. I knew Larry Levis only very slightly; I was privy to this event because I now hold the job he once had. But there was something both majestic and bittersweet about the moment. Now Larry’s literary remains would be available to scholars in the way that we hope an important writer’s work should always be. But what comprises <em>any</em> life—at least when it’s stuffed into a set of cardboard boxes on a couple of tables&#8211;seems bewildering and paltry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bewildering: on that fall day I looked through five boxes of <em>Elegy</em>-era material my bewilderment only intensified. The Levis holdings have yet to be “processed’ by the library, so they remain only very loosely organized. Tucked among drafts of poems were things like checkbook deposit slips, poems by Larry’s students, his annual report to the department chair, copies of letters to Phil Levine, that astonishing self-appraisal scribbled on the back of the envelope, and sheet after sheet of yellow legal paper, on which poems seem to have been started. Levis’ handwriting was bold and assertive, but just as illegible as Hopkins’. And nowhere could I find anything that seemed to be an first or early draft of “Hotel on Fire…” Because the holdings had yet to be processed and a former student of mine was manning the special collections desk, I was given privileges that no other special collections library would permit you. No pencil-only-on-a legal pad for my notes; in fact, I had with me my black notebook and my Le Pen, jotting down in it whatever seemed important—titles of uncollected poems,  passages on the legal pads that later made their way into published poems. But there was nothing at all that seemed to suggest the genesis of “Hotel on Fire…” Yes, there were several typescript drafts of the poem, but most had only a few words changed. I then performed another special collection no-no and called Greg Donovan on my cell, wanting to know if he’d seen any early drafts of the poem. The problem, said Greg, was one that the survivors of most of you who are reading this would encounter if you were suddenly struck dead. While at home, Greg said, Levis did his writing on legal pads. But he had no home computer; the poems were all revised on the computer in his office. And like so many of us, Levis apparently kept files of individual poems, but no drafts of them—within the files, the poems seem to have been obsessively revised but with each new version an older version disappeared. Greg recalled that some of those files were copied onto disks, but couldn’t recall what happened to the actual computer, which was likely carted away by Technological Services when Levis’ office was reassigned, We know from some of the other Levis holdings that the poet would often do some serious mix and matching when he composed, cannibalizing a passages from a draft of one or more poems to later use in another, but whatever of this was done in “Hotel on Fire…” it seems we may never know. That this is a great loss there can be no doubt. We have the product: and in the case of “Poem Ending with a Hotel on Fire,” that product is one of the most notable poems of one of the best contemporary poets. But have only inklings of how it got to be that way. And, as writers, perhaps even more so than scholars, something in us wants evidence of the process as well as the product. And sometimes the way a writer changes a single word in a poem’s successive drafts brings us to all manner of intriguing speculation. For example, we know from the unabridged version of Curtis Bradford’s magisterial study of Yeats’ poetry manuscripts, <em>Yeats At Work, </em>that the poet struggled for a long while with the ending of his late poem “News from the Delphic Oracle,” perhaps the most extreme example of how the randy side of Yeats&#8211;which grew so prominent after his monkey gland operation, though it was doubtless only the placebo effect that accomplished this&#8211;commingled with the mythic and occultist side of his writing.  Yeats was Levis’ favorite poet, and  a passage as wild as this would surely have appealed to him:</p>
<blockquote><p>Down the mountain walls From where Pan’s cavern is<br />
Intolerable music falls.<br />
Foul goat head, brutal arm appear.<br />
Belly, shoulder, bum,<br />
Flash fishlike; nymphs and satyrs<br />
Copulate in the foam.<a href="#5"><sup>5</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Yeats’ toyed for a long while with using the f-word in place of “copulate,” a pretty radical decision for the 1930s, and if he’d done so the poem would surely be better known than it is. But <em>fuck</em> would have fucked things up. The alliteration would have been over-the-top, and effect would be comic thanks to the strong accents on <em>fuck </em> and <em>foam.</em> “Copulate in the foam” just sounds better, despite the Latinate Big Word, and the presence of four unstressed syllables in a row. Only Yeats could find a way to make a line with three times as many unstressed syllables as stressed ones sound engaging. This is an example of a little thing that is really a big thing: it invites into Yeats’ writing practice, to the attention to minutiae that most poets find fascinating, for it’s always the minutiae that counts the most in revision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As with revision, so with poets’ notebooks. As we see the minutiae accumulate, we see the evidence of mental agility, of junk and bric a brac—a conversation overheard, a lyric from <em>The Basement Tapes; </em>of Ur-poetry&#8211;an image set down to make use of later, a line from Unamuno you can’t wait to steal; of something you recall your parents or dead wife saying decades ago, or your eight-year-old saying on the previous day. The beautiful weird fodder that has to be put down even though you know it’s unlikely to ever make it into a poem. It’s a place where it somehow seems <em>important </em>to set down that the real reason William Randolph Hearst wanted to tried to get RKO to shut down the production of <em>Citizen Kane</em> was not because the movie satirized the newspaper magnet’s career, but because Welles had somehow discovered that “Rosebud” was the pet name Hearst had bestowed on the clitoris of his mistress, the actress Marion Davis. And these are things that go in the BOUND JOURNAL, not into “Daily Journal” program that comes with Microsoft Outlook, not onto your laptop while you sip a latté at Starbuck’s. The eyes have to see what the hands have done; the hands&#8211; not the keyboard. True, Auden warned that there’s a danger inherent in handwriting your observations: he allowed that you should go to the typewriter as soon as possible, for “most people like the look of their own handwriting in the way they enjoy the smell of their own farts.” But Auden had it wrong. The notebook is where the gorgeous slag of experience can reside; the flakes of gold and uncut  diamond can as often as not glitter out from it, but they can seem even more astonishing when they are yet to be polished or carved or placed in a setting. Charles Simic very sagely remarks that “our culture’s need to pigeonhole everything is defeated” in a writer’s notebooks. “Spontaneity rules here. The writer incorporates chances and makes do with the unforeseen. The head of a poet is more like a town dump than a town library.”  This seems very true to me, and Simic further states&#8211;on somewhat more shaky ground, but I’d like to believe him&#8211;that the computer will likely not replace “the fetishism of the notebook.”<a href="#6"><sup>6</sup></a> And, ironically, a byproduct of that fetishism may be durability&#8211;as we see from the example of Larry Levis, there’s a good chance that if you write something down on paper it will have a better chance of surviving into the future than if it were set down electronically. It’s sadly appropriate, somehow, that if there are any remaining drafts of a poem as apocalyptic as “Hotel on Fire,” they exist inside an archaic form of a Mac, and lie buried in a landfill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before going on, let me clarify a couple of things. I regard poets’ notebooks as work in a hybrid genre, as often as not mixing poetry, observation, aphorism, and the elements of a commonplace book. They are not to be confused with the more systematic (and often tedious) shape of diaries. Nor are they to be confused with the sort of prose that people who say they are “journaling” tend to write. When you “journal” you are not only abusing the language by turning a perfectly good noun into a perfectly awful verb&#8211;in the way that evangelicals talk about  getting together to do some “fellowshipping,” or disgruntled Facebookers “unfriend” somebody—but you also are also apt to use the work for navel-gazing and solipsistic self-analysis.  There’s nothing wrong with such endeavors, but they tend to be unliterary, inward looking rather than outward looking in the way a decent poet’s notebook has to be.  The journals I kept in my teens and twenties possessed an almost toxic level of such solipsism. As the years went on, however, my writing in the bound books changed quite a bit—less woe-is-me, and more observations, first drafts of poems, more less-than-brilliant aphorisms, more quotations from other writers, and in fact the quotations from other writers have over the years taken up the majority of space—as rightly they probably should.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem, however, with poets’ notebooks is not so much what we do with our individual efforts in the genre, but that the published examples of these documents have always been a frustrating mixture of the spectacular and the prosaic,  of lucidity and flatulence. What poets leave behind in their notebooks can show us a writer who is better at jotting there than he or she is as a poet. David Ignatow is a fine and uncompromising—though severely limited—poet of economic and class struggle. Yet the way his poetry addresses his key themes seems tepid when compared to the dogged ferocity of his published notebooks. Frost is among our great poets, but the portrait of the writer that we draw from his recently published notebooks is very much like the one that is rendered in Lawrence Thompson’s still controversial semi-authorized biography—bitter, vainglorious, deeply engaged by the world’s minutiae but all for the purpose of a sort of grim social Darwinism. Writers we deeply admire can seem lessened thanks to their notebooks, while writers we dislike can grow enormously in stature. Rene Char is much esteemed in his native France, regarded as perhaps the most ambitious and the most intellectually rigorous writer to emerge from the surrealist movement. Yet Char in his poetry has always seemed to me a cold fish. Not so the Char of <em>Leaves of Hypnos</em>, the poetic diary he kept during his years as a fighter in the French resistance,  a book that seems to me one of the most bracing meditations ever set down on the relationship between aesthetics and social engagement. (Hypnos was the Roman god of sleep, and also Char’s code name among the Maquis …) Consider the bedazzling associative affectedness of the following entry:</p>
<blockquote><p>Stars of the month of May….</p>
<p>Whenever I lift my eyes to the sky, nausea drops my jaw. I no longer hear, rising from the coolness of my eyes, <em>the moan of pleasure,</em> murmur of the woman ajar. An ash of prehistoric cacti makes my desert fly into pieces! I’m no longer <em>capable</em> of dying…</p>
<p>Cyclone, cyclone, cyclone…. <a href="#7"><sup>7</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Now consider the enormous urgency and necessity of an entry which follows only a few pages later:</p>
<blockquote><p>Horrible day! I was witness, some hundred meters away, to the execution of B. I had only to press the trigger of my Bren gun and he could have been saved! We were on the heights overlooking Ceriste, arms enough to make the bushes creak and at least equal in number to the SS. They unaware that we were there. To the eyes around me everywhere begging for the signal to open fire I answered no with my head… The June sun slipped a polar chill into my bones</p>
<p>He fell as if he didn’t make out his executioners, and so light, it seemed to me, that the last breath of wind could have lifted from earth.</p>
<p>I didn’t give the signal because the village had to be spared at <em>any price</em>. What is a village? A village like any other. Did <em>he</em> perhaps know at that ultimate instant? <a href="#8"><sup>8</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there’s Greece’s George Seferis, whose poetry, the cachet of his Nobel Prize notwithstanding, has always struck me as an oil and water mixture of Eliotic self-importance and Mediterranean sensuality—he’s a suntanned Prufrock in a bikini brief. Yet his <em>Days of 1945-1951: A Poet’s Journal, </em>is a book I’ve gone back to many times. Written shortly after his return to Greece after his escape to London in World War II, it’s comprised of fragments of poems that are better than his finished poems, the notes for a long unfinished essay on Cavafy that is perhaps the most perceptive criticism ever written on the Alexandrian master, and general speculations on a poet’s vocation that have stayed with me for decades: “In essence, a poet has only one theme—his living body.” “Suddenly you discover that you’ll spend your entire life in disorder. It’s all that you have. You must learn to live with it.” “Why does one write poems? Why, although there are such secret things (for him who writes them) does he consider them more important than anything else in life? This vital need.”<a href="#9"><sup>9</sup></a> You get a sense that Seferis regarded <em>Days of 1945-1951 </em>not as fodder for future poems and essays, but as a distinct work in its own right, something he shares with the sadly neglected Black Mountaineer Paul Blackburn, who came to think of his poetic journals—he called them <em>The Journals</em>&#8211;as his greatest poetic legacy. This seems to me the case as well, and Blackburn was certainly a much more accomplished improviser than a first-thought-best-thought peer such as Allen Ginsberg. Here, for example is the work’s penultimate entry/section, from July 1971. Blackburn, at 45, is dying of esophageal cancer. He’s taking a flight from the East to the  West Coast, a sadly valedictory journey, it seems. Readers below a certain age will find this implausible, but in those days they let you smoke on the plane, at least for part of journey:</p>

<p>Blackburn’s prediction proved right. He survived Stachmo by a few months, but not as far as 1972.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One reason why the notebooks of Ignatow, Char, and Seferis have the impact they do is that their authors were involved in their publication and arrangement, or, like Blackburn, left fair typescripts. This is not always a good thing: the Simic comments I quote from above come from an introduction to a volume called <em>The Poet’s Note Book: Excerpts from the Notebooks of 26 American Poets. </em>The intro is far more compelling than the notebook entries themselves, although they present work by a wide range of contemporary poets&#8211;among them Marvin Bell, Rita Dove, Carolyn Forche, James Merrill, William Matthews, and Donald Justice. But it’s all rather dull, self-serving and sanitized. The book is in essence a set of cherry-picked fragments, aphorisms and pensees designed mainly to make their authors look smart rather than to reflect their minds at work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But these writers in some respects fare better than those whose posthumously published notebooks were edited by the wrong hands. Theodore Rotheke’s <em>Straw For the Fire, </em>a selection of the poet’s journals edited by his student David Wagoner, is a bizarrely Oedipal affair. Wagoner does a serviceable job of selecting Roethke’s prose—there are wonderful notebook jottings on process and teaching and some manic aphorisms that bring to mind  Blake’s <em>Proverbs of Hell. </em>But Roethke, like Larry Levis, often composed his poems by knitting together fragments that originally were set down in his notebooks. At some point in the editing of <em>Straw for the Fire, </em> Wagoner seems to have decided he could do much the same with the pieces that Roethke had left on the cutting room floor, fashioning entirely “new” poems from them, to which he’s bestowed appropriately Roethkian titles along the lines of “The Mire’s My Home,” “Father-Stem and Mother Root,” “The Things I Steal From Sleep,” and “My Flesh Learned to Die.” You wouldn’t be surprised to come across a poem with one of these titles in <em>The Lost Son</em> or <em>The Far Field.</em> But are these pieces mainly Roethke or mainly Wagoner? The whole enterprise is ghoulish, much in the way that recording companies find ways to make dead singers keep coming up with new material. You know the drill: John Lennon and Buddy Holly have their gorgeously raw home demos turned into lushly orchestrated drivel. And somehow from the grave Jimi Hendrix releases several times as many albums  than he ever released during his lifetime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At least Wagoner was, in some perverse way, attempting to be discerning. On my desk beside me is a phonebook sized monstrosity called <em>Portrait of Delmore, </em>the notebooks of Roethke’s fellow middle generation poet Delmore Schwartz, who in his day was regarded as the figure who would leave all his contemporaries in the dust—all the Lowells, Berrymans, Rukeysers, Jarrells and Bishops. The notebook entries dating from Schwartz’s early career, roughly until the late 1940s, are intriguing, but only just so. When Schwartz’s mental illness and drinking and drugging become more pronounced, the work is excruciating, the fragments of poems mostly trite, and the self-appraisals agonizing, especially as Schwartz obsessively, for almost two years, contemplates the aftermath of the failure of his marriage to the novelist Elizabeth Pollett—who some twenty years after Schwartz’s death takes it upon herself to became  the editor of the volume. Pollett’s introduction to the volume is reasonable and tender—she states that, “in editing, my main principle was <em>readability</em>, with emphasis on any underlying dramatic themes.” [xv]. Yet what are we to make of an entry such as this, from May 14, 1959?</p>
<blockquote><p>Eight Dexedrine with a lift for an hour, during which I copied pages of Rilke. Then the bleakness and the emptiness came back. I walked twice to the park, stopped, the second time, at the Riviera—Liz Cooper was there, with her young shiftless friend Bill, and Wolfe O’Meara. And by 4 I had hurried to the White Horse, where I drank five, six, seven, or eight gin-and-tonics. Jeanne Adams came in and sat next to me and leaned against me. Later Zoe Broadwin—Harvard 1947—came in and greeted me as Delmore. But Jeanne kept me from talking to him, questioning me about why I was depressed. I argued with Dick Bagley (film maker) about Joyce—I was really arguing with some feeling that he has about himself which he projects into modern literature and art. Tom Clancy (folk singer, actor) defended Joyce too, and then left me in the middle by praising O’Casey (whom I have not really read). I began to feel maudlin as Bagley left after buying me a drink and calling me “one of the major poets of the century”! And I threw up (as I had on Tuesday, in the morning), after taking two s.t.s.” (628)<a href="#11"><sup>11</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>It breaks your heart&#8211;and what could Pollet have been <em>thinking</em> to let this out into the world?  And this is certainly not the most abashed or self-lacerating of Schwartz’s journal entries. In a final notebook that he was keeping when his body was found—he’d died from a heart attack in a skid row hotel elevator&#8211;Schwartz writes, “The poisonous world flows into my mouth/like water into a drowning man’s.”<a href="#12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Yet for all the damage that can be done to a posthumous reputation thanks to publications such as these, there are also some splendid examples of poetic justice being served. The critic Ruth Limmer devoted much of her career to preserving the literary reputation of Louise Bogan, a poet whose highly polished lyric precision now seems admirable but dated; she’s much better than the other woman formalists who emerged in the 1920s&#8211;Millay and Teasdale seem lumbering and saccharine in comparison. But Limmer’s <em>Journey Around My Room</em>— which she subtitles a “mosaic” of Bogan’s notebook entries, fragments of an autobiography, and drafts of poems, some collected, some that had previously existed only in manuscript—is a volume of aching beauty, a far more complex and revealing portrait of Bogan than is evidenced in her published verse, and a foundational document of 20th Century feminism. Limmer’s strength as an editor is a gift for surprising but sensible juxtapositions; the entries, maxims, and poems are not beholden to chronology, but Limmer eschews the uncomfortable one-upmanship that so troubles us about <em>Straw for the Fire. </em>In the following entry, Bogan both belittles and aggrandizes her habit of notebook-keeping:</p>
<blockquote><p>The keeping of a journal may become a futile and time-wasting occupation for a writer. Temptation toward the inconsequential detail, the vaporous idea, and the self-regarding emotion are always present and can become overwhelming. But whatever I do, apart from the short cry (lyric poetry) and the short remark (journalism) must be in the form of notes. Mine is the talent of the cry or the <em>cahier.</em><a href="#13"><sup>13</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Yet this entry is directly followed by a passage on the nature of time and longing that has a gracefulness and psychological wisdom that rivals Proust:</p>
<blockquote><p>“My time will come,” you say to yourself, but how can you know whether your time has not already come, and gone? Perhaps one afternoon the verandah in Panama, with the Barbadians whetting their sickles on the hill below, the Chinese gardens green, the noise of the breakers beyond the hill below, the crochet in your lap, and the cool room shuttered and the sheered bed—perhaps that was your time. (But it was too early.) Or mornings in the sunny room in Boston, when the children cried loudly from the public school across the way, “A prairie is a <em>grassy</em> plain,” and you sat on the low couch with your books and papers about you, happy and safe and calm: perhaps your time was then.  (But you didn’t see it at all.) Perhaps it has been spent, all spent, in streetcars, drinking gin, smoking cigarettes—in connubial love, in thousands of books devoured by the eye, in eating, sewing, in suspicions, tears, jealousy, hatred, and fear. Perhaps it is now, on a dark day in October, in the bedroom where you sit with emptiness in your body and heart; beside the small fire, drying your hair—older, more tired, desperately silent, unhappily alone, with faith and daydreams (perhaps luckily) broken and disappearing, with the dreadful pain in your shoulder which presages dissolution, infection, and age. Perhaps this very instant is your time—pretty late—but still your own, your peculiar, your promised and presaged moment, out of all moments forever.<a href="#14"><sup>14</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Typing this, I am dumbfounded by the absolute mastery of Bogan’s prose rhythms. How can she shift so seamlessly from densely lapidary description to the most heart-rending bald directness?  The phrasing, the very punctuation, is immaculate. Yet this is also <em>improvised</em>, someone jotting in a notebook a “cry” that she has just belittled as lachrymose. Limmer has stage-managed all this, but you can’t read the two passages without bowing down before a sensibility and talent which none of us can come close to matching.  Could Bogan have done this had she access to the “daily journal” function on Outlook, or on one of those dinky laptops the size of postage stamps that are now all the rage with my students? I wonder.  Nor would this have been possible, I daresay, as a blog post on <a href="http://louboganthecrier.com/">http://louboganthecrier.com</a>. (“My time will come u say 2 urself, bt can u know whether yr time is gone…WTF?!”) But mostly I marvel at Bogan’s artistry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to close with a brief look at two recently published poets’ notebooks that seem to me of the first order, the equals of Char, Seferis, and Bogan.  One is a poet whose opinions about notebooks we already know: Charles Simic, whose <em>The Monster Loves His Labyrinth</em> is  evidence of a formidable poet writing at his full powers. I have to confess to mixed feelings about Simic’s verse; the best of it is indispensable, but much of it seems written on automatic pilot; the mystery, genius with metaphor, and baffled sense of the world as an immense oxymoron devolves in the lesser poems into mere whimsy and self-imitation. I find Simic’s prose more consistent; his  books in the Michigan Poets on Poetry series depart from the series norm of bottom-of-the drawer occasional prose and are substantial pieces of writing, both the autobiographical sketches and the essays on contemporary poetry. These latter pieces, which often appear in the <em>New York Review of Books,</em> show Simic to be perhaps our best poetry reviewer since Jarrell. And I should also mention Simic’s <em>Dime Store Alchemy</em>, a series of meditations on the boxes of Joseph Cornell that leaves most of the work on Cornell by art historians in the dust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The maxims, parables, scraps of verse, one-liners and absurdist parables of <em>The Monster Loves His Labyrinth </em>manage to combine the quizzical imagination of Simic’s poetry with the searching intelligence of his prose; the hybrid genre of the notebook is in several keys ways the ideal mode for Simic’s unique sensibility. Having been born in the former Yugoslavia on the verge of World War II, but coming of age in Chicago, Simic has always been a poet whose Eastern European irony and cultivation fuses with a deep appreciation of the American vernacular and equally deep intolerance for our various national hypocrisies. Although he dwells on the cusp between two cultures, the mixture has never seemed a strained or unnatural one. The mix is abundantly in evidence in one of the book’s first entries, which is funny and savage by turns:</p>
<blockquote><p>I didn’t tell you how I got lice wearing a German helmet. This used to be a famous story in our family. I remember those winter evenings just after the War with everyone huddled around the stove, talking and worrying late into the night. Sooner or later, it was inevitable, someone would bring up my German helmet full of lice. They thought it was the funniest thing they ever heard. Old people had tears of laughter in their eyes. A kid dumb enough to walk around with a German helmet full of lice. They were crawling all over it. Any fool could see them!</p>
<p>I sat there saying nothing, pretending to be equally amused,  nodding my head while thinking to myself,  what a bunch of idiots! All of them. They had no idea how I got the helmet, and I wasn’t about to tell them,  It was one of those first days just after the liberation of Belgrade, I was in the old cemetery with a few friends, just kind of snooping around. A couple of German solders, obviously dead, lay stretched on the ground. We drew closer for a better look. They had no weapons. Their boots were gone, but there was a helmet that had fallen to the side of one of them. I don’t know what the others got, but I went for the helmet. I tiptoed so as not to wake the dead man.  I also kept my eyes averted. I never saw his face, even if I sometimes think I did.  Everything else about that moment is still intensely clear to me.</p>
<p>That’s the story of the helmet full of lice.<a href="#15"><sup>15</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole passage dwells within various liminal places:  are these the rhythms of prose or of poetry? They’re flawless either way. The prose is transcultural,  veering from a language distinctly East European&#8211;the second paragraph has the parable-like phrasing of Isaac Bashevis Singer—to the pure Huck Finn Americana we get when the child Simic purloins the helmet:  “I was in the old cemetery with a few friends, just snooping around.”  And of course this is funny as hell and tragic: what is a dead man? The source of a trophy, a souvenir, a toy. But the dead man also retains some powerful mojo: don’t look him in the face, whatever you do, and if you desecrate his resting place, a kind of King Tut’s Curse will follow. Imagine little Charles, triumphantly affixing the Wehrmacht helmet to his head: it’s way too big; it slides down toward his chin, even as he tightens the strap. And how hungry those lice must have been, having sucked every drop of the blood of the dead private’s scalp some days ago.  Yet this riotous mixture ends on a different and unexpected note, asking some of the most vexing questions about the nature of memory itself: “I never saw his face, even if sometimes I think I did. Everything else about that moment is intensely clear to me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much of the book’s first section dwells upon Simic’s similarly grostesque episodes from his Serbian childhood and his immigrant’s consternation at American culture, especially as seen from the vantage point of what seems an endless series of shitty menial jobs, jobs that offer opportunities for Grand Guignol theatrics every bit as unhinging as the helmet story. Yet Simic always mixes his absurdities with tenderness. Near the end of the section, he offers this entry:</p>
<blockquote><p>The face of my daughter lit by a table lamp while she sucks a finger pricked by a compass. A drop of blood already fallen on the black letters and numerals of the difficult homework, as she worries to hand it in, just as it is, to the stern old nun who’ll make her stand in front of the class waiting for the verdict…The spring day bright with sunlight. The nun’s small dark fist clouding the answer.<a href="#16"><sup>16</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The Monster Loves His Labyrinth</em> is divided by Simic into five sections, one largely autobiographical, another devoted (mainly) to thoughts on the art of poetry and literary reputation, another primarily aphoristic (showcasing the writer’s signature gallows humor) and a final section concerned primarily with aging.  <em> </em>The volume, like a good book of poems, takes pains to see that these thematic categories aren’t too rigid, as the placement of the passage above attests. (And, for what it’s worth, there’s an hilarious passage in the book about Simic showing his early poems to Louise Bogan….) Good writers’ notebooks are partly a display of literary chops, partly a glimpse into the author’s mind and writing process, partly a form of wisdom literature. Simic’s <em>Monster</em> is all of these. Reading it is a great delight, enough so that it makes me want to read all of Simic—both the poetry and the prose—another time, this time equipped with  a more discerning sense of what his mission really is.</p>
<p><em>Monster </em>was published within a few months of Stephen Cope’s edition of George Oppen’s  <em>Selected Prose, Daybooks, and Papers.</em> You couldn’t encounter two writers who are more different. Simic is composed of irony, contradiction, guffaws, and sudden flashes of pathos. Oppen is, with the possible exception of Eliot—at least in the work he allowed to be published and not the King Bolo and suchlike material; not the un-Eliotic <em>Triumph of Bullshit</em>—the most humorless of America’s great poets. But <em>great</em> Oppen surely is, and if you have any doubts about Oppen’s importance the Daybooks will convert you. And, what’s more, <em>The Daybooks </em>are physically, formally, and temperamentally unique documents, completely so. Although he is usually lumped with the Objectivist School of poets, and maintained long literary friendships with Louis Zukofsky and Charles Reiznikoff, Cope rightly characterizes Oppen as the essential American “iconoclast,” not a member of a school but a party of one. He may share with the other Objecitivsts an obsession for clarity of expression and a fastidiously laconic method;  he also shared their social consciousness, but whereas the leftism of Zukofsky seems merely literary, Oppen was the genuine article.  As a labor organizer and a Communist Party member, Oppen paid a price for his social activism, and his writing paid a price for it too. Not long after publishing his first collection in 1934, Oppen voluntarily undertook a poetic silence that lasted almost twenty-five years, feeling that the writing was at odds with his political organizing. He fought in the infantry in World War II, and when his political affinities imperiled him during the McCarthy era, he spent a good many years in a kind of semi-voluntary exile in Mexico. Oppen’s return to writing poetry coincided with his return to the United States in 1958 and a shift from doctrinaire Marxism to an unaffiliated leftism. In the ‘60s he enjoyed his most productive period, publishing three collections, among them the Pulitzer-prizewinning <em>Of Being Numerous </em>in 1968, one of the key long poems of our time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oppen began keeping his <em>Daybooks</em> around the time of his return to the States, and though they are undated, his five extant daybooks seem to have occupied him for some fifteen years, until shortly before the onset of the Alzheimer’s that eventually silenced him. The daybooks are typed but contain extensive handwritten notes and corrections—they seem to have begun in improvisation but kept evolving—not with an eye toward publication, but toward a quintessentially Oppen-ish clarity. It’s possible that Oppen worked on more than one of the daybooks at the same time. As the facsimiles of some of the manuscript pages included in Cope’s edition attest, the daybooks were odd-looking affairs, “makeshift books bound by Oppen using various ready-to-hand materials (pipe stem cleaners, nails and wood, paste, glue.”  17 They sometimes contain passages and phrases which also appear in Oppen’s published poetry, but in key respects they are an entity of their own, the place where this most thoughtful of poets kept honing his thoughts, and consequently Cope has developed a highly elaborate—but still quite readable—system for replicating passages of Oppen’s strike-outs and handwritten revisions, for passages he later underscores or sets off for special emphasis, etc. We get, in other words, the down and dirty of intellectual endeavor as it morphs to lyric endeavor, sometimes in statements and pensees, sometimes in passages of verse, sometimes in combinations of the two. What is Oppen’s general goal in the project? Again and again, it seems to be the fundamental problem of getting at truth through the means of the general unshapely-ness and untrustworthiness of words. Most of  us think about this problem, but unlike so many of his modernist predecessors, Oppen was skeptical of any synthesizing system of aesthetic principles; this famously modest writer saw such systems less as philosophies than as displays of hubris. At one point in the daybooks, for example,  he suggests we can do without Wallace Stevens and his supreme fictions. For Oppen, the struggle is more fraught than that, as this passage so well illustrates:</p>
<blockquote><p>The poem: correcting, one hears a word or a line as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">wrong,</span> as against some idea of the good, the perfect—Correcting word by word, line by line, toward a concept which you hold and never experience?</p>
<p>The music of the poem does seem to be “out there,” extant—<br />
the sound toward which you are working<br />
But why in the mind? Where most clearly it is</p>
<p>Newton: the moment of excitement was the grasp of necessary truth. And the thought: I AM SAYING WORDS TO MYSELF BUT THOSE WORDS MUST REPRESENT THE TRUTH OF THINGS OUT THERE WHERE I HAVE NEVER BEEN AND CAN NEVER BE</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That words must be true, the syntax must work!  And words, something one has learned as an infant, something the nurse used&#8211;! They can be constructed like number into <em>necessary truth!</em></p>
<p>Of the transcendental truth some things come—well, floating down in fragments like leaves of a tree&#8211;.As, numbers, which seem to act on necessary truth. <em>Do words? Do we lack a transfixitive syntax?<a href="#18"><sup>18</sup></a></em></p></blockquote>
<p>It’s the same relentlessly earnest and deeply sober depth of speculation that readers familiar with Oppen’s poetry know so well. But whereas the poems seem chiseled by their ideas, the daybooks seem to genuinely <em>worry</em> over them. More than many of his generational peers, Oppen was highly read in 20<sup>th</sup> Century European philosophy, especially Heidegger and Wittgenstein. Like Wittgenstein, Oppen’s preferred stance is skepticism, and his preferred mode is minimalist. But the searching and quizzical tone of the daybooks is far different from Wittgenstein’s maddeningly lapidary aloofness. And even at his most philosophical, Oppen, unlike the apolitical Wittgenstein, insists that the problems of philosophy and writing are also problems involving the need for social justice:</p>
<p>My “symbols”—I do not quite agree that they are symbols. The man who holds in his mind some rare thing—a crocus, an owl—and uses it to state a meaning has indeed found himself a symbol. But I speak of the things I see, and that I see everyday, because my life is lead among them, because I have no life free from them, and must obviously find meaning in them, if I am to find meaning. <em>at all.</em><a href="#19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>This brings to mind the stunning 27<sup>th</sup> section of <em>Of Being Numerous. </em></p>
<blockquote><p>It is difficult now to speak of poetry—</p>
<p>About those who have recognized the range of choice or those who have lived the life they were born to&#8211;.It is not precisely a question of profundity but of a different order of experience. One would have to tell what happens in a life, what choices present themselves, what the world is for us, what happens in time, what thought is in the course of a life, and therefore what art is, and the isolation of the actual.</p>
<p>I would want to talk of rooms and of what they look out on and of basements, the rough walls bearing the marks of the forms, the old marks of wood in the concrete, such solitude as we know—</p>
<p>And the swept floors. Someone, a workman bearing about him, feeling about him that particular wordlike a dishonored fatherhood he has swept away this solitary floor, this profoundly hidden floor—such solitude as we know.</p>
<p>One must not come to feel that he has a thousand threads in his hands.<br />
He must somehow seem the one thing;<br />
This is the level of art.<br />
There are other levels<br />
But there is no other level of art.<a href="#20"><sup>20</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oppen’s <em> Daybooks</em> start in such strata, in their acceptance of the fact that we build our writing lives out of an essential unknowing. Yet we are blessed to also begin this process upon some foundation that may be ancient and neglected, but which is also ultimately sound and communal: the level of art. That place underground may not be the landfill or the town dump, after all; it may instead be the buried palace walls, the flattened ramparts of an ancient city, the Mycenae where Schliemann, slogging in the mud, suddenly lifts up the hammered golden mask of Agamemnon. The place where it all has ended so that it all may start again. Our notebooks, I would submit, are the closest material things we have that replicate such places, where we get on our knees and dig into the mud with our hands, where we sweep away the “solitary hidden floor,” where Hypnos stays up long into the night, cleaning his weapon by oil-lamp, then filling another leaf of his album; where  Louise Bogan tells us she knows why the Ninth Circle of Hell is icy because she “has laid her living hand upon it”; where a certain Monster within a certain Labyrinth marvels at the fact that he doesn’t believe in God but is still “afraid of opening an umbrella in the house” ; and where, to our eternal good fortunate, a serious young man&#8211;who does believe in God&#8211;keeps trying to hypnotize a duck.</p>

<p>If I’m not a bear, thought the bear&#8211;<br />
and wistfulness rose in him, <em>maybe<br />
he was a falcon, a redwood, a slug,<br />
a raccoon</em>&#8211;but then his bear brain<br />
made him look down at his chest and belly,<br />
and what he saw&#8211;his furry paunch,<br />
the queer white of his skin, a tick<br />
so full of bear blood it would soon<br />
drop off&#8211;was like a boulder blocking<br />
the path of his thinking.<span>  </span><em>A soft<br />
little spring breeze, he thought, why<br />
couldn’t I be the high meadow full<br />
of quarrelsome bobolinks who nip<br />
the little yellow moths from the air<br />
when they’re hungry?<span>  </span>Why couldn’t I…?</em><br />
but suddenly such mental bearfoolery<br />
sickened him into standing humanlike<br />
to bam his ribcage with his front legs,<br />
and to angrily stomp (though he hated<br />
when he split infinitives) Lady Fern,<br />
Guelder Rose, and Carpet Moss until<br />
he’d dampened his lower paws with black-<br />
green juice, conjured a rich forest dirt<br />
and vegetable stink to waft upward.<span>  </span>Oh,<br />
that was when the bear got it straight,<br />
not just the news of his irrevocable<br />
bearness and the piss-ant misery<br />
of a bear’s lot but also on the other<br />
hand the luck of his snout, his tongue,<br />
his penis and balls, his improbable speed,<br />
his forever hidden-from-himself asshole,<br />
his being no other creature or thing<br />
than the bear that he was, an aging<br />
and otherwise unremarkable eastern<br />
black bear.<span>  </span>He was never to be a brown<br />
trout married to icy water and speckled<br />
slithering among stones, nor could he be<br />
the red-tailed hawk whose killing ways<br />
were, to the bear in his picture of it<br />
right then&#8211;death falling from the sky&#8211;<br />
so merciless, clean, and righteous.</p>

to deactivate the dead, but “He leaves his wife<br />
of fifty years, Constance,” as if the journey<br />
were his to determine, and compared with this life<br />

but there may be a setting forth, a way with key<br />
in hand to unlock some admittedly unknown<br />
door or portal. In other words, maybe he’s busy,<br />
careless of the cherished days left behind (below?)<br />
and in such a departure neither bed-ridden nor dizzy<br />
nor undignified, he leaves a little of his leaving<br />
so that it’s hers, too, making the event hardly<br />
more than errand, if indeed his faculties were sturdy:<br />
“leaves,” she almost believes, will carry off her grieving.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Drake lived in our shed for a month during the summer. At least that’s what we called it. The shed, our shack, a hut held up by the air itself. Not that it matters much out here, where everything seems made from sun and sand. Colton, Iowa isn’t just where two counties cross paths; it’s also where one drought seems to turn into another, doubling up the heat. An unincorporated community of thirty-nine on the border between the towns of Dexter and Gooding, it was once the solitary way station on a road to nowhere, but since the Interstate arrived it’s now just a place separated by a quiet two-lane highway, a gas station, and a pile of double-wides feeding off lost travelers. In other words, it’s no place for a pretty girl to be raised, which is why for class photos my mother used to dress me so you couldn’t tell me apart from other short-haired schoolboys: overalls covering every inch of skin, long-toed sneakers enveloping my feet like second-hand clown shoes. But this year, as sixteen rolled around, there was no hiding anymore. With the lanky legs and generous chest, I became a reluctant member of the girl race, forever and ever, amen.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>In fact, before she died this summer, I’d catch Mom gazing at me, eyes slit and shaking her head, almost as if blaming my body—healthy and spreading—for the cancer eating her from the inside out. In the past, she wouldn’t want me around much anyway, which felt like a blessing of sorts, especially when she came back from the bar with men searching for a bed. Regardless of the reports every few years about missing girls, women foolishly following strangers into the fields, these men still wound up in our trailer. But when the lumps were detected last year, and the men began to look me up and down instead, Mom would offer the car keys and tell me to drive somewhere else. Still some nights I’d accidentally walk in on them. And despite the first impulse to run, I couldn’t help stare. She was beautiful back then. Thick legs straddling a waist, her hands touching her own curves, eyes shut as if she were alone. I’d silently back out of the room, nobody ever even knowing I was there, and listen to the various boys make their noises down the hall throughout the nights, only to leave the next morning like a quick mist.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I almost miss her in those moments—the way she moved like water while making love—as opposed to the way many will remember her right before she passed. The way her blouses suddenly sat flat against her, the way she rubbed vitamin E into the scars, and the way it didn’t even matter when six months later everything had already settled into her bones. And it’s hard not to blame Colton itself—so far away from any kind of help—for her running out of options and time. But the last few months, when her boyfriends came by she still made me trace her lips in red and slather on the bright-blue eye shadow. I dressed her in the leopard-print blouses, as well as the flame-red pants that once sucked in her skin and now hung loose on her hips. Then she’d send me away again. But it’s when my Dad finally arrived back on the scene that she demanded I stick around, treat him nice, as if we were finally a family once more.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>When Dad pulled up on a cloud of motorcycle fumes, I figured he was just another lover come to pay their respects. But then I saw his freshly shaved face and knew he was different. He looked like a rock star, a cowboy, something from TV. Nothing like other bikers who stopped for gas and beer on their way to the desert. This guy walked at a faster clip. He didn’t smell like 30-weight oil. And he seemed sober when strolling through our gate.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in">“This Susan’s place?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I led him inside and pointed to her room. He nodded and said I was just as pretty as ever. Mom slept most of the time, the fatigue often overtaking her so suddenly you could spend moments talking to yourself before realizing her eyes were shut. So it wasn’t long until he was out on the porch again, asking me if I recalled his face.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I shook my head. “She’s only got a few days left. I’d save it for her.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Pretty tough, huh?” His shaggy blond hair fluttered like ribbon in the wind.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Maybe. Maybe not.” I dug at the grit under my toenails. The streetlights were coming on and the neon signs around town slowly came into focus: <em>Beer. Gas. Vacancy.</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">He sat down next to me, his leathers creaking like a worn-out chair, and put his arm around my shoulders. But his hand didn’t wander like most of the guys who visited. He smelled like sweat and spearmint gum, saying, “Yeah, you look tough enough. Just like your mama.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>When Drake first came through our trailer court, dreads hanging like a bead curtain down his back and looking lost, I quickly saw a strange echo of myself. A face full of lonesomeness as he lingered up and down the lane, one moment leaning against a light pole then gone entirely. At first he just watched from afar like I was a model demonstrating how it all works. This is how we eat cereal on the porch. This is when you’re supposed to go to bed and how to avoid it. This is how we dress while working at the gas station: <em>Hello, My Name is Hannah</em>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Then one morning, he at last appeared on our stoop, the sun already electric.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“What’s your name?” I asked, sneaking up behind as if he were a feral stray.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>He didn’t flinch, didn’t even turn around. “If you want me to leave, ask nice.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Did I say that?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">His black braids were like little anchors holding his head in place. When he stood, I saw a face not much older than mine, eyes like ice chips. He held out a hand. “What’s <em>your</em> name?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“I asked first.” I put my hand inside his but didn’t shake. Our clasp hung there between us like a prayer gone unanswered. We were two bronzed statues, my skin naturally tanned from living in this endless oven of a town, but his was different. Almost like chocolate but sunnier than that, as if a light emanated from within his body, turning his dark skin bright.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%;">“I thought only black people had hair like that.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>His hand never let go of mine. He nodded, staring down at my chest. “You’re beautiful.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>I squinted back, a common kind of expression around here. “You’re weird.” I pulled back my hand. He didn’t try to hold on. “Don’t you have somewhere else to be?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“I don’t know,” he said. “Seems like a good place to be.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“You kidding? It’s like 100 degrees out here. And it’s not through yet.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>His crooked teeth tumbled through the smile. They looked like a bunch of sharp rocks falling in front of one another. “It’s perfect. Don’t you think?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>I didn’t though. I had absolutely no idea what to think.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>After the funeral, Dad stuck around. My mother’s last request. It wasn’t a scary offer. In fact, it was a comfort of sorts. His face wasn’t hungry. There was no anger in his bones. He even kept his eyes to himself. Actually, he looked so soft and sweet it felt like having a pet.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%;">And as soon as she was buried, Dad said it was time to get rid of the clutter. “Past is nothing but a road block,” he said, throwing Mom’s skirts and stilettos in a garbage bag.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Maybe I wanted those,” I said, knowing that wasn’t true.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“People offer good money for these things.” I wasn’t sure which people he was referring to, but it was nice to have an adult around for once, taking care any way he saw fit. He put on rubber gloves to touch her sheets, the empty vials of hydrocodone, the half-filled water glasses that could never fully quench her thirst. I told him cancer wasn’t contagious, but he kept right on holding his breath until the trash sack was out of sight on the other side of our fence.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">That night he left. I figured he was gone for good—another part-time parent. Then two days later he walked back into the trailer and opened a beer. I didn’t ask where he’d been, knowing silence was the best way to keep talking to one another. But he must have seen the question in my face when he winked at me. “I was trying to find you a new mom.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I laughed. “They were never in large supply around here.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Dad touched my hand, offered me his beer. I waved it away and witnessed the lost look on his face. But he just didn’t get it. One mother had been enough. Another just felt like replacement parts.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Since summers were dangerous, Dad traded a couple of things for a plastic pool we sat in most afternoons, spraying ourselves with the withered garden hose when the sweat was too much. I soaked in a bikini while Dad dipped his feet in the water, dozing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Drake usually watched from across the street until one day we saw him drag a couch down our lane, cutting a small path in the gravel. He couldn’t get the sofa through our gate. We watched him struggle to lift it over the chain-link. When that didn’t work, he left it in the road and took a seat on our porch wearing dirty khakis, his hiking boots all but torn in two.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Too big,” he said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Dad sprayed his knees and said, “If you want a day job, stealing isn’t it.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I didn’t steal it.” Drake licked his lips and grinned. “It was just laying there.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Dad nodded. “You definitely have a criminal’s mind.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The couch had been out for so long nobody would even know it was missing. One thing we weren’t short on was spare furniture acting as lawn ornaments. But nobody paid much mind out here, our town never more than a pit stop, a quick blur from one end to the other. So I helped Drake lift the couch on the porch. None of the springs were broken yet. Perfect for sunset-sitting. That night Drake and I watched the purple overcome the sky when he finally asked about Mom.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“She’s not around anymore.” I crossed my arms under the shelf of my breasts, pushing them together. It was hard to know exactly what to do with them sometimes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Mine neither,” he said. “My dad went back below the border. Said he’d bring my uncle and they’d start an auto shop. That was a month ago.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“About the time my mom took off as well.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“You’re lucky to still have <em>him</em> around.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I wasn’t so sure. Dad sealed a leak in our roof, though no rain had fallen for months. He raked our gravel. He even put up a basketball hoop at the dead end of our street for all the trailer kids. It simply stood there, alone and idle like a lightning rod, a spare spine that nobody needed hanging around.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“He’s pretty new to all this,” I said. “We’re more like roommates.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span> </span>“I’d take a roommate.” The tone in his voice was all but begging to stay, even if just for a bit. But I wouldn’t ask that of him. I liked him too much already, and he’d be better off moving to another town where waiting around wasn’t your only option.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%;">Drake didn’t show for a few days and I figured he’d caught my drift. At first it was hard, cutting our ties. For a place where goodbyes were a way of life, I couldn’t shake the sadness—a misbegotten boy, put upon and left behind. But when he reappeared a few days later dragging a large rug down the lane, I knew he wasn’t going anywhere.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span> </span>Dad was impressed. “Resourceful little thing, isn’t he?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I splashed water on my legs that sprouted wiry dark hairs even though I was bleach-blond up top. Dad helped pull the rug over the fence. It smelled bad and looked stained. That’s when he offered Drake the shed. “Not much but a place to keep out of the sun.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Drake scratched his elbow, dry and ashy. “My dad will be looking for me.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Sure, sure. Just in the meantime. With a gift like yours, it’s best to stay under cover.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Drake said he didn’t pickpocket, didn’t shoplift. <em>He was a good kid,</em> he kept telling us.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span><span> </span>“You <em>are</em> a good kid,” Dad agreed. “With brown skin.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Drake looked at the couch he’d offered in exchange for some company. And now here he was being handed a new home, even if it was out back in a shack. “What’s the catch?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Dad came up behind me and laid his hands on my shoulders. His grip was cold, as if those fingers were made from some strange element, a small frost foreign around these parts.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“What you think, Hannah? Isn’t it about time you had a brother around here?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>I didn’t say yes or no. I couldn’t even shrug under his touch. I just stared at Drake, my dark-skinned twin, and knew our little family had just gotten one boy bigger.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;" align="center">***</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Mom never said a word about Dad. All my life I heard about how no father gone missing was worth the time it took to speak his name. And his absence was larger than any one body could ever fill. Probably why there were so many men around with their gleaming bikes and rusty beards, guys with watery tattoos smearing their skin, playing tough-guy. At the gas station, I’d see them come and go as if through a turnstile. Each the same as the rest: hard shelled and licking their chops as I moved from one pump to the next. It was also probably why I was still a virgin. Whenever I took a man’s money and his winks, they all had bottomless eyes that could break your heart real easy if you let them.<span>  </span>But my mom, on the other hand, couldn’t stop herself.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">For only being forty, my mother appeared twenty years older. I’d seen pictures of her when she was in school, looking more like myself than I’d like to admit. But I still remember in junior high when I felt the first trickle run down my leg. I thought I’d peed my pants until I saw all that red coming out of me. I ran to the nurse, thinking I was dying, until she told me about becoming a woman. That it was a proud moment. That it was part of our burden and blessing. Except when I told my mother, she simply rolled her eyes and sighed and said she didn’t need another woman around stealing her show. She tried to smile, like it was a joke, but a year later when the men began to watch me as I walked out of a room, I knew it wasn’t a funny at all.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">But despite the wear and tear, before long Mom would have everyone staring at her simply by smiling. Men paid her tabs in exchange for a little attention. She wasn’t just a mother to me but to every man who set sight on her, took her in their arms. I had all the big brothers I could handle, each one of them gone by the break of sun, heading off into that barren fields where all the rest of the bodies are buried. And though she’s gone I still feel her close by, as if wandering the wilderness, but still it’s hard to remember much. At one point she was full of life and the next she’d simply let the cancer take over like a permanent passerby. Sometimes when I try to think back, it feels as if she’d never really been there. Like some kind of mirage that only hungry, half-dying men could see from afar but up close quickly vanished. At hand she was nowhere to be found but from a distance across the room she looked good enough to drink.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The first day of July, the thermometer ready to pop, another film crew rolled through. They always chose the worst time of year, our town teeming with heat waves and government warnings. At the station, as they filled their tanks, Drake slipped behind the counter with me as if leery of strangers. Most days he’d stay behind with Dad. When I was around, they spent most of their time trading war stories about the road, though none of their tales added up to much or gave any kind of hint about where they’d actually been. By the time I got home, they’d usually gone to bed, probably tired from talking themselves in circles. But today Drake tagged along, looking pale and full of the fidgets. I figured the heat was finally getting to him.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%;">A guy wearing a Hawaiian shirt came in and took out a credit card. I gave it a swipe, and as the machine added up its numbers and sent them up to the satellites I studied the vans outside.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Hollywood wasn’t an uncommon sight. Iowa gave tax relief for them to come and make our state look good, add to tourism. So a few times a year they arrived and left a tip or two before moving on. Sometimes they stayed overnight to get a taste of local flavor, and Roy—who owned the station and bar across the street—tried to play host as best he knew how. But there were never real celebrities, at least none I recognized from the magazine covers spread around the store.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Anybody famous this time?” I asked.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“It isn’t that kind of movie,” the man said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Drake sat up slowly. “What kind of movie is it?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“The no-budget kind.” The grip winked that same old wink. “Something about farmers growing pot, a Mexican cartel, and drug deal gone bad.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“You guys have some funny ideas about places,” Drake said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“The script says we’re also supposed to be in Pennsylvania.” Mr. Hollywood shrugged and signed the receipt with a squiggle. “What you going to do?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I took the carbon copy from his hand. “I like comedies better.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Me too,” he said, eyes lingering here then there. “With happy <em>endings</em>.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I felt my skin heat up. Drake stood with a newfound anger in his face that was hard to not be flattered by. “I think it’s time for you to leave,” he said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The man offered a little laugh. “All right, kid. All right.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">When he was gone, Drake said, “They don’t know a thing about deals gone bad.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Who cares about what they do or don’t know?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“But what right do they have?” Drake glared at me and I felt ashamed, though of what I wasn’t sure. “Coming here to tell us how we live.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I laced my fingers in his, a small attempt to calm him but also say <em>thank you</em>. Except at the first touch he quickly took his hand back as if suddenly stung by some unknown source.<span>  </span><a name="_GoBack"></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">“Do you go to school?” I asked one afternoon, the sky in the distance dark-clouded and full of menace, threatening to pour down a rain that never seemed to come.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“No. It just a bunch of facts. Nothing a real person needs,” he said, still panting from the game. Drake and Dad spent most mornings playing basketball, a one-on-one matchup that each day began innocently enough but eventually verged upon violence. They never kept score, never called fouls, but the ongoing tournament lasted hours at a time, each guarding the other so close you soon couldn’t tell one sweat-soaked body from the other. Usually Drake was the first to tap out, calling it quits when Dad began to almost wrestle the poor kid to the ground. As we sat together, the boy was still shaking from the game, always unnerved by Dad’s sudden strength.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“A diploma gets you away quicker. That’s what Mom said.” I recalled the rasp of her voice taken over by cancer and couldn’t help but smile, though it didn’t feel right on my mouth.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“She sounds smart.” Drake sweated under that bulk of hair like he didn’t know any better. The dreads were like a fur pelt that needed a good shave. There’s a reason every living thing out here with hair hides from the sun during the day—in this heat, we’ve all overcome the need to be human. But Drake seemed to lack a certain ability to adapt and it’d get him in trouble someday. And it’s what I liked best about him.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“What was your mom like?” I asked, sitting in our pool and splashing my skin.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Drake simply looked at the horizon as if an answer was out there amongst the sagebrush and soil. He wore one of Dad’s Harley shirts, but his boots still looked liable to crumble, as if asking to be put out of their misery</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The breeze whipped dirt around. The sun had baked my skin a deep cherry, cooking me pink all the way through. “We should go in. Wind’s going to be bad tonight.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">He gripped the chair, like a branch set to snap. Like something about to detonate at the sound of a say-so. I wrapped a towel around myself and walked behind him, stroking the strings of his hair. They didn’t seem connected to anything actual, just a bunch of floating cables like snakes in my hand. I wondered how long it’d take for someone like me to make hair like that.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Ever think about doing something with this?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">He shook his head, the fat ropes of his hair barely slithering.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I pressed myself against the back of his neck. “Wouldn’t a trim feel better?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Then nobody would recognize me anymore.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I would,” I whispered in his ear. I made my fingers into a pair of scissors, placed a braid between, and feigned a cut until Drake grabbed my wrist and told me to stop.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Who’d have thought he’d felt a thing through that deep network of hairy roots. And I was sorry until he finally let go, leaving a faint bruise on my skin. When he stormed into the house, I wondered who this guy thought he was. Or who I wished him to be. But before I could figure it, the wind rose up and blew over our pool as if I’d been the only thing holding it down all along.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By late July, Drake and Dad slept most of the day. In the evening, after a late shift pumping gas, I’d come home to them on the couch, heads together as if getting ready to sell something to somebody. When I opened the door, they’d break apart and tip their beer cans a bit too casually.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“How was work?” Dad asked, scratching his three-day stubble. He stank like a fish tank.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Six hours and only two customers.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Pathetic,” Dad said. “Not even enough to cover Garret’s electric bill.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Enough to pay <em>ours</em>.” I rubbed my feet as if they ached, though the truth was I sat most nights reading material for classes I going to take this fall at the local community college. I wanted to be ready when I graduated from Roosevelt High, a consolidated school one town over. Sometimes I wondered if my body was trying to keep up with my mind, aggressive in every way.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“What’s that supposed to mean?” Drake asked.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“It means that if you two spent more time finding work than fucking around, we could afford something nice instead of dragging it down the street.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">They stared at each other as if outed at last. Dad hardly left the house anymore, so Drake and I never had a solitary second together. Both of us quietly kept waiting on our fathers, hoping someday they’d come around and take us away from this beach with no sign of water in sight.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Dad said, a cigarette hanging from his lip. They kept a fresh carton in the freezer. The air was filled with a thin haze.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I’m <em>sure</em> you don’t,” I said, standing for punctuation before stomping down the hall.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 2.25pt;">Before sleep, I’d take a cold bath to keep me from running hot. Underwater, my body puckered, I’d picture Drake watching me. Like him witnessing these changes in me would somehow prove their happening, as if maybe his showing up was a way to remind me things moved on. Or maybe stayed the same. Sometimes, when I looked in the mirror, I saw shades of both my parents in me. Their heart-shaped features, the square fit of their shoulders, a thickness about my skin. My reflection a shadowed attempt at imitation, like when combining two pure forms of a chemical and you only end up with a diluted replica of the former—a copy of a photocopy. How they were able to work their looks to get exactly what they wanted seemed beyond me.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 2.25pt; text-indent: 33.75pt;">But tonight, when I wrapped up in a towel and watched myself in the glass—with that long hair covered up, the figure finally out of the way—my own face actually came into focus for once. I imagined Drake’s sky-eyes on me again and thought about what our first time together would be like. And though ridiculous, part of me hoped when we made love, naked and entwined in his hair, we wouldn’t actually have to touch. There wouldn’t even be kissing. In fact, maybe he wouldn’t get hard like guys at school, the biker boys at the pumps. Twins weren’t like that. Instead, we would be lovers without the longing. Isn’t that what true lovers were really supposed to be, after all: people in need without all that unnecessary neediness?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;" align="center">***</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the summer, sleep is miracle enough with the air smothering you like a quilt. Some nights I’d wake suffocating, a small dream twisted in the back of my mind like twine. I’d listen to Drake out back in the shed, snoring as if under the spell of a gentle drug. Except tonight when I woke, it felt like something had been put back out of place. A lock left unlatched, a candle let to burn. But in the kitchen, the dishes still sat in the sink, empties rested on the table. Outside the sun peeked over the horizon. The world looked dusky and new as I approached the noiseless shed. I wondered if this was it. The moment right before the moment I’d join together with the only boy I’d ever found familiar—a lover without family or memory or any of those other obligations. I pictured Drake on the other side of the wall, drenched in sweat, troubled by the same dreams.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">But when I opened the door, his cot was empty. My heart went limp, thinking it’d happened again. What was it with this family where even a replacement part had the urge to leave without a word? No forwarding address. Just another unspoken goodbye.<span>  </span>Back inside, the trailer felt empty except for the dust that got into every crevice. I crossed my arms. Sometimes I couldn’t even feel my own heartbeat through all that extra baggage. Where did it all come from, the sudden stuff growing inside you until it can’t be ignored, or contained, anymore?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Then I heard it. Recently, nights were filled with sad, sparse sounds coming from my father’s room. They weren’t strong cries, but small moans—strange in their slightness. I slowly opened the door to see if he was sniveling in his sleep but, despite the dark, it was easy to tell it wasn’t weeping. These were living noises. Desperation had never had such distinct timbre, a clear-cut quality that could only be created by two things turning into one. I wanted to slam the door but instead stood there, watching those frayed black braids wrestle a man’s desire. It didn’t look beautiful or satisfying. It looked dangerous, almost brutal. Cruel in the way they moved, like a need suddenly turned vicious—a useless craving that no wish could ever fully quench.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I walked outside, the heat on my face feeling good for once, and picked up a basketball. The rubber was worn down, air slightly flat, but otherwise it felt whole in my hand. I bounced it on the dirt and I wondered how long it’d been going on. But there was the way looked at one another. The way they were always smiling. I figured it wasn’t much of a conspiracy. Their discretion so evident it wasn’t even worth the whispering, when the front door opened and a clump of dreads slinked out.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Want to shoot a few?” I asked.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Drake froze like he couldn’t be seen as long as he didn’t move. “What are you doing up?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">“Too hot to sleep.” I couldn’t help a smirk. “How was your night?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">“Still tired.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I bet.” I rolled the ball on my fingertip, but it didn’t last long before toppling.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Drake raised his brow but kept acting like nothing happened, the lie getting buried deeper until it wasn’t there at all. I felt like a child removed from the family secret.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">He took the ball from my hands and shot a jumper. It missed by a mile.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I guess it’s not my game, huh?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I grabbed the ball, gave it a bounce. “What <em>is</em> your game, exactly?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“What do you want from me?” Drake crossed his arms. He stood shockingly still, like he’d stopped breathing on purpose just to prove he could. “It’s like you’re waiting for me to do something. But I don’t have anything. You understand? Nothing.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I drilled another shot, rebounded, and passed him the ball. He didn’t move, letting himself get hit. I picked it up again. “C’mon. Shoot it.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I threw the ball as hard as I could, the sound like a hammer strike against his skin.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Drake watched the ball roll to a stop. Then, before walking away, he simply shook his head and said, “Why is it people who have something never understand about nothing?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I sat at the kitchen table wondering if Mom would’ve been on to them from the start. Or maybe she knew all along. Maybe that’s why I’d liked these boys so much, why she wanted to keep Dad around in the first place: for the simple fact that I wouldn’t have to worry about the clutter when it came to most men and their messes. And though she was wrong, when it came to any kind of intimacy—even when recalling my mother’s face as she drifted off with not even a daughter’s love to keep her company—I also knew families could do a lot worse.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Around noon, Dad walked out of the bedroom without his shirt, his hair spiked, a sleepy grin on his face. “How you doing, honey?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Thinking about Mom.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>He poured a mug of coffee, nodding as he whistled through his teeth. “Quite a woman, your mom. I’ll never forget when I first met her. Wild as the wind.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Though I knew the dangers of bringing up the past, knew the dead ends they shaped, I went ahead and asked it anyway. “Did you know she was having a baby?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span><span> </span>“We had our time together and that was that.” He nodded again and took a seat at the table. “But yeah, I knew. Not right away, but eventually.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>I waited for him to finish, to give some kind of excuse, some kind of reason. But instead he just drank his coffee, still nodding his head.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I wonder what it would’ve been like it we had had <em>our</em> time together?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Dad stared at his mug, tapping his fingers against its rim. “We’re having it now.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span><span> </span>“Yeah. But where the hell have you been?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>He stood, hitched his jeans, and drank his coffee. “What can I tell you? It is what it is.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“What kind of answer is that?” I asked, not quite sure what I wanted from him exactly, what answer would have been the right one. There was no way to win with that kind of question. But it felt like he was looking for a way off the hook, one I wanted to keep him on a bit longer. Except my words only made him laugh under his breath and walk back to bed, but not before telling me, once again, how I was just like my mother.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Drake sat out on the porch all morning, not talking to me. I had to be at work soon, but for now I sat in our pool wearing my bikini, trying to think of the thing that’d make him say something.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“You know he’ll be leaving soon now.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The boy didn’t respond, as if he knew different, as if waiting for me to leave him alone.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I sprayed my arms, leaned back in the water, and let the sun reflect off my skin. “He had a place to rest his head, but things are getting a little tight. And he’ll make plans. Without us.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Drake didn’t make a move until I at last reached back and unclasped my top, letting my breasts breath in the air. “But you don’t have to go, you know.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">He sat there, trying not to look. But when I finally captured his gaze, all he did was roll his eyes as if trying not to laugh. “Hannah, we’re trying to make this easy on you.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">And when I looked up and saw my father’s face staring at me from the kitchen window, I knew plans had already been made. And sitting there in a plastic pool, my breasts looked suddenly silly, like a cartoon of a body that didn’t quite fit.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I slowly stood and covered myself with a towel. “You don’t have to do that.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Drake’s skin was red; his face an angry stone. As I walked inside, I couldn’t help to run my hands through his thick hair once more before quietly telling him it was, at last, time to leave.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Inside, Dad met me at the door, looking younger, something resembling the first time I saw him: clean shaven and soaked in smell-good and holding a saddlebag.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Where are you going?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I have things to take care of.” But when I saw the unsure look about his face, as if he didn’t know where to put his eyes, I knew this wasn’t a trip—it was a get-away.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I pulled the towel tighter around myself. “Can I come with you?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Dad went to touch my bare shoulder. But his hand hesitated above my skin, wet and tan, fingers hovering there—as if he wasn’t sure to yell at me or hug me, give a lecture or not say a word—until he finally pulled back and shouldered his bag. “You’d be better off without us.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Us?” At first the word felt familiar, almost pretty. Like maybe it meant me, maybe mom as well, until I saw that it only included him. And a lost boy with no strings attached.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“You come from strong stock.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I didn’t get it from you.” Then I tried to think of what else Mom would do—laugh at him, slap him, curse his name—when I all wanted was to throw my arms around him, bury my face into his leather vest, smell the raw warmth living there. But I didn’t do that either.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“You’ll be fine.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Will I?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Dad stopped at the door, the handle already in his hand. “Then you’ll make do.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I stood on the porch watching him help Drake onto his bike. Dad gave it a kick, the engine flaring to life, as he said something to the boy holding onto his back. Drake shrugged and smiled and cautiously waved to me, as if uncertain of what the goodbye was all about as they tore down the road, mindlessly spraying gravel left and right, to and fro.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Tonight the bath is cold. The sun and heat won’t rub off. It sits on my skin, radiating from within, a place that can’t be touched with water. Drops drip from the faucet, the porcelain rough with scum. I close my eyes and think about what’s missing. Though everything’s here—the couch, a poor excuse for a rug—the one thing I wasn’t ready for when I walked in after work was this strange silence, as if the very air has been stolen from beneath me.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>I picture two men on the back of a bike, strangers who found a way out and took it for what it was worth, even if it wasn’t much. I try to find comfort there, that maybe I had a hand in making a new something for out of all this nothing. My breasts float like buoys in the water. It’s a sad sight and again I’m curious what Mother would think. How the very thing that kept people in her life had failed her own daughter. Like that first day Dad showed and she almost looked alive again. She didn’t even seem sick, slipping her skeletal body into my old clothes that were too small for me now but fit her like a quick road to recovery. Until one day she pulled me close, took out a tube of lipstick, and said to never let him go, not like she had. But before she had a chance to improve a thing about me, I gave her a cutting glare, told her how desperation wasn’t becoming on her, and walked out the room. And when she passed away that evening, only her old lover by her side, I knew it’d be me who asked him to stay. If simply for a way to say sorry.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">But this is better. Put out to pasture—a story we understood all too well. So tonight I’ll lie in my mother’s bed, share the same sleep, sweating out dreams. I try to guess about them, those dreams. How they often seem so real but wrong: a replica of a place where you’re not entirely you but close to it. Like an out of body experience between two worlds, both of which you can see but can’t quite touch. I hope I have that kind of dream again, where waking and sleeping feel like the same pursuit. But before sleep comes the heat. It’s something to depend on around here. The one thing you can rely upon when everything else seems to melt and evaporate.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"> If ever more ravened, junked, numb-sconced<br />
I could not recall it, sopping in aftermath<br />
dusk’s blossom bock, ink-musk ale<br />
at rusted window screen, the annual carnival<br />
a neon embolism blurring<em> </em>the horizon’s black seam<br />
that from the brine of my dispirits<br />
struck me as the portajohn &amp; ticket-littered<br />
portal of hypocrisy and the soul’s mojo shutting down.<br />
Then you, scrabble in the bamboo,<br />
fluent rapacious pelt, burnt, elegant-booted streak<br />
flecking the despond no longer just mine<br />
with a shiver estival that –<span>  </span>even as language cages<br />
it now, a loping scriptural and starving –<br />
every word of it I winged to you then a barbarous traveling.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -1in;"> “all are mere productions of the brain”<br />
<span>    </span>J. Swift, “On Dreams”</p>
<p>Midnight in the deanery, gangrenous flies,<br />
his mind having moved from honey pot<br />
to excrement, as when God invades the ear.<br />
Vertiginous, silver, trees of the past are weeping<br />
into the canal.<span>  </span>Eels, slim as women’s ankles,<br />
signal beneath the pond’s glass.<br />
Fleet clouds suddenly, Presto!<br />
In the Sluttery mirror, memory’s weeds,<br />
his Ladies – Skinnibonia, Pooh, Skinage, Governor Huff,<br />
brats, rakes, all! &amp; esp. those known “on horseback.”<br />
Something like Regret:<span>  </span>the small married one, cowering<br />
at the locked drawer whom he swiped &amp; pinched,<br />
forced by mouth with rum before turning gravely away to prayer,<br />
the Chancery finding him finally unsound of Mind &amp; Memory,<br />
altered for the worse.<span>  </span>Sinuous eels of the trousers of Ireland,<br />
pink, freckled flesh, fetid swamp of jock, pubis,<br />
clenching menstrual flowers &amp; vaginal sponges,<br />
sheep’s-gut johnnies tied to the flagging horn with red ribbons.<br />
Never much one for that, now Self in fugue:<br />
<em>I hardly understand one word I write.</em><br />
He’s a ruined mill up-river, greens martyred,<br />
rotting in the shallows – <em>hear me, Stella</em> –<br />
No Romantick, but his scrupulous, pared nails,<br />
clumsy tutor’s hands once fumbled in her tiny doll house.<br />
Giant thoughts, minute spoons, forks, dung beetles, men, swallows<br />
lasso and devour the brain &amp; all its unconsummated vistas<br />
still gloaming behind his feminine, his bent &amp; supple spines.</p>

was in black and white,<br />
or sometimes in the sepia<br />
memory tints things with.</p>
<p>The soundtrack was a Victrola<br />
playing “I’ll Get By.”<br />
The stars were a father<br />
with his important mustache;</p>
<p>a maid in the kitchen shelling peas;<br />
a mother who looked<br />
a lot like me, but beautiful,<br />
who wore serenity like a badge,</p>
<p>who scripted our lives<br />
and never flubbed her lines.<br />
Listen to the staccato music<br />
high heels make as they move</p>
<p>down the polished hallways<br />
of the past.<span>  </span>Absorb<br />
the darkness of coal piled up<br />
outside the house, smudging</p>
<p>what seem like mountains<br />
of snow at the curb.<span>  </span>Today,<br />
speeded up and in color,<br />
my life flashes by in short takes:</p>
<p>a curtain of blue sky behind<br />
the arc of a child on a swing;<br />
the dogwoods dying one by one,<br />
punctuating other losses;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">the seductive rustle of pages<br />
turning.<span>  </span>And as I settle<br />
into my part, the final<br />
credits start to roll.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’ve all been in towns<br />
that wouldn’t have us, whose woods<br />
beyond the cemetery<br />
hide houses made of leaves,<br />
their windows lit low<br />
by peat fires, the slow stink<br />
of heat rising through trees<br />
then sinking into grass, the mounds<br />
that seem to shrug and settle.<br />
And the exiles we are, in overcoats<br />
and heavy shoes, we present<br />
our sticky faces to the tellers<br />
and soda jerks, the lovely girls<br />
cracking gum at the luncheonettes,<br />
and we’re told to leave, simple<br />
as that, told to walk our sorry selves<br />
back to sea, back to sod, back<br />
to wherever we come from which, funny<br />
enough, is a place a lot like<br />
this one, happy once and<br />
lovely and now turned<br />
like the moon to black.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">Home is not what the woman<br />
had imagined. Late fall, the fields</p>
<p>are cropped to stubble, the mountain<br />
already rust and smoke. The trees</p>
<p>must have flamed here but she’s<br />
too late. The man has threaded himself</p>
<p>through the trees on their best<br />
black horse, and a hawk has dropped</p>
<p>its shadow on the child and won’t<br />
lift it away. The girl is learning to read</p>

reveals something peculiar, wholly new.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal"> The man has been gone so long,<br />
his own child won’t know him.</p>
<p>She and the woman, they must have<br />
their own stories now, their own songs—</p>
<p>some for hauling wood and water,<br />
others to sweeten the girl’s sleep.</p>
<p>The wilderness is a strange place<br />
to slumber, always the other-worldly</p>
<p>howl of something too close.<br />
The man has been gone so long,</p>
<p>working over the mountain, maybe<br />
his child’s hair will be dark and wild</p>
<p>as feathers, her eyes more yellow,<br />
hawk-eyes always spying birds</p>
<p>in the leaves. When he left, the girl<br />
was moon-faced, her wispy curls</p>
<p>as gold as his long ago. But memory’s<br />
spell is always broken. The man knows</p>
<p>her curls will darken as his did,<br />
like honey left too long in the jar.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoFooter">Many men moving, trying to get something<br />
out of the lake. Bending. Pulling.<br />
From a raft with yellow crime tape<br />
around it. I have to stop dancing<br />

and turn off the music to hone in.<br />
The silver offering plate of the lake stops<br />
spinning. What hovers at the hooks’ ends?<br />
Tooth by tooth, scar by scar, what who<br />

The men kneel. They yank and tug.<br />
What arrives to eradicate the kingdom?<br />
What enters the eye of always?<sub><br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/02/hike-to-the-black-madonna.mp3">Hike to the Black Madonna</a></p>
<p>The aching muscles of my calves began to tremble just as the forest broke away. A white river threaded the valley floor far below. I turned to the right and above the tips of pine emerged the Sümela Monastery. This windowed building of six stories—seamlessly carved out of sheer rock—opened to the sky, its arched doorways shrouded in cloud I had perceived as mist from far below.</p>
<p>In 1930, a fire gutted the library, guest rooms, courtyards, church, and monk housing. It was only seven years after the new Turkish government relocated local Orthodox Greeks to Greece. Among the skeletal wall-remains, 1200 meters above sea level, tourists appeared and disappeared; secured to their heads were hardhats the color of lemons, an illusion of safety amid falling rock and slippery walkways.</p>
<p>The clash of the mountain panorama and cliff-side building amplified as I walked among the monastery’s dissolving walls. Graffiti-carved names—Nurten, Yavir, and Nebile—looked like words of prayer. On the interiors of some walls, sun and wind peeled the paint off frescoes even as I studied them. Cut out sections revealed layers of plaster over rough stone. Vandals gouged out saints’ eyes on paintings within arm’s reach. In one, too high for violence, the hand of Jesus compelled Lazarus’s body from an open tomb. And was this Mary, head halo-wrapped, body cloaked in red? At her center, the infant Jesus holding his arms out in blessing. The walls of my childhood church seemed to rise up, and I felt awe just as I did praying before the fourth station of the cross, the priest’s words <em>Jesus meets his mother</em> in my ears.</p>
<p>I stood within these stories overwhelmed by an interior of debris: desire, conception, death, and resurrection held together in stone even as that stone decayed. How was I to know then that the icon—the Black Madonna—serene in her wall niche, was missing? Mary and I gazed at each other with serious eyes, and I searched through a jumble of stories, time and space blurring—a choice to look for the woman inside.</p>
<p align="center">* * *</p>
<p>Trabzon: our school’s-out destination. Neither Chad, my boyfriend, nor I had traipsed across northeastern Turkey yet. With my two-year teaching stint in Tarsus complete, I planned to unwind from an exhausting semester before returning to the States for graduate school. Only halfway through his contract, Chad would be back in Turkey in August. I hoped our time alone would strengthen our relationship before the “long distance” phase.</p>
<p>We walked across tarmac toward a twenty-seater airplane, scarlet-lettered <em>Bodrum</em> emblazoned upon its white paint. A colleague of ours nicknamed Bodrum “Bed Room:” a place to swim, barhop, and seduce tourists. A rather sinful city.</p>
<p>“That’s hilarious. We’re flying to Trabzon in the <em>Bodrum</em>,” I said to Chad, reaching for his hand. “It’s like flying to Las Vegas in the <em>Chastity</em>. Instead of beaches and bars, we’ll be touring Orthodox churches.”</p>
<p>He smiled and slung his arm around my backpack.</p>
<p>I pictured the Sümela monastery, named for a Greek word stemming from “dark” or “black.” Later I would learn about the Black Madonna icon and ponder the incongruity of her slender, European nose and thin lips with her black hair and dark skin. Like all Black Madonnas, her contrasting features inspired conjecture. Centuries of stories, deposited within the vessel of Mary’s body, shifted over time.</p>
<p>Chad sighed and stretched out, staring at the seatback in front of him. I read this as preoccupation, as invitation to initiate conversation. Nearby a passenger shoved a duffel bag into an overhead bin; others squeezed themselves between armrests. I pulled out the seat belt and buckled it across my waist.</p>
<p>“Hey. I’m sure I’m not,” I said to Chad. “I shouldn’t have mentioned I was late until I knew for sure. But if you keep being worried, you’ll make me worried.” I tried to catch his eye.</p>
<p>“We’re always safe, but you said you’re never this late.” Did he think I was lying? “Let’s not talk about this right now.” He pulled out a book from his bag.</p>
<p>The flight attendant’s ring glinted as she set the tea down on the mini-tray on my lap. I plunked a sugar cube into my glass, a tiny vase curved like a woman’s body. The grains of sugar broke free and floated up before merging into the steaming sienna tea. One of my hands drifted to my flat belly, the other to the rim of the glass.</p>
<p>“It’s probably stress,” I said. “If I don’t obsess about it, it’ll come. Besides, this is our <em>vacation</em>. Just the two of us.”</p>
<p>His answer: a squeeze of my hand before opening the book.</p>
<p>I interpreted this as affirmation. As I sipped the hot tea my mind turned the kaleidoscope of possibilities. A half-inch twist changed the geometric slips of paper—me, Chad, school, one year’s time—from a mandala of jewels into an aqua and russet burst, one version of the story. Another? Twelve years of Catholic school burned The Visitation behind my eyes. I imagine Mary’s hair as the color of walnuts. Cooking lamb, she tucks a stray curl under her hair covering and lapses into a daydream about a cute neighbor. Gabriel drops by; her kaleidoscope turns.</p>
<p>“God’s tapped you,” the angel explains. “What do you say?” She’s given a choice and thinks about it, but scripture doesn’t convey silence well. Her “yes” inverts the shape of her future. She could’ve said no.</p>
<p>Minus the angel and miraculous conception, I thought when faced with pregnancy, I’d watch mirrors and light blur the colors before me. I’d search for an answer within.</p>
<p align="center">* * *</p>
<p>With no summit of the Zigana Mountains to inspire us yet, Chad and I trekked the path snaking through the forest. The saturated air infused each deep breath with the scent of pine and slowed my pace. Tight from travel, my muscles strained to push, and I negotiated the curves of the steep ascension with care. Chad’s muscles, remembering thousands of bouldering hikes, propelled him with ease, yet sweat trickled down his neck. After an hour, my t-shirt and jeans stuck to my skin; I wished I had braved shorts despite the stares of disapproval I’d receive. The narrowed eyes of men always conjured fragments of a memory: a man’s hand on my shoulder; a wall closing in; my fingers squeezing his throat; his feet hitting pavement. I still breathed through the anger and fear summoned by memories of this attempted attack. With my blonde hair and blue eyes, had he assumed I was a “Natasha”—a Russian sex worker?</p>
<p>Our steps regularized as the forest thickened, the canopy of leaves shielding us from direct sun. Partway up, Chad and I veered off the main trail and followed an overgrown dirt path. It ended at ruins. We rested on a chunk of stone and sipped from water bottles. The smell of the crumbling house—two partial walls and pile of stacked rubble—was a blend of mold and piss. Perhaps this dwelling had once sheltered pilgrims seeking Sümela’s sacred springs. According to legend, the Black Madonna asked angels to remove her icon from Athens where Saint Luke had sent his painting. Mary chose this mountain and she created a place of healing.</p>
<p>Back on the dusty trail, I focused on my walking sandals, one step in front of the other. Every few minutes I caught a glimpse of a brown trunk swathed in moss or a branch veiled in leaves of translucent green, each leaf a halo of light.</p>
<p align="center">* * *</p>
<p>Chad and I had trouble finding a hotel in Trabzon. On the outside we were tourists—good business—but once hotel clerks opened our Turkish work permits (they designated our status as teachers which often meant cheaper prices) and studied the inside, they read a different story. The permit marked us “single,” but we asked for one room. They scrutinized me, listening to my clumsy Turkish. “No vacancy,” they finally said, snapping the permits shut.</p>
<p>I doubted them. The number of Natashas in Trabzon reinforced their stereotypes of non-Turkish women. I had become accustomed to, although never comfortable with, Turkish men glancing at my short blonde hair and blue eyes and asking me for sex. Walking home from the market, a sack of tomatoes and carrots in my arms, I would pass a small group of men leaning against a wall and smoking cigarettes. Avoiding eye contact that might “invite” a remark, I stared at the back of women’s tight ponytails or fringed headscarves. I imagine one of the smokers noticed my hair first. He probably elbowed his friend. Taking a drag of his cigarette, he would exhale: “Hello, Natasha” followed by a flurry of Turkish. The first month I blushed; the second I glared even though it amused them. When their “Hey, Natasha, Natasha” faded, my neck relaxed, shoulders softened, and pace slowed. I marched faster if one followed me for several blocks. I tried to ignore the ways men interpreted my exterior, the stories they assumed from the color of my hair and eyes.</p>
<p>We secured a hotel room after two proprietors refused us. Nestled among a series of red-shingled businesses, Hotel Nur topped a deeply sloping street. Two steep flights of stairs ended with our room. Once inside the door, Chad took four steps and stood in front of a nightstand between twin beds. The angle of light, streaming from a window, illuminated the thickness of his body, corded muscles from rock climbing softened by slight cushioning—the result of his own great cooking. I dropped my backpack on the right bed and pushed open the only other door. The closet-sized bathroom was just the right size for a saint’s niche. I could imagine Mary Magdalene—from a fresco featured in my guidebook—smoothing out her hair in the mirror. Her elongated fingers and neck, pale cheeks, and somber expression created a version of this woman I didn’t recognize; I always imagined her as curvy, a bit plump even, with knowing eyes, thick, loose hair, and a slight smile on her lips.</p>
<p>Only my head reflected in the mirror above the basin as I washed my hands and face. When I opened the door, Chad stood there, a pregnancy test in his hand.</p>
<p>“Where’d you get this?” I asked, touching the corner of the box.</p>
<p>“Lisa had one and gave it to me before we left.”</p>
<p>My hand recoiled. “You told her?” I wondered how many other friends knew about this possibility.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well I was worried that you’d be worried.”</p>
<p>“I’m not,” I replied, folding my arms in front of me.</p>
<p align="center">* * *</p>
<p>I put off the test by suggesting dinner. At the restaurant a case of fresh <em>alabalık</em> laid out on crushed ice greeted us, reminding me of my father’s autumn catches of trout in the cold streams of northern Iowa. We pointed to two we wanted and ordered tomato and cucumber salad, pita, and lentil soup. I placed a napkin over the head of my fish; its blank, watching eye bothered me as I separated meat from bones. Chad chatted about his plans to leave in three days for the States. I would travel alone for another week before meeting a friend in Istanbul and sightseeing for two weeks with her.</p>
<p>“Do you have to go back this week? Maybe you could change your departure date and go back when I meet Melissa.”</p>
<p>“That would be impossible. I’ve been planning a summer of mountain-climbing and beer-drinking for months.”</p>
<p>I don’t remember the rest of our conversation or if there was one.</p>
<p>When we returned to Hotel Nur, an actual Natasha—the first I’d seen—lingered a few doors down from the entrance. Her body was lean, all angles, especially the way her knees jutted out of her orange mini skirt. The only curve I could see was the curl of her bobbed platinum hair.</p>
<p>Chad insisted on the test. The sun made the burnt-red rooftops shimmer as I turned from him and stepped into the bathroom. His way, I figured, would produce an answer. Clarify things. I eased onto my haunches and balanced over a porcelain hole with cup in hand. Through the crack in the door I heard the call to prayer, and afterwards, a Russian voice arguing with someone on the street below our room.</p>
<p>When Mary Magdalene crashed Jesus’ dinner party, he recognized a fellow healer, one who could soothe with her caress. He touched her chin as she perfumed his feet with oil and turned her face up to his. “Things change,” he said when they were eye to eye. “Come with me. I’ll never leave you alone.”  The next day I would see a fresco of Mary Magdalene with regret painted in her eyes.  She would appear to weep into my hair from the ceiling.</p>
<p>I peed, then handed Chad the stick still wet with urine.</p>
<p align="center">* * *</p>
<p>I wish I could say I saw Sümela’s Black Madonna when I explored the monastery, but her image painted on cracked black wood and framed in eighteenth-century silver metalwork had disappeared. Maybe she resembled Our Lady of Jasna Gora: almond-shaped eyes half closed; a svelte nose lengthening her oval face; complexion the color of coffee with cream; a halo setting off the gold borders of her headpiece. Would her image have inspired me to wash my hands in her sacred spring or put the water to my lips? Perhaps I would have felt a sudden lift of spirit, a tingling from head to toe. I would have been able to step back from my life and trust everything would turn out okay.</p>
<p>Instead, I found stories of Black Madonnas long after my relationship with Chad was over. Two days after the hike, backpack slung over his arm, he climbed onto the airport bus. I waited for him to turn around, to change his mind. His bus roared away, the tires churning up a cloud of dust. On the outside our relationship wasn’t over—and wouldn’t be for another year—but on some level we’d both abandoned it.</p>
<p>I traveled west along the Black Sea following a route the spiritual descendants of Barnabus and Sophronius, the hermits credited with bringing Sümela’s Black Madonna to Anatolia. After the monastery was founded, the two traveled throughout Anatolia, the Balkans, and Russia to sell copies of their famous icon. In Sinop I said a prayer at St. Anne’s, the church of Mary’s mother, whose image time had transformed into a winged figure without a face. Alone in Safronbolu, I rambled into quiet neighborhoods where I watched women hang rugs on clotheslines and sweep stone steps.  Sometimes I stood on the side of a street to watch people sauntering by, worries or hope mapped on their faces. The breeze orchestrated their voices into a medley, tuning into my heartbeat, and I dissolved into the current for a moment.</p>
<p>Some scholars conjecture that artists darkened Mary’s image to illustrate a text from the Song of Songs: “I am black and beautiful;” others associate Black Madonnas with ancient earth goddesses; others say they express a feminine power not fully conveyed by a pale-skinned Mary and link them to Mary Magdalene. Perhaps the painter never intended her to be a “Black Madonna” and soot from centuries of burning candles turned her pigment dark. Perhaps she ended up so many miles from home by accident, a wrinkle in her predestined story. Perhaps she felt obliged to say yes. Perhaps the ways men looked at her fueled her desire to seek shelter—any shelter.</p>
<p>Sümela’s Black Madonna never appeared to me on that hike. She was gone. Or she was everywhere. Inside the monastery, hues of paintings lightened only to be darkened again by shadows of passing clouds. Stones crumbled underfoot—the possibilities in narratives conceived. And that interior debris, what’s left of desire, shifted. I wonder if Mary would choose, as I have, the stories that sustain her. I wonder if she would exist, as I have, in the spaces that they blur.</p>

<span>Here, where I am buffeted,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;barely able to stand,<br />
a kestrel hangs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;impossibly still in the wind.<br />
I envy its otherness,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its look of being somewhere else—</span></p>
<p>far from where I’ve scrabbled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up the slope, unloosening scree<br />
as I climbed, lacking altogether<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the grace of this hawk<br />
becalmed in mid air.  <em>Becalmed</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;despite gusts strong enough<br />
to rend a sail in the firth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that blue hem<br />
at the end of these hills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want down.<br />
Without tripping over moles<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tunneling their runways<br />
under my feet. Sheep, stones, shrew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;half-hidden in the upland grasses—<br />
all of us tilting toward sea level,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exposed as the skylark<br />
and golden plover that veer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the airspace between Scald Law<br />
and the kestrel’s barely quivering wings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a recurring dream<br />
I have of hovering, the calm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call kestrel in this storm.<br />
Waking I know even the bird’s lift<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is short-lived. The hair’s-breadth<br />
between heather and heath,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those seconds before it plunges<br />
headlong into a vole.</p>

<p>The male tweezes a bald millet stalk<br />
off a sahara of graveled paper.</p>
<p>The pert watch movements of his head<br />
ignite a ember on each cheek, buff bright</p>
<p>the beak’s rose hip hue. His elderberry eye<br />
subjects this meter cubed of universe</p>
<p>to further scrutiny. The struggles of<br />
a downy filament attract him.</p>
<p>With these two finds he alights, caresses<br />
the injection-molded branch. But there is</p>
<p>no flaw to catch on, no way to make a start.<br />
A problem he sets aside for the moment,</p>
<p>pinning it down with his foot. In the dusky<br />
corner his mate dangles off brass wires,</p>
<p>mobile as a chandelier earring.<br />
Extending her wing, she makes him</p>
<p>more to find, fussing<br />
a small snow from the hot and pearly hollow.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Making a wall stone by stone<br />
as you used to relish<br />
doing, or stacking stone on stone<br />
in the woods to make a cairn,<br />
is like building a sentence<br />
word by word.  If that’s so,<br />
this poem is a word cairn,<br />
and the wall that shambles about<br />
the woodlot, losing stones<br />
to frost heaves and tree roots,<br />
is a sentence that won’t parse,<br />
however long I tinker with it.<br />
Today I’m wondering<br />
what I can say, having listened<br />
hard, without understanding,<br />
as you explained “a position”<br />
when it’s only clear<br />
that the words you utter don’t<br />
fit the thought<br />
you claim is clear when it’s closeted<br />
in your head, failing when you try it<br />
on your tongue.  Some poets<br />
go after “something not sayable”—<br />
how one might describe color<br />
or the idea of God.  You’re after<br />
simply how to translate<br />
the vivid _____ that stutters across<br />
your brain, right hemisphere to left.<br />
Imagine the. . . <em>frustration</em> is too easy.<br />
Try <em>sacrifice</em>, an unwilling one at that.<br />
“Too great a sacrifice makes<br />
a stone of the heart”—<br />
you used to quote Yeats<br />
when anger sent you off into a silent<br />
retreat.  “Come back,”<br />
I’d call across the wall. “Let’s keep trying.”<br />
That was years ago; you don’t remember.<br />
“I like being <em>provisional</em>,”<br />
you do remember saying,<br />
back when your life lay ahead<br />
unbounded, and you were young.<br />
<em>Being provisional</em>, is that my aim now,<br />
out for a walk in the woods<br />
with the dog?  <em>Come here</em>,<br />
I call, <em>come here now, </em>and he won’t,<br />
preoccupied with scents made rich by rain.<br />
Nothing promises us <em>now and forever,</em><br />
only <em>now. </em>And just now,<br />
letting the stubborn dog<br />
and everything else in my life<br />
just be what it is—surely a form of<br />
surrender—I muse<br />
and shift from one outcropping of stone<br />
to the next flank of stone<br />
half-buried in beech leaves,<br />
lifting loose, irregular chunks of smaller stone,<br />
their moss a green-fuse green,<br />
still others unevenly spangled<br />
by pastel ovals of lichen—<br />
stacking the stones.<br />
Raising cairn after cairn,<br />
mute stone after mute stone.<br />
Knowing that each cairn, or any<br />
one stone, may list in place<br />
or tumble, unbalanced<br />
by the least leaf or spit of rain<br />
before I return<br />
to the stones, to lift and coax them,<br />
to turn them—so much is guesswork—and try again.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hayscent fern in one windowpane, rhododendron<br />
in another, red barn siding—</p>
<p>you’re staring out the window, as if what you see<br />
out there might wake</p>
<p>the inner word you want, that fugitive, unfaithful<br />
word wed now to silence.  As we wait,</p>
<p>I try to imagine your brain as a window<br />
fitted with white squares of mist—then frost,</p>
<p>then snow thickening on one pane, on another,<br />
and another . . . .  Slowly</p>
<p>the ferns vanish, scent and root.  For you, each moment<br />
arrives and departs in a swift</p>
<p>migration, like the tanagers that didn’t, this spring, return.<br />
Mist over the memory of tanagers.</p>
<p>And now I blank out the panes that frame two oaks<br />
and a rope hammock. . .</p>
<p>a void where once were form and fragrance,<br />
tall trees and the faint</p>
<p>pattern of braided rope—an impression (now<br />
I remember) a fossil</p>
<p>printed on my firm thighs and onto the smooth<br />
under skin of your arms—after</p>
<p>we’d slept there, barely an hour, suspended in sunlight.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The leaves are turning, one by one carried away in the crisp wind.<br />
In one letter he penned<br />
Coleridge turned away, calling love<br />
a local anguish he meant to leave<br />
behind him.  <em>Away, away</em>,<br />
says the blue and gold day, and no one hears it but the wind, whose law<br />
it echoes.  The dog has a red ball to chase.<br />
You pick a flat, perfect stone for the wall you hope to live long enough<br />
to rebuild.  I prune<br />
briars, pick burrs from the dog’s fur.<br />
I teach <em>come</em> and <em>sit</em>.  <em>Sit here—</em><br />
a longer sit beneath the cedars.  The grass is freshly cut,<br />
sun low, all the energy<br />
of a summer day rushing into bulb and root.<br />
The dog runs off, returns.  The stones balance<br />
steeply.  Good work.  Good dog.  This is<br />
heaven.  Sit.  Stay.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I suited up for Little League at age ten, shrugging into a maroon nylon top and pulling on my gleaming white pants rimmed with thick elastic at the waist, I distinguished myself by carrying a wooden bat to the plate. It was a thirty-two inch Worth cut from a blonde ash tree, and with its thick handle and barrel it likely weighed at least two or three pounds. This was an odd choice for a Little Leaguer, since lightweight metal bats had more pop and far more durability. But I was a purist. Wood was what the pros used, the kind of bat that met the ball with a gut-tingling crack, unlike the ping of aluminum, which sounded more like a sound effect on a video game than a good, honest hit. I knew my bat could break, and every time I caught a pitch off the tip or close to the handle, the vibration stung my hands. But when I found the sweet spot, when a pitch came in at belt level and I got good wood on it, the shock washed over my whole body like I’d jumped into a lake.</p>
<p>I needed that feeling for more reasons than I could express, and I gave it my whole attention, the way I forgot everything else while eating huckleberry cheesecake. It was a form of love, that sweet contact, like the bliss I’d seen on other people’s faces in church, hands raised skyward, tears streaming down their upturned cheeks. And when I knew the ball would clear the fence, when I saw the pitch fly from the barrel and felt the echo in my chest and <em>knew</em>, it was a form of truth.</p>
<p>Baseball was my father’s game, one of the few things we had in common and the only exception he made to banning television from our home. Every fall when the World Series began, he borrowed an old black and white set from my grandfather, and we propped it on a chair in the living room, where we fussed with the antennae until the grainy picture snapped into focus. It was there on the calico rug, lying on my belly with my chin in my hands, that I watched my team, the Mets, win the 1986 World Series. And two years later on the same tiny screen I saw Kirk Gibson hobble to the plate for the Dodgers, my father’s team, and launch a game-winning home run against the Oakland Athletics despite a pulled hamstring and aching knees. For a few moments as Gibson limped around the bases and we jumped on the dining room linoleum to high-five each other, dishes rattling in the cupboard, my father and I were one. He coached each of my teams from the pee-wee league through Babe Ruth, managing even the All-Star teams. Every time I stepped to the plate, I could feel him watching from the third base coach’s box, and I wanted to get that feeling back, knowing if I hit a line drive or a long ball, all my errors would be forgiven and he’d give my shoulder a squeeze.</p>
<p>There was no way for me to know when we first began playing catch on our lawn around my fourth or fifth birthday that my father was trying to get back something he’d lost. But in the next few years, as I started tee-ball and he began grooming me for Little League, I knew he expected more than I could give. He often urged me to throw harder, frustrated by my noodle arm, but arm strength is one of the raw talents only nature bestows, so my earliest memories of catch are laced with a sense of struggle against my body, against myself. Our yard was a steep hillside flanked by an apple orchard and a vegetable garden, an excellent sledding hill in the winter but a poor stand-in for a baseball field with its uneven footing. More often than not, I tripped over my own feet while trying to get under a pop fly that my father tossed overhead, losing my bearings while running uphill. The grounders he threw came at me like curveballs, angling downhill as they bounced my way. My errant throws, which increased the more he hollered for me to put some heart into it, usually landed in a bank of tall grass behind the raspberry canes. My father was not a patient man, and the longer it took to hunt for a lost ball the sharper his return throw would be, increasing the odds that I’d miss it on a short hop and have to chase it down the hill into the ditch, where a row of birch and fir trees fronted our country road. No matter how angry we’d get or how many minutes we wasted wading through the grass, we kept at it until dusk, calling it quits when the air began to pulse with crickets and we could no longer see. These marathon games of catch, though they often felt like failure, were my father’s best attempts at love. I would later suit up for football and basketball and even dabble in tennis, but there was never any question that my first loyalty lay with my father’s game.</p>
<p>He was a second baseman, small for his age as a child and still short as a man, though his chest and arms filled out enough to give him power at the plate. After dropping out of junior college in Arizona, where he’d gone to play baseball and failed to make the cut, he transferred back to Montana to study civil engineering. Schooled in the science of land surveying and longhand drafting, he was more at home with a stack of maps and a calculator than with a novel. He read the Bible aloud every day before dinner, a chapter at a time, in the same methodical way he wiped the table down after we finished the meal, yet faith was more than ritual to him. He’d been swept up in the Jesus People revival in Seattle, where he learned to speak in tongues, a form of ecstatic utterance some Christians believed allowed the Holy Spirit to take control of a person and speak through them in other languages. I struggled to reconcile my meticulous father, the man who triple checked his calculations after packing his yellow surveying tripod around the perimeter of a property boundary, with the man who could surrender control of his own tongue and speak in a stream of what sounded like gibberish to me.</p>
<p>Our church was the kind with loud preaching and dancing and tambourines jingle-jangling through the worship service. We gathered in an abandoned Forest Service building on a hill overlooking the town of Troy, a space we shared with a Catholic church which met early in the morning and dispersed an hour before we arrived to set up a hundred metal folding chairs in a half moon, facing a piano and a large screen where the words to our worship songs appeared, magnified and bathed in light.  It was there I heard stories about revival meetings where a woman with the gift of tongues might speak in Chinese, not understanding a word coming out of her own mouth, learning after the service that a man from the Sichuan Province had heard God speaking directly to him, in his native dialect, in her voice. It was frightening to imagine the voice of God rumbling through my own vocal chords, but it seemed like a super power, a way for the body to feel proof of what the spirit believed. I clapped and sang along with the others, waiting for the spirit to take possession of me, but this seemed beyond my strength, like the games of catch in the backyard, where I could never quite throw hard enough.</p>
<p>The sermons at the Troy Christian Fellowship were much like my father’s coaching, impatient with mediocrity, constantly calling us to higher living. One morning the preacher worked himself into a sweat, pacing before us as if the church were a giant dugout, our buttocks clenched against the hard chairs. There was no stage, and he was not a tall man, but he seemed to tower above us. His text was the book of Exodus, where God delivers the Israelites from bondage in Egypt and calls Moses up Mount Sinai to receive the commandments the people are to live by. “Thou shalt have no other gods before me,” the preacher quoted from memory, his voice rising to a shout as he finished the verse, “for I the Lord thy God am a <em>jealous</em> God.” He stopped to let the words sink in, a vein bulging from his shiny forehead as he stared us down. He went on to tell the story of the golden calf, how even as Moses stood on the mountain receiving the bedrock of Hebrew law directly from the mouth of God, the people grew impatient and melted their own earrings and made a golden calf, which they worshiped as the god that had brought them out of slavery.</p>
<p>“Imagine,” the preacher hissed, his voice fallen into a whisper, “Imagine yourself as a father who has brought up his child in the truth, only to watch him turn away, only to watch him destroy his life at the card table or cast all his passion into gathering riches or grow so proud with learning that he says, ‘There is no God.’” The preacher clutched his Bible to his chest and crouched as if he’d caught a hard grounder in the groin.</p>
<p>“You would not give up on that child,” the preacher went on, his voice building once more into crescendo, “because the love of a father is a jealous love, jealous for its own flesh and blood the way God is jealous for his chosen ones, ready to let loose his wrath on them if they waver in what they know is the truth.”</p>
<p>I considered myself a believer then, not because I felt at home among the faithful straining forward in their chairs, but because I felt the power of those sermons every week and lived in fear for my soul. I looked at the faces around me on Sunday mornings — women weeping with what seemed to be joy, arms raised as they stood and swayed to the music, men shouting amens to the other men who marched before us possessed by the Word and the Spirit and the great urgency of sharing the bad news of human nature and the good news of God’s chastising rod — and I could not consider myself one of their number, even though I believed. I knew the rules of the game, but as I grew into a man’s body and felt more enraptured by a woman’s bosom bouncing at the front of the church as she shook her tambourine than by the words in the song she sang, it seemed certain I wasn’t helping the team. My father sang with his eyes closed, rocking in his cowboy boots with his hands cupped at his sides as if he were waiting for rain, and my mother pounded out chords on the chipped yellow keys of the upright piano. I believed they had a grip on something real, a sensual spirit force that slipped through my fingers and left me feeling empty and cold as I sang the words on the gleaming screen, watching the tambourine player shake her whole body, breasts bobbing beneath her blue paisley dress.</p>
<p>But when I wrapped my hands around the handle of my wooden bat and ripped a pitch into the outfield, the crack echoing down the barrel into my chest, it was like the voice of God in my throat, and my body and spirit flew together down the baseline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was old enough for Little League, my father drove me to Libby for that year’s draft. Libby was twenty miles away, which meant an hour round-trip most week nights through the summer, but it was worth it because the Libby All-Stars could go all the way to the Little League World Series if they were good enough. Troy had an unsanctioned league, where the uniforms featured business names like Acco Cable and ASARCO, the local silver mine, but in Libby the teams were named for professional clubs, and the draft for rookies – that year’s pool of eligible ten-year-olds – was meant to mimic a major league tryout.</p>
<p>On the day of the draft, all of the coaches gathered at the Libby baseball complex, two adjacent fields sandwiched between the Kootenai River and the railroad tracks. My father and I drove the twenty miles from Troy mostly in silence, my belly awash with excitement when we crunched into the gravel parking lot behind the backstop and joined the crowd. The coaches put us through a series of drills, fielding grounders and flies, playing catch, and taking a little batting practice, and I performed well enough to be one of the top picks, rattling several practice pitches against the chain link fence in the outfield. As in the major leagues, the worst team had first dibs in the draft, and I was dismayed to learn by the end of the evening that I’d been chosen by the Mets. But after the tears wore off and I met my teammates for practice, a group of scrawny boys nearly all smaller than me, I accepted my fate. Though my father played for the Dodgers in Little League and had rooted for the professional team ever since, it was clear my loyalty from then on lay with the Mets, and I began reading the box scores every day for Dwight Gooden and Darryl Strawberry and Ray Knight, counting the days to the postseason, when my grandfather would lend us the little black-and-white box and I’d get to watch the pros at home.</p>
<p>My father began as an assistant coach for the Libby Mets, but after my first year he took over as manager, throwing all of his competitive energy into the team. He had played softball until then, his well-oiled glove gleaming in the closet, where it sat on top of his cleats. He bought his softball cleats a half size small, so he could soften them with mink oil and pack them with shoe stretchers until they fit just right. He wore them to practice to show he meant business, dapper in his grey sweat pants and sleek black shoes as he slapped grounders over the dirt infield.</p>
<p>My mother grew up without a television, and when she and my father married, living in a tipi for a year before building a house on the land they purchased in the Rocky Mountain foothills above Troy, they shared a vision of home as a refuge from the outside world. In our living room the couch and the wooden rocking chair faced the piano, an upright in the German style with braces beneath the keyboard, a thick back panel, and a heavy lid made for holding flowers or clocks or lamps for reading sheet music. The hallway on the main floor featured an inset bookcase, which held the Encyclopedia Britannica Great Books collection and my mother’s eclectic library, Chaim Potok’s <em>The Chosen</em>, Graham Greene’s <em>The Wind in the Willows</em>, James Herriot’s <em>All Creatures Great and Small</em>. My father read the newspaper and the Bible and considered most other reading frivolous, rousting me from my bedroom to pull weeds when I lounged there too long with a book.<em> </em>Baseball was the one crack in the fortress, the one out from garden chores, the only excuse for television to invade the protective bubble of faith and homegrown food and music my parents had created for us.</p>
<p>The God I heard about every Sunday and in the chapters my father read before dinner might have considered baseball a rival deity, a golden calf I worshipped every summer on the field and every fall in front of the television set. And there were times when the spitting and crotch scratching cast a frown over my mother’s face. But this was an open door to the world my father allowed, one vestige from his past he did not surrender to the brave new life on the homestead. So I was allowed to worship the game in my own way, plastering the cement walls of my basement bedroom with photographs of Mookie Wilson and Keith Hernandez and Lenny Dykstra clipped from my grandfather’s castoff <em>Sports Illustrated </em>magazines. As I lay on the bear claw quilt my mother had stitched from old corduroy, gazing at the wall mosaic of my heroes with my hands interlocked behind my head, I dreamed of one day making it to The Show. And in a curious way this was not unlike my hope of heaven, though I gave no thought to the irony of a game – a worldly pleasure – sating my yearning for redemption.</p>
<p>Baseball followed Pentecostal doctrine to a surprising degree. Every game, like a church service, began with a song. The true believers, the faithful who had really laid their lives down in support of the team, were not content to sit idly by in the bleachers. When we were down, they hollered encouragement, and when we were up, boy, they banged on the aluminum bleachers and stomped their feet and carried on like they had religion.</p>
<p>One tenet of Pentecostal belief, which followed the doctrine of immediate revelation – the idea that God could speak directly to the individual – was the notion of spiritual gifts. Speaking in tongues was the most dramatic of these, but my father and mother believed there were Christians with the gift of miraculous healing, the gift of interpreting what others were saying in tongues, the gift of prophecy, the gift of teaching, and many others. Every time I scooped a grounder or steadied myself beneath a fly ball, it was only to get one out closer to my next at-bat, when I could dig into the batter’s box and let my true gift shine. “Don’t leave your light under a bushel,” one verse said, and I strove to obey that command every time I lowered myself into my stance. Everywhere else on the field I was a little above average – decent speed, an adequate arm, steady with the glove. At the plate I was unique, often batting above .700 for the regular season, able to launch pitches well beyond the two hundred foot fences. Our preacher described spiritual gifts as a believer’s full inheritance, recounting how he had prayed for the gift of healing, asking God for his full reward. In church I knew I’d come up short. But on the diamond, the sacred ground I shared with my father, I came into that reward.</p>
<p>Baseball is a team effort, but it is just as much an individual discipline, each fielder enisled in his own thoughts, each batter standing alone at the plate. The solitary togetherness of the sport resonated with the stamina I’d gained while sitting through two-hour long revival meetings, the comfort with my own inner space I’d been encouraged to learn through prayer. Reading was also a natural outgrowth of that life, losing myself for hours in another world between the covers of a novel, and writing would later fulfill a similar urge to the reaching out of prayer, the questioning and the crying out and the inner groping for peace. But as a child nothing made more sense than batting, where my father might be watching from the third base line, and my mother and grandparents might be cheering from the stands, but no one else could take my place between the chalk lines of the batter’s box. It was a meditative place where I stood in a half crouch awaiting the pitcher’s delivery, my back elbow cocked to keep my swing level, hands gripping the bat handle without squeezing too much, my whole body coiled and ready. The pitcher faded in my vision, the chatter from the infielders dimmed, and I waited to see the ball in flight, my legs and arms tightening in the split second before deciding to swing.</p>
<p>In practice I took time to think about keeping the bat level, punching an outside pitch to the opposite field, eyes following the ball straight down to the bat. But in the game I played by instinct, the sudden knowledge of whether a pitch was too high or too low or whether it was slicing in straight across the plate, belt high, in my wheelhouse. When that happened, when I felt the pitch arcing toward the sweet spot, my body twisted forward to meet the ball, arms whipping the wooden bat, eyes fixed on the blur of the pitch. There was a power rising within me, a spirit force welling up. This was my gift. This was my full inheritance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a child I felt these things without naming them, buoyed or weighed down by sudden impressions of joy or guilt rising like vapors from the stew of family life. The elation on my face when the clean shock of the sweet spot rippled up my arms into my chest surely appeared to everyone else as little more than a kid having fun, but the feeling resonated with me as proof of God’s favor, though I could not have explained why. Eric Liddell, the pious sprinter in <em>Chariots of Fire</em>, captured the essence of it when he explained to his sister, “God made me for a purpose, but he also made me fast. And when I run I feel his pleasure.”<em> </em>So when the game went badly, when I let a grounder hop between my legs or fisted a pitch into an easy pop fly, a pall fell over my spirits not unlike the nagging fear that my soul was in peril.</p>
<p>The morning after a game, my father would have forgotten the outcome, good or bad, but I had more difficulty letting go and often sat at the breakfast table in a brooding silence. He tried to make me laugh then, cracking jokes about how it took more energy to frown than to smile, but this only pushed me deeper into gloom, and if I sometimes poured too much maple syrup on my pancakes, it was only as a stand-in for my next chance to step up to home plate and make sweet contact once more.</p>
<p>When I launched a home run and circled the bases with the echo of it still tingling in my hands, my father often said, perhaps to curb my pride, “You’re only as good as your next at-bat.” I took this to heart. It was a literalism I was internalizing in church, a way of sorting the world into the clean and the unclean, trusting rituals of penance to make me whole. Like a prayer for forgiveness, which might wash away my sin for that instant alone, every trip to the plate was a mountaintop where I could not linger, an absolution pitching me back into the valley to climb out again. To my shame I can scarcely remember my teammates, so intent I was on claiming the game as my one true gift, sitting alone in a packed dugout with my wooden bat at my side. Sometimes I held it at arm’s length, studying the waves of the wood grain rippling beneath the blue Worth logo, then twisting the handle and closing one eye so I could track the straight lines of the side grain toward the sweet spot in the middle of the barrel, the place where I belonged, where I wanted to live my whole life.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All these greenings and gleanings<br />
in the fields, and her own body moving easily<br />
in and out of the weather. Her parents<br />
still themselves in their glowing home<br />
far away, poised to welcome her.</p>
<p>Sometimes the memory of another house<br />
and the sullen silences that filled it<br />
and the abandoned water tower behind it<br />
where she sneaked away after quarrels<br />
to weep alone, old at thirty.<br />
Now her will sails on, nothing</p>
<p>to impede it, as the men, even the ones<br />
who’ve done the leaving—a lover<br />
damaged by divorce, a lover damaged<br />
by war—shrink far behind.<br />
Even the two horses seem to<br />
linger in their long prime,</p>
<p>the bellied sling of these middle years.<br />
The rhythms of the fields.<br />
Her solid little house.<br />
Some evenings a run in the fading light.<br />
Or dancing, then driving home alone<br />
and happy, sweat drying under the sequins.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mind walks through the house turning off<br />
every lamp but one, leaving<br />
a trail of small relinquishments—</p>
<p>a book turned face-down<br />
at the spot where sleepiness overtook<br />
the little cogs and wheels,</p>
<p>a cup of tea tasted and then forgotten.<br />
What has not been accomplished<br />
lingers as restlessness that braids</p>
<p>itself into Mind’s imperfect<br />
sleep, the cogs and wheels of dreams<br />
and now the house and all the other houses</p>
<p>strung along the seams of the valley are left<br />
to themselves. The words spoken inside them<br />
all day, the air displaced from objects</p>
<p>lifted and set down, and the scents of onion<br />
or lemon oil settle into paper, into cloth,<br />
between grains of polished wood. Each house</p>
<p>breathes on its own now, the sound of<br />
water staying warm in its tank.</p>
<p>The mountain melts into the night, veiled<br />
and uninhabited. An altar. A silence.<br />
The houses melt into the mountain</p>
<p>in that most private hour just before<br />
dawn sets every timber and stone, every<br />
roof, every dish and birdcall back in place.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>In that most private hour, Mind<br />
heats the coffee and, some mornings,<br />
finds itself reading of other lives</p>
<p>as the sun inches towards plums<br />
in a white bowl. The ceramic glaze<br />
of the cup. They could be stones resting</p>
<p>in a clear stream, bathed as they are<br />
in the silence of another kind of morning<br />
absorbed and given purpose:</p>
<p>stones to be shaped and fitted for<br />
the cathedral, bone needles<br />
pulled along seams of rough cloth</p>
<p>as the nuns’ way of listening to their God<br />
and bread broken and passed around,<br />
breaking a fast that once sharpened, as it</p>
<p>sharpens still, the colors and contours<br />
of faith, and savored as though nothing,<br />
at the moment, could be more desired.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pushing the envelope that is his mother<br />
the kangaroo joey rides<br />
his first heartbeats. As does the wombat, wrapped</p>
<p>in darkness, and the cuscus, the sugar glider,<br />
flying possum, dasyure. Wise nature,<br />
to stitch onto even the smallest pouched-mouse</p>
<p>a sleeve in which to hide. My grandmother,<br />
mother of eleven with little to claim<br />
her own, loved pockets so deeply</p>
<p>she fastened them to every apron,<br />
and no hands but hers ever ventured inside.<br />
Pockets! What would we be without you.</p>
<p>Where would the diner waitress tuck<br />
her filled bills, extra straws, the gnawed pencil<br />
adding it all up. And in the ancient</p>
<p>land that was my childhood<br />
and maybe yours, where else to secure<br />
the tackle and trim of the nerds and geeks—</p>
<p>protractors, slide rules, pens and more pens<br />
leaking out answers I was not yet<br />
ready to hear, above the racking clack</p>
<p>of my uncles’ billiards, the break<br />
and spread then the padded gulp of the pocket<br />
taking it all in. Another child,</p>
<p>my husband’s mother, lined her pockets<br />
with stones on her way to school<br />
so her birdlike bones would register sufficiently</p>
<p>on the Great Depression’s official scales.<br />
<em>Pocket</em>: keeper of secrets,<br />
hidden lining. Something to empty</p>
<p>at day’s end. Encoder, ender<br />
of marriages. Someone discovers a phone number,<br />
receipt, a lipstick-smudged handkerchief,</p>
<p>the human stain. <em>Hide</em>: skin<br />
of an animal, tacked to a wall. <em>Go ahead,<br />
spill it out</em>, nods the man with the diploma</p>
<p>nailed above his desk, proferring<br />
a tissue for your tears. Don’t take it,<br />
why should you, why surrender the clenched purse</p>
<p>of your history: the nights you’ve hoarded,<br />
your unspoken prayers, the liturgy<br />
of keys riding the blue-jeaned pocket of a lover,</p>
<p>wearing down year by year<br />
a pocket-sized bald spot on his thigh<br />
for your eyes only, here beside the nightstand</p>
<p>where he spills his keys, matches, wadded<br />
bills, loose change. All day you will wear his scent<br />
in your hair, your closed lips sealing</p>
<p>the contract. Even the smallest nation requires<br />
pockets of resistance, hidden heartbeat,<br />
muted drum. If you never hide,</p>
<p>who will come seeking? Beneath the earth,<br />
in hollows too deep to mine,<br />
alluvial gold. Untapped vein, secret ore.</p>
