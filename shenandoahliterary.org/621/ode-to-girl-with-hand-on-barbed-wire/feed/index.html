					<description><![CDATA[I loved the vivid imagery Jill Widner evoked using clear, identifiable diction. Widner immediately hooks the reader in with her effortless images and thought provoking subject matter. The use of sensory detail in the first paragraph with the wind catching Letty’s hand and her dust-coated lips created a sense of immediacy that really hooked me in. Both Letty and the girl are clearly defined and engaging in this subtle, provocative piece. The landscape and setting of McCook was very well developed and created a striking backdrop.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Christina,
Thank you for giving this little piece such a close reading. I like the episodic in fiction. A moment in time. A day in the life. You may be interested to know that it evolved from notes I took on an exhibition of Dorothea Lange&#039;s photographs of the Yakima Valley where I live and teach. http://depts.washington.edu/labpics/repository/v/depress/lange/8b34383r.jpg.html]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[After I finished reading the first paragraph of this story, I knew that I was going to love the writer’s style. I could immediately picture myself in my own car, arm stuck out the window, feeling both simultaneously propelled and thwarted by the oncoming wind. Widner’s narrative does an excellent job of drawing the reader in immediately; we want to root for Letty and the little girl. The subtle descriptions of the girl’s foster home conditions juxtaposed with Letty’s conflicting and somewhat ambiguous feelings about her own job combine to give the brief story a heavy, yet meaningful tone. One of the strongest elements of Widner’s piece is its ability to provide a fleeting look into the “vague relationship” between Letty and the girl, and also provoke the reader to think about what happens on either side of the narrative. How did Letty end up in this career path? What happens to the little girl and her grubby hand gripping the business card?]]></description>
