					<description><![CDATA[Dawna Kemper uses precise, controlled sentences that move the plot swiftly toward each confrontation. Intermixed within these powerful declarative sentences are vivid descriptions of the foreign officer whose physical body mirrors the sparse setting of the story. Kemper emphasizes the limitations of language in the face of brutality, of action. Language fails to protect from action, as does the translator protagonist. The author effectively utilizes dialogue in order to emphasize the failure of language and of people.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The power of this story derives from its tragedy as well as the vibrant language in the narrative. The author makes effective both of these forces by resisting over-dramatization or over-statement. This method allows lines such as “The foreign officer has a scar like a crescent slicing the back of his skull, as if someone wanted to peer inside” to show as deliberately as the scar itself. These images are grotesque and yet described with a delicacy that provides insight into the narrator. Observations such as “the child’s eyes were enormous” suggest that the translator does not see the child in the ruthless way of his officer; however, he must act the part. In this manner, Kemper’s language mirrors that of the translator’s: with restrained words both speakers must convey an image that cannot entirely be made explicit.]]></description>
