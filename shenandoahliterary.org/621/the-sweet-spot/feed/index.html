					<description><![CDATA[This story is an interesting examination of not just baseball, but the exhilarating feeling when you&#039;re doing something you truly love. Everyone has something they&#039;re passionate about, sports, music, art; something that seems to stop the flow of time and allows you to briefly live in the Present, the now. It ends the constant dialogue in your head about work, school, or any other obligation, and makes you more like an animal, simply alive. The Present is fleeting though. Once you&#039;ve experienced it, all you want to do is return, like the author, to the next at-bat.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The relationship between the author and his father evokes a deep, but difficult, love.  Combining baseball and religion seems odd at first, but the author skillfully weaves the two together in order too create an effect more powerful than the two subjects standing alone.  The images are unique and vivid.  I never felt out of touch with the situation despite my lack of knowledge concerning baseball.  As my own father&#039;s child prodigy, I understand the complexities of a relationship driven by success in a sport.  The author pulls together a moving tale of a father and a son, a boy and his God, and an athlete and his sport.  Well done!]]></description>
