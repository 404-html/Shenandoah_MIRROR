<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/09/Confederado300px.jpeg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-739" title="Confederado300px" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/09/Confederado300px.jpeg" alt="" width="126" height="192" srcset="https://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/09/Confederado300px.jpeg 300w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/09/Confederado300px-196x300.jpeg 196w" sizes="(max-width: 126px) 100vw, 126px" /></a>Casey Clabough’s first novel, <em>Confederado</em>, is the story of Alvis Benjamin Stevens, a confederate soldier of central Virginia who returns home four months after the official conclusion of the American Civil War to find the context of his landscape, family and town, as well as the stability of his memories, irrevocably altered by what the war has wrought upon them. After igniting enmity among a group of union soldiers within town and escaping narrowly via deft horsemanship and the advice of a woodsmen and a wealthy uncle, Alvis comes to understand he will have to leave his wrecked home for Brazil, where Lavinia, the intelligent and beautiful girl he courted before the war, has fled before him.</p>
<p>After accepting the need to abandon a home he can no longer recognize as his own, Alvis travels through raucous weathers and is literally wrecked and deposited upon the sands of Brazil, finding there a world completely alien to him, where, after living with several idiosyncratic locals and engaging in battles equal to and perhaps more harrowing than those he survived in his homeland, he persists, adapts and, ultimately, prevails. In Clabough’s hands, the story proves kinetic, exciting, and perhaps most importantly, textured with a giftedness that makes <em>Confederado</em> more than an adventure tale: It is genuine literature, allowing its reader to live with and within its protagonist. Relying equally on the complex interiorities of Alvis and the exteriorities of diverse landscapes in which the story takes place, <em>Confederado</em> bears resemblance to the best historical fiction of writers such as Robert Morgan and Ron Rash.</p>
<p>This success is due to Clabough’s muscular handling of narrative: the book’s tone is stately, measured, imbued with fecund language and well-executed and historically accurate dialog. The momentum of the story vacillates between pace and gallop (indeed, Clabough’s love of horses, landscape, and farming are made nearly palpable in this novel), but the swiftness of the story’s movement is not episodic; instead, it is cumulative, authentic, creating a work both vast and intimate. Even in the relatively contemplative, languorous moments in the novel, Clabough’s language is more than merely metaphorically taut, but brisk, sonically textured, often achieving the concentrated dynamism of poetry. In the following passage, for example, Alvis’s re-imagines his home’s landscape despite its war-ravaged wildness:</p>
<p>Alvis . . . took long a long circuitous walk about the farm as mottled clouds drifted eastward overhead, filtering in the sunlight of late afternoon. He paused in the midst of his return beneath a great sycamore on a hillside overlooking the surrounding terrain. The whiteness of the house shone in the bottom against the green fields and weathered gray chestnut boards of the outbuildings. The fields had been neglected during the war and stood covered in weeds, sumac, and saplings, but Alvis, recalling all his father had taught him, could imagine how they would appear when he worked them again: how the furrows would open with a dark purple hue in the creek bottom while irregular shades of hard red clay would line the hillsides.</p>
<p>Alvis’s love of trees transcends their utility, the narrator tells us; his admiration includes, also, “the manner by which they spoke of the seasons through the shifting colors of leaves and the rushing and receding of sap.”</p>
<p>Indeed, all of <em>Confederado</em> is about revising one’s life, changing one’s inner and outer landscape to survive inevitable obstacles, even death. It is about indentifying home and acknowledging its changeability, how to adapt to and reshape it, while never losing sight of one’s central goal. Thus, despite its tragic landscapes and characters, <em>Confederado</em> is a heroic tale, one worth reading more than once for its muscular, authentic, and exciting textures.</p>

<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/08/bringup.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-647" title="bringup" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/08/bringup.jpeg" alt="" width="132" height="198" /></a>If you love the Tudors, you will probably like Hilary Mantel’s <em>Bring up the Bodies</em>. The sequel to her <em>Wolf Hall</em>, the book continues the story of Henry VIII’s secretary Thomas Cromwell. Mantel now focuses on the fall of Anne Boleyn, and though this story is well known, she hopes to make it new by using Cromwell as her main character.</p>
<p>Mantel has been criticized before for disregarding period diction in her historical novels, especially in her dialogue, and the writing in <em>Bring up the Bodies </em>is no exception. Although she sprinkles in a few Renaissancey-sounding terms like “kinsman” and “napery,” the writing, for the most part, uses the same expressions and locutions that she used in <em>A Place of Greater Safety</em>, her novel about the French Revolution. The language in all these novels is not much different than what you would expect to find in a contemporary work of fiction. Characters refer to liquidating assets; someone’s time at court is called a “tour of duty.” Sometimes, too, her metaphors get a little out of control, as when an ambassador “fizzes across the room.”</p>
<p>But the quirk that is likely to annoy most readers is the constant clarification of pronouns that refer to Cromwell. The novel is written in third-person limited point of view, and novelists using this perspective usually use the main character’s proper name when necessary. Mantel, however, has adopted the habit of using both pronoun and proper name, as in “He, Cromwell, sees Chapuys” or “he, Cromwell, was trying to break down Thomas More.” It’s frequent and distracting. Worse, it’s usually unnecessary, and in a writer as skilled as Hilary Mantel, it’s also baffling.</p>
<p>All that acknowledged, why did I tear through this four-hundred-plus page novel in half a day? I’m fascinated by the Tudor period, for one, but the writing is also compelling. Cromwell, who is often characterized as monstrous and unfeeling, reveals, in Mantel’s hands, how easily contradictions between religious belief and political action sit in the human mind, and descriptions like this, that use sustained metaphor beautifully, kept me reading:</p>
<p>[Anne Boleyn] orders her women out: a vehement gesture, a child scaring crows.  Unhurried, like bold corvines of some new and silky kind, the ladies gather their trains, flap languidly away; their voices like voices from the air, trail behind them: their gossip broken off, their knowing cackles of laughter. Lady Rochford is the last to take wing, trailing her feathers, reluctant to yield the ground (106).</p>
<p>The passages featuring Anne are, for me, the strongest in the book. From her early appearance, with her “dark glitter, now rubbed a little, flaking in places” (36) to her death, when her “flat little presence” on the scaffold “becomes a puddle of gore,” Anne Boleyn is, despite the presence of Cromwell, the dramatic center of this story.</p>
<p>Don’t read <em>Bring up the Bodies </em>for its plot. If you are interested enough in Tudor England to have picked it up, you already know what’s going to happen. There is no suspense, and there are no unexpected twists or turns. Read the book if you want original character study and insight into the complex, often violent, events that governed Europe during the Renaissance. The Tudors still loom large in the Western imagination, and Hilary Mantel has made good use of that continued fascination.</p>
<p>P.S. Stay away from <em>Secrets of the Tudor Court</em>, which tells the story of Mary Howard, Anne Boleyn’s cousin. The novelized account of this poor woman’s life makes such frequent use of popular psychology (such as “cycles of violence” and “projection”) that it is almost unreadable. There are no “secrets” revealed, except, possibly, that Mary Howard was even more insipid and stupid than we feared.</p>

<p>2012 must be a banner year for Nathan Englander. He has (at long last) come out with his second collection of short stories titled What We Talk About When We Talk About Anne Frank, he teamed up with Jonathan Safran Foer to release a new Haggadah, and his first play, “The Twenty-Seventh Man,” will be produced in November. The play was originally the first short story in Englander’s remarkable debut collection, <em>For the Relief of Unbearable Urges</em>, published in 1999. Most of the collection focuses on post-World War Two orthodox Jewish Americans who carefully (or in some cases recklessly) calculate identity as they maneuver the strict ethics and laws of the Judaic condition. Other stories, especially “The Tumblers,” set during the Holocaust, challenge readers with darkly twisted humor in the most desolate other-worldly circumstances. The elegance of this particular story provokes wonder; how does Englander encase hideous history within writing that seems fitting for wonderland fables? Englander continues through the rest of the collection to display this deft ability to juggle apparently mismatched tones and subjects with poise.  “Reb Kringle” is about an unfortunate rabbi forced to make extra money by dressing up as Santa Claus during the holiday season, until he finds a Jewish boy sitting on his lap. The title story shadows a desperate man who seeks remedy from his rabbi. His wife has discontinued intimacy, so the rabbi presents him a most jarring proposition to alleviate his itch, and the acceptance of the resolution proves to be more unbearable than relieving. At times his absurd exaggerations, such as in “The Gilgul of Park Avenue,” make the comical aspects redundant and tiring. “The Twenty-Seventh Man,” however, is sublimely, but sickeningly, the impeccable combination of haunting and hilarious. In this tale inspired by Stalin’s “Night of the Murdered Poets,” twenty-six Jewish Russian literary giants are gathered in cells, the last to join them in their final days is an unknown twenty-seventh man, a so-called fool. Those readers who have even the slightest devotion to freedom of expression may find themselves laughing through tears.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/06/coldest.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-651" title="coldest" alt="" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/06/coldest.jpeg" width="108" height="160" /></a>Coal Black Horse</em> and <em>Far Bright Star</em> convinced me that Robert Olmstead can write as well as anyone around about the solitude, the boredom, the hellish waiting and the sheer horror that beset men at war, about to go to war and trying to recover from war.  He also has few rivals when it comes to writing about horses and men.  At his best he invites comparison to Hemingway, Crane and McCarthy, and in much of <em>The Coldest Night</em> he is at his best.  Olmstead writes of violence and its impact as few American writers today do, with a moral compass which directs timing, detail, duration and context, always in the service of reminding us that violence is not a flashy bouquet to flourish for the pleasure of the nearly-unshockable, nearly-insatiable contemporary audience.  Like Yeats, he knows that something terrible can be beautiful, but it is no less terrible for that.</p>
<p>In brief: <em>The Coldest Night</em>&#8216;s Henry Childs is a sensitive but strong West Virginia adolescent who falls in love with Mercy, a girl above his station in life.  In Part 1, the teenagers tease and tryst and abscond together, but paternal power eventually catches up to them and metes out punishment.  In Part II, Henry and his fellow Marine, the wise-cracking Lew Devine, march and crouch, scamper and flinch, kill and pity, learning all the steps in the dance of death as it is performed in the Chosin Reservoir.  Part III: though wounded and damaged, Henry returns to Charleston and strives to recover, but he is stamped with blood to his core, and his experiences dominate his waking and dreaming life.</p>
<p>What I love about this book is its engagement with the environment &#8212; natural, man-made or just hellish.  Olmstead is one of our great observers and listeners &#8212; &#8220;Beyond them in the darkness came a whippoorwill&#8217;s call and then the banging sound of a train taking up slack.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chapter 14 begins to describe the American forces&#8217; movement toward combat: &#8220;It was the Korean autumn when the division marched north through the dusty barren countryside, marched up through the rice fields and apple orchards.  It was the shineless autumn sky in the season of mortality and turning into winter as they marched north along the east coast highway through the tiny villages.  The fruit trees were leafless and stripped bare of their fruit and some were split and shivved and splintered with bullets and their upturned roots exploded from below the ground in broken claws.&#8221;  Almost Hemingway, or James Jones, but Olmstead boldly lets the sentences march on with no impediment, as the precision of his observation creates the clarity.</p>
<p>The book&#8217;s significant disappointment, at least for my taste, lies in its final dozen pages and its opening section.  Although Henry&#8217;s mother and grandfather are captivating characters, and the boy&#8217;s thoughts and actions concerning a particular horse are appealing, the love story in Part I wears thin quickly.  However engaging Henry is in other matters, his take on romance (along with the narrator&#8217;s) veers too closely to the conventions and language of the Romance genre for me, too much theatrical moonlight and sighing.  The quick transformation from puppy love to usually-euphemistic sex scenes (binges, really) is too predictable, and the star-crossed lovers of section I seem more callow than their famous antecedents, and without the Shakespearean language.</p>
<p>I understand that Olmstead is creating a counterpointing architecture for the book, and perhaps the love story must be hyperbolic and Henry must attract our sympathies (even if Mercy is too fey and scatty to earn them), and Henry must also be heart-broken and desperate by the end of the first act.  But Henry is much more alive and interesting when he&#8217;s thinking about something else, with memories of Mercy just coloring the present, than when she&#8217;s physically present.</p>
<p>That said, the story of brotherhood under arms, of how modern warfare creates a wasteland whose survival hardly seems worth the anguish, of growth and the making of a man in a crucible designed to dehumanize all &#8212; that story is rendered here with Olmstead&#8217;s signature command of language and empathy.  Weather, landscape, the movements of adversaries and how they register and are turned in the mind of a man who wants to understand and take responsibility for his own acts and thoughts &#8212; Olmstead manages these as well as anyone, and no one could fault him for lack of ingenuity or heart.</p>

<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/06/FinalAndrea-Nightwoods-Review.mp3">Nightwoods Review</a></p>
<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/06/nightwoods.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-649" title="nightwoods" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/06/nightwoods.jpeg" alt="" width="107" height="160" /></a>The lean, taut narrative of <em>Nightwoods</em> creates a story in which the setting holds as much spark as the characters, and is the central factor that brings forth the theme of the overwhelming power of nature. Charles Frazier writes about a young woman, Luce, who renounces the perils of civilization in favor of the raw beauty of the mountainous Appalachian South. In her self-exile, Luce attempts to find solace in the quiet mother the woods provides, but instead has to uphold the natural responsibility of taking care of her sister’s twin son and daughter after she is murdered by her husband, Bud. Unwittingly, Luce kindles a gradual maternal love for these children, and attempts to offer them security from their belligerent father while teaching them to tame their primal proclivity for fire. In this novel, Frazier offers depictions of various manifestations of nature—fire, the woods, the mountains—in such a way that underlines the bonds and emotions expressed by the characters. Though at times edging on the melodramatic, Frazier’s writing ultimately conveys the timeless message of survival and endurance.</p>
<p>Luce’s name speaks to her character, as <em>lucere</em> in Latin means “to shine.” Rather than allow her rape to smother her, she takes to the woods where her light becomes radiant. She embraces this secluded environment as preferable to the ugliness she had experienced at the hands of “civilized” mankind, for she considers “life” to have gotten “in the way” of nature. Her love for the wild becomes clear and is exemplified when she chooses to burn her canoe—her vehicle to society that made “town…only twenty minutes away.” She chooses to be an outsider and enjoys her removed existence. When she becomes caretaker to her niece and nephew, she recognizes the primitive, wild natures of these “tiny cavemen.” They are silent and communicate their angst through the physical act of destruction, markedly in setting things on fire. Yet, she is able “to shine” for these children and thus tame their rawness. Luce develops a love for them born of responsibility, a commitment stemming from her belief that “you take care of whatever needy things present themselves to you during your passage through [the world]. Otherwise you’re worthless.” With her love, she demonstrates to the twins that fire can be curbed to be warming, lapping flames of positive emotion.</p>
<p>Fire resurfaces throughout the novel as a metaphor for passionate emotion. Just as fire can be destructive when rampant and useful when controlled, too much passion can lead to vicious sentiment. Bud, the central antagonist of the novel, exemplifies this notion, as he justifies his flaming violence for its “spur-of-the-moment…purity.” After killing his wife, he passionately seeks to find the money he’s convinced she’s hidden. It is this drive that brings him to target his children. His desire utterly consumes him and can potentially consume all in his path, leaving devastation in his wake. The tempered love Luce exhibits works to stem this, in order to provide protection for her charges.</p>
<p>In essence, this is a violent story made palatable by Frazier’s measured and evocative prose. Though this characteristic of the novel actually interrupts any immediate pull to draw readers in, it provides a quiet strength akin to Luce’s that proves to be quite compelling. This is beautifully evidenced in the diction of the following descriptive passage where Luce reflects upon nature as an overwhelming force:<br />
&#8220;The black hole [of nature] was before life and beyond life. If you dipped a ladle of that water and drank it, visions would come so dark you wouldn&#8217;t want to live in the world that contained them. You&#8217;d be ready to flee toward the other darkness summed up in death, which is only distant kin to the black hole and the liquid it cups.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frazier fluidly guides the reader through <em>Nightwoods</em>, bolstering the inherent tension of his plotline through this understated style of writing.</p>
<p>Nature in its many guises becomes so important to this novel due to Frazier’s lush depictions, which indicate his profound knowledge of the region. He is able to manipulate natural elements and artfully integrate them into his story, implementing them as undercurrents to character interactions and relationships. In one of his many descriptions of setting, Frazier entwines fire and flora as, &#8220;poplars were already half bare and long grasses drooped burnt from the first frost. Bands of lavender and state clouds moving against a metallic sky, denoting the passage of autumn. Fallen leaves blown on the porch.&#8221; Though these passages add texture to his novel, there were perhaps so many of them that Frazier’s focus veered from adding depth to his plotline. For instance, in their shadow Bud began to seem like a caricature supervillain by the end of the novel, given no character depth aside from his bloodthirst.</p>
<p>The core value of <em>Nightwoods</em> lies in this novel’s superior construction. Frazier’s frequent use of fiery diction and imagery burns the book’s theme into readers’ minds, and adds to the notion of nature as an overwhelming force. Yet, perhaps the novel focuses too much on displaying Frazier’s writing toolbox rather than the core story, which was predictable at best. This can be easily forgiven, however, by relishing the descriptions Frazier offers of the Appalachian South of the late 1950’s. The enduring quality of nature is thus injected into the text, allowing <em>Nightwoods</em> to attain lasting literary worth.</p>

<p>I almost bought a copy of <em>Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter</em> a couple of weeks ago, but I already had a copy of <em>TLC</em>, so widely praised (a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller, starred reviews in <em>Library Journal</em> and <em>Booklist</em>), and I figured I should work further into my “to read” list and not add to it something from the current undead mania and likely to irritate and frustrate me. Do I need to say here that “entertainment” isn’t an accurate description of the ore I’m mining for when I do my “leisure reading”?<span>  </span>Snobby, I reckon, but by no means am I immune to the skillful thriller or sprawling excess of a historical novel, though I like to know what wood I’ve entered as I begin the trek. <em>TLC</em> was advertised at “Huck Finn channeled through <em>Lord of the Flies”</em> (so saith <em>The Washington Post</em>), and that appealed to me, though I eventually concluded it was more like <em>Tom Sawyer</em> meets “The Ransom of Red Chief,” with a strong dose of Stephen King. But “more matter and less art,” right? Here’s my beef.</p>
<p>How to distinguish between “plot driven” and “character driven”? In the latter, the most significant revelations are about what this or that character IS, who he/she IS. The enterprise runs even deeper than “motive” or what (God help us) profilers discover. The real investigation I’m drawn to is the nature of human nature. Certainly what the character DOES is crucial; if Huck decided he should help Jim but just dilly-dallied and lollygagged but didn’t act, well, road to hell paved over again. But it’s that process of learning about the rapacious and unfair side of the human animal that makes Huck question himself and the conventions of his community. (He doesn’t actually have to GO to hell for right reason and action; but he has to be willing.)</p>
<p>And <em>TLC</em> is rife with characters – the obsessed rogue detective, the obsessed aberrant boy, the missing angel child, the irresponsibly drugged-out mother, the twisted cop, the abusive and arrogant rich guy, the weak sidekick, the good-hearted but dull African-American giant, pedophiles and pervs of all stripes. If you want types, Hart (who names his detective co-hero “Hunt”) supplies them with commendable generosity.</p>
<p>And the good thing about types is that their actions can be shaped and(even more important in a mystery) timed to fit the outline.Every character is built upon two or three vectors, so they will sit and fetch and beg on command. So these two irritants come together: Reader really knows all about these people a quarter of the way through the book; Reader sees their calendars dovetailing perfectly to fit the outline.<span>  </span>When a girl is abducted exactly one year after another missing child incident (which turns out not to have been an abduction), her vanishing and re-emergence trigger a manhunt which discloses many remains, mostly children (too much <em>CSI</em>, etc!). Coincidences run amok.<span>  </span>Boys in danger and dangerous villains and rambling cops all seem to be listening to a higher power which frequently says “converge here now.”</p>
<p>I’m going into overtime myself. Quickly, two other disappointments. First, the author employs shifts in point of view for expediency and not dramatic or structural necessity, and he seems to have no strategy, no overall shape in mind. Second, sometimes the writing is dreadful. Hart can turn a phrase when he wants to, but those sequences of one-word sentences (and one-word paragraphs) meant to intensify and deepen really seem a little silly, though Stephen King seems to have transcended silly in the minds of many, despite his addiction to the flung single syllable. Here’s an example, unfair because it’s one of the worst, but I’m in my closing argument: “Disgust was an organ in Hunt’s gut.” Come again? No, never mind.</p>
<p>So why are the blood and the twisted nature of the story leading newspapers (yeah, I know) to say <em>TLC</em> “Rises to serious literature”? My guess is that the bar has been set so low by the series novels and splatterfest films that a book which suggests that the monsters are among us down in eastern N.C. (despite the lack of dialect markers and idiom, genuine regional lore or the resonance of a real culture) is a clean change of shirts. You’ve heard of made-for-TV movies; this is a made-for-TV book, except that it seems already from TV, though maybe that’s the point.</p>
<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/06/vampire-hunter.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-469" title="vampire hunter" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/06/vampire-hunter.jpeg" alt="" width="171" height="253" /></a>[Coda: In case anyone&#8217;s dying to know, I did eventually read Seth Grahame-Smith&#8217;s <em>Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter</em> and found it an even mix of entertainment and annoyance. Coincidence and obfuscation (especially pertaining to what powers vampires have and how a man with an axe can be quick enough and strong enough to defeat them in combat) interfere with any scrupulous attempt to willingly suspend disbelief. Twain&#8217;s hilarious &#8220;Fenimore Cooper&#8217;s Literary Offenses&#8221; provides a useful litmus for both the plotting and the style of the novel, and one wonders why the author chose to fabricate journals by Abraham Lincoln for this face-paced confection. Lincoln is one of the most distinctive prose stylists in American literature, but the style of these &#8220;extracts&#8221; is hysterical with exclamation marks, often flaccid and almost devoid of Lincoln&#8217;s signature rhetorical architecture. It&#8217;s all too much <em>Dark Shadows</em> and not enough Bram Stoker. As for the highly-touted research behind the book, most of the history can, in fact, be gleaned from Wikipedia, and Grahame-Smith manufactures fictoids like an affair between John Wilkes Booth and Mary Surratt to no evident purpose. A writer at <em>Vanity Fair</em> called ALVH &#8220;the funniest, most action-packed, and weirdly well-researched account of the Civil War you&#8217;ll probably read in a long time. . . ,&#8221; but the firing on Fort Sumter occurs with the book nearly 80% done. Did anyone who blurbed the book read the whole thing? I won&#8217;t say I regret spending an afternoon on it, and the cleverness is undeniable, while the book&#8217;s fundamental concept is wild and weird and might have made for a fine short story in the horror genre. It&#8217;s perhaps worth saying that Grahame-Smith also wrote the screenplay to the wild and delightful film version that not only omits most of the story but adds some delicious touches of its own, and the visual spectacle of stampede, vampire ball, and trestle conflagration made that matinee a fine one, indeed.]</p>
