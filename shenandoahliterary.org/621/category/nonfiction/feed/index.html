<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>            </span>I’m eating rice krispies when my mother asks me whether I’d like to go to church camp. She pours corn flakes for my little sister and douses them with milk.<span>  </span>It’s March and snow is piled on the window sill.<span>  </span>Frost has tooled lace on the glass.<span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>“When?” I ask.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>“Next summer.” </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>Next summer seems like an eternity away.<span>  </span>First comes Easter, then my birthday in May, then summer.<span>  </span>My brother is swinging his legs under the table.<span>  </span>He kicks me accidentally and I kick him back.<span>  </span>So he kicks me on purpose and I kick him back hard. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>“Kids from lots of different churches will be there.<span>  </span>It lasts for a week.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span><span>  </span>My brother pokes me on the shoulder and I punch him on the arm.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>“Stop it, you two,” Mother orders.<span>  </span>Then she pulls out a chair and sits down with her bowl of Wheaties.<span>  </span>“Why don’t you think about it for a while,” she suggests shrewdly.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>I had never been separated from my parents over night.<span>  </span>But c</span>hurch camp offered the fabulous and real possibility of life without my brother and sister and without my parents.<span>   </span>No one would force me to pick the peas, or eat my slimy kohlrabi, or dry the ugly dishes, or go to bed while it was still light.<span>  </span>Six whole days of freedom stretched before me like a veritable midway of circus rides.<span>  </span>I could swim whenever I wanted, including after lunch.<span>  </span>My reading reveries wouldn’t be interrupted by my mother telling me to go outside and get fresh air.<span>  </span>I could get by eating nothing but cookies, and stay up all night.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>  </span><span>          </span>The Monday I set out for camp, my mother had to leave for work at seven.<span>   </span>I was already up and dressed.<span>  </span>I sat on my parents’ bed watching her pull on her white nylons and adjust the seams.<span>  </span>She powdered her chest above her bra and stepped into her nurse’s uniform. My father handed her the lunch he had packed for her and then we walked behind her to the car.<span>  </span>Her nylons made a reassuring whishing sound as she walked, but when she turned around to say goodbye, her face registered inclement weather.<span>  </span>She hugged me for several seconds longer than normal, then got into the car and twisted the key in the ignition.<span>  </span>The starter motor turned over, but she idled in the driveway, rolled down the window, stuck her head out, and said, <em>Don’t forget your sweater</em>.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">She backed the car a few feet, then stopped.<span>  </span><em>Give her a little money</em>, she said to my father.<span>  </span>He pulled out his wallet and handed me two dollars.<span>   </span><em>You’ll be okay, </em>she told me, flicking her head quickly.<span>  </span>Then she hastily backed out.<span>  </span>I felt delighted that she was going to miss me.<span>  </span>It gave me a sense of power.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">My father helped me fold and pack my Sunday dresses in our tan suitcase because I wanted to look cool at camp.<span>  </span>He had a heart condition, as my parents called it, which is why he’d sold his general store in Parkers Prairie, Minnesota and moved us to Lincoln, Nebraska, where my mother could get work.<span>  </span>In our new city he cheerfully scouted stores and vegetable markets for the family groceries, tended us kids, and sewed small cheesecloth bags of herbs for his savory vegetable soup.<span>  </span>That fall he had poured his energy into helping to establish The Lincoln Christian School in a church basement.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As I watched my princely sandy-haired father latch the suitcase with his freckled hands and buckle a belt around it, I began to feel slightly queasy.<span>  </span>I walked downstairs, carefully gripping the hand rail.<span>  </span>I stood beside my favorite spot in our back yard by the tiger lilies.<span>  </span>Closing my eyes, I tried to recover the reckless pleasure of being without any parents for a week, but I felt seasick, as if I were standing in a violently rocking rowboat.<span>  </span>The waves, pulling me farther from the shore, were not about to stop.<span>  </span>I was going to camp.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">A tenuous bunch of authorities ruled over us campers.<span>  </span>There was a director named Pastor Ray, who looked slightly goofy in his tight rayon shirt and brown pants.<span>  </span>A few parental volunteers stood around Pastor Ray, and a squadron of gangly kids worked behind folding tables.<span>  </span>They looked about the age of the high-schoolers I knew from church.<span>  </span>We were standing around a clearing in the woods.<span>   </span>Cabins were scattered around the edge, in the trees.<span>  </span>Above their doors, on posters, fat, cloud-shaped magic marker letters spelled out:<span>  </span><em>The Purple Dragons, The Holy Ghosts,</em> and <em>Nancy’s Storm Troopers.</em><span>  </span>One was called <em>Cabin Six.</em><span>  </span>I didn’t want to be assigned to Cabin Six, which I believed must have something wrong with it.<span>    </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Our counselors shoved one another, hooting and laughing as they checked off our names, allotted us sheets and pillows, and handed us our schedules,.<span>  </span>They ebbed and flowed like water, losing track of us briefly, retreating, whispering, buzzing, swarming in a group, then remembering their jobs, returning to their posts.<span>   </span>I didn’t know anyone except Audrey Jones, the friend of our family who had driven me to camp with her daughter, Marilyn.<span>  </span>She was talking with the other parent-volunteers.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Other campers went off with their friends, laughing and gabbing, holding their assignment sheets.<span>    </span>I was on my own, literally struck dumb by the high-jinks of the counselors.<span>  </span>I didn’t know which line to stand in and I was too shy to ask.<span>  </span>Hoping I was right, I added myself to the longest line.<span>  </span>When I got to the front, I faced a tousle-haired high school boy.<span>  </span>“Uh, I’m here for camp,” was my brilliant opening.<span>  </span>My words sounded far away and disconnected from me, like the voice of a ventriloquist.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Accepting the schedule and my cabin assignment and the whole unwieldy welcome packet, I juggled everything with my suitcase to the edge of the clearing where I stopped and put it all down in the brown pine needles.<span>  </span>Then I stooped over and picked up the documents one at a time.<span>  </span>I examined each, looking for some code explaining what I should do next.<span>  </span>Surreptitiously I watched other campers, trying to guess what the other girls were doing.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Many of them were rushing gracefully into one another’s arms, or screaming together with laughter as they crossed the clearing in small gangs.<span>  </span>That day, and truthfully every day after that, I watched with stupefied bewilderment as the other girls performed simple actions such as introducing themselves, or telling jokes, or playing volleyball, or testifying.<span>  </span>Many of them did these things with such elegance that I believed I had stumbled into a camp where everyone except me was destined to become Miss America.<span>     </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The camp schedule started with reveille, ran through breakfast, hymn sing, Bible study, lunch, quiet time, sports, crafts, free time, dinner, revival meeting, and campfire.<span>   </span>It ended with taps.<span>  </span>I didn’t know what any of these things were.<span>  </span>I discovered the next day.<span>   </span>Later I realized the schedule was something Pastor Ray could show our parents if they had any questions.<span>  </span>In practice, the drumbeat of the schedule turned out to be more irregular than it appeared on paper.<span>  </span>Above it I could always hear the soaring descant, the melody, the troubled, throbbing, torrid libretto of our counselors’ personal lives.<span><span> </span><span>  </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>I spotted the necklace on Monday afternoon, after unpacking my suitcase in my cabin.<span>   </span>I still remember that moment vividly, in the present tense.<span>   </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>Walking around the tables in the camp canteen, I see a small box holding a greenish plastic cross.<span>  </span></span>It’s about the width of a table knife and the height of a Popsicle stick, and it is affixed to a rawhide string.<span>  </span>I stand at the display table staring at it, keeping myself very still.<span>  </span>I can feel my heart beat in my wrists, which dangle at my sides.<span>  </span>In the stifling Nebraska summer afternoon, a trickle of sweat runs down my stomach.<span>  </span>I cannot believe how beautiful the cross is.<span>  </span>A little placard explains that it glows in the dark.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Glancing significantly at the grownup tending the cash register, so he understands that I am not stealing, I remove the cross from its box.<span>  </span>I stoop and thrust it into the shadows under the table.<span>  </span>It emits a minty light, which is entirely inexplicable, since the necklace doesn’t contain any light bulb or battery.<span>  </span>Shining beneath the table, it appears to be cutting into the darkness with its clear edges.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Mist clouds my eyes.<span>  </span>I want this cross the way a person wants health.<span>  </span>At Temple Baptist Church, where my family belongs, we believe it’s wrong to keep images.<span>  </span>Our sanctuary contains pews, facing a plain oak communion table and a podium.<span>  </span>We don’t keep religious symbols in our houses, either.<span>  </span>So I have never held a crucifix or looked at one carefully.<span>   </span>My aching love for this simple fluorescent cross in the palm of my hand is as astonishing as it is powerful and I haven’t the faintest idea at the time that my attraction to it is the first step of a journey that will lead me to a radical separation from my mother.<span>  </span>My problem at the moment is that the cross costs two dollars, and two dollars is the entire amount wadded up in the small red plastic coin purse back in my cabin, the amount my father handed me just before I got into Audrey Jones’ car yesterday and drove away from him.<span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">During weeks of dreaming about being at camp, I imagined buying soft drinks and cookies during breaks, wandering nonchalantly through the canteen with my hands in my pockets perusing the items carefully, weighing alternatives.<span>  </span>It feels lovely now, the possibility of putting my hand out to touch something, knowing that I could either choose that or move on to something else, knowing that I can touch something entirely different tomorrow and it will be mine too.<span>   </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I planned not to spend any of the two dollars on the first day.<span>  </span>I just looked.<span>  </span>What I had left was enough to buy something in the morning and in the afternoon every day for the rest of the week.<span>  </span>If I gave the man at the cash register my whole two dollars I would have to stop coming to the canteen, because I couldn’t bear seeing the crafts and candy and soda pop and books and book marks and plaques without being able to buy something.<span>      </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">So I made my feet walk out of the canteen past the cross, into the brilliant sunshine.<span>  </span>My feet felt sweaty in my tennis shoes. They didn’t want to leave.<span>  </span>Lifting them was as hard for me as lifting the heavy flatiron at my grandmother’s house in Pipestone, Minnesota, the one she set on the wood stove so it would heat up and she could press her dresses.<span>    </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>It’s Wednesday, after lunch.<span>  </span>I’ve gotten through two days and we are all hidden away from the consuming heat, resting on our bunks in our cool, dark cabin.<span>   </span>We can hear the sighing of the pines outside and a little breeze blows through the screened windows.<span>  </span>Our counselor, Nancy, checks the door to make sure no one is eavesdropping, then motions us campers to gather on the bunks around hers.<span>  </span>She confides in her hoarse, sensual voice, that the Lord is leading her toward John.<span>  </span>John has big shoulders and a beard.<span>  </span>He buries the camp garbage and builds the bonfires.<span>  </span>Just yesterday I saw John holding hands with Maureen.<span>  </span>I am astonished.<span>   </span>Does Nancy really think that God wants John to break Maureen’s heart?<span>   </span>My parents are intensely loyal to one another and it is just beginning to occur to me that people actually jilt and get jilted.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">As a mosquito buzzes in the humid early afternoon air, we sit, hushed.<span>  </span>I am stunned by the magnitude of Nancy’s confidence in us, waiting for her to unburden herself further. Nancy fishes in her purse and draws out a new lipstick.<span>  </span>She breaks the seal and screws out its tongue.<span>  </span>Then she passes it around, permitting us to test it on one another’s lips.<span>  </span>I am puzzled because I have been taught that wearing makeup leads to false pride.<span>   </span>It seems peculiar to me that a counselor at Bible Camp is pushing lipstick, but I’ve never held a tube of lipstick, and when I get my hands on it I feel a joyful flutter in my stomach.<span>   </span>I pass it to the girl on my left.<span>  </span>Before we resume Quiet Time, Nancy makes us hold up both hands, palms out, and swear to secrecy.<span>  </span>She plans to put a frog in John’s bed tonight.<span>   </span>As an afterthought she makes us swear that we will not get into mischief while she is busy with the frog.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>            </span>The amount of time our camp counselors spent climbing around in the Alps of teenage love damaged their judgment.<span>  </span>Maureen soon realized that Nancy’s objective was to gain the attention of Maureen’s boyfriend.<span>  </span>Under Maureen’s direction, her girls bolted our cabin door from the outside.<span>  </span>When a brown haired girl named Lavinia, who was the only camper quieter than I was, got up in the night to go to the bathroom, she couldn’t open the door.<span>  </span>I awoke to bumping and whispers.<span>  </span>Lavinia was wiping the floor with her pajama top.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">In our morning Bible study the counselors took turns giving testimonies about the Beatitudes, blessed are the meek, blessed are the poor in spirit, but cabin loyalty led to a system of tribal vengeance.<span>  </span>Nancy organized us.<span>  </span>During the revival service one evening, we propped a plastic pitcher filled with pancake syrup on Maureen’s cabin door so it would fall on whoever opened it first.<span>  </span>We threw sheets over our heads at midnight and waited for Maureen’s girls.<span>  </span>We hovered in silence among the ghostly trees by the dark, spooky path to the bathroom, not far from a massive stone we believed marked a grave.<span>  </span>One of the girls whispered to me that it denoted the place a former camper was buried, a camper, I thought, who might have been caught in the gears of heartbreak and revenge.<span>  </span>Trotting down the path to the bathroom, passing that stone, I could feel terror welling in my chest like a sparkly fountain, creating a romantic thrill that I now realize I must have nurtured, sometimes taking that path just so I could feel it again.<span>    </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Other pranks shocked me because they hovered outside the world I understood as civilized, which at that time meant the world of my family and our school.<span>  </span>One afternoon a counselor named Nate swam underwater, seizing and biting the leg of one of the fat, unpopular boys.<span>  </span>The boy, who thought he had been attacked by a shark, shrieked, and bounded out of the water.<span>  </span>He balled up his fists and screamed for a long time.<span>  </span>Everyone laughed.<span>  </span>It was supposed to be funny, so I laughed, but he never went swimming again.<span>  </span>Watching him sweat on the shore as we swam one day, I felt so sad for him that I didn’t get into the water myself.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Then some kids ran one camper’s pajamas up the flagpole so he had to sleep naked.<span>  </span>They stole and hid the silverware from the dining hall.<span>   </span>In our cabin, Nancy paged through <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Seventeen</span> magazine while we raced around and threw Rice Krispies at one another.<span>  </span>She painted our toenails the red of brake-lights.<span>  </span>She advised us about which boys she thought were cute and hinted at the sultry mysteries of sex.<span>  </span>I was so inexperienced that much of the time I was reduced to the status of a silent observer who was learning the jokes and gambits of an alien tribe. Meanwhile, the camp director sat in his shirtsleeves in the office, fanning himself and talking on the black telephone.<span>       </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>I was probably the smallest child at camp, and I had no inkling of the awakening that would befall me in a year or two.<span>  </span>For me the curtain hadn’t opened on the opera of adolescence.<span>  </span>I didn’t even know there <em>was</em> an opera.<span>  </span>Not that I wasn’t passionate.<span>  </span>That summer I lustily sang four part harmony:<span>  </span><em><span> </span>I’ve got a home in glory land that outshines the sun.<span>  </span>I’ve got a home in glory land that outshines the sun.<span>  </span>Do Lord, oh do Lord, oh do remember me, way beyond the blue.</em><span>  </span>They were the songs of my mother’s fundamentalist people, earthy and rowdy and I loved them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Then there were the lyrics that actually were love songs, though I didn’t yet comprehend that.<span>  </span><em>I come to the garden alone, when the dew is still on the roses and the voice I hear singing in my ear no other sound discloses.<span>  </span>And I walk with him and I talk with him and I tell him I am his own.<span>  </span>And the joy we share as we linger there, none other has ever known.<span>  </span></em><span> </span>I warbled the words with a reverent urgency that I didn’t comprehend as sexuality.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">And chow.<span>  </span>I adored chow:<span>  </span>fried chicken and mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, tapioca pudding, creamed cauliflower, all of it overcooked.<span>  </span>And cookies galore.<span>  </span>No one was making me eat carrots or liver.<span>  </span>We campers stood on the grass in a snaky line, breathing in the earthy aroma of baking bread, singing <em>Here we sit like birds in the wilderness, birds in the wilderness, waiting to be fed,</em> until the cooks opened the wide doors and we could heap our plates with white, starchy, abundant food unlike what my mother made at home.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">At night we huddled in a circle, mesmerized as the bonfire licked the sky with its yellow and red tongues.<span>  </span>I felt like a Neanderthal child:<span>   </span>close, folded into her tribe, safe against the enormous, feeling dark.<span>  </span>But during the day I walked around camp on the edge of tears, overwhelmed by the terrible facts I was discovering about the world.<span>  </span>Naïve as I was, I could feel the undercurrent of pulsing adolescent sexuality.<span>  </span>What did it mean?<span>  </span>I knew enough to be aware I was missing something, but what?<span>   </span>And then there was the fierce competition between cabins.<span>  </span>I began to wonder whether everything my mother had taught us at home as normal human behavior was actually deviant.<span>          </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">What brought on full blown homesickness in me was a tactless remark from some older girl, a sarcasm, some condescension that made me suddenly aware of how young I was, how terribly out of place.<span>  </span>The girl might have been Maureen, who by then had surrendered John to our counselor, Nancy.<span>  </span>I don’t remember.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">It’s mid-week and I am brushing my teeth in the rough-timbered, stinky bathroom.<span>  </span>The windows have been propped open and sparky bright morning air flows above the row of sinks.<span>  </span>Someone—say it’s Maureen&#8211;is standing beside me at the next sink.<span>  </span>She is a willowy high school girl with some power to say what happens at camp.<span>  </span>Her long, brown hair curls tastefully on her shoulders.<span>  </span>I feel a presence, and I look up at her, seeing that she is watching me, appraising me.<span>  </span>The glistening, hard black of her pupils in the middle of her blue eyes makes my heart hammer in my chest.<span>  </span>I work to breathe.<span>  </span>I feel like a flailing fish in a boat.<span>  </span>I try not to betray my alarm.<span>     </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>“Hi,” </span>I say through a mouthful of Colgate.<span>  </span>I have learned that much.<span>  </span>You have to greet people in the morning, even if you don’t feel like it.<span>  </span>Even if you never greet members of your own family at home.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">She tosses her hair back.<span>  </span>“Are you old enough for this camp?” she asks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I bet you’re not eleven!”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I’m ten.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>“Honey, Jesus wants you for a sunbeam</span>.”<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I’m not sure what she means by this, so I am unable to contribute a reply to the conversation she has honored me by starting.<span>  </span>In our church they sing <em>Jesus Wants You For A Sunbeam</em> at the children’s service.<span>  </span>The last time I sang it, I was about six.<span>   </span>It slowly dawns on me that Maureen must be telling me I am too young to be here.<span>  </span>I realize that she’s probably been watching me observe and then follow what the older kids do.<span>  </span>I wonder whether I appear even more bizarre than I feel.<span>  </span>I hear the water gushing from the faucet.<span>  </span>Outside there is the sound of tremendous flapping, as if wet sheets are blowing in a gale.<span>  </span>I see through the window a mob of startled crows taking to sky.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Maureen is standing with her orange toothbrush in her mouth, staring at me, waiting for me to reply.<span>  </span>I try to think of something, but my mind is blank and smooth as a bald gray highway going nowhere. I’m breathing fast.<span>  </span>I turn and begin brushing my teeth again.<span>  </span>She shuts the water off with a flourish and walks out.<span>  </span>That seems to put a period at the end of the long sentence of my weeklong childish incompetence.<span>  </span>Suddenly, after my conversation with Maureen, I long to go home.<span>  </span>I begin feeling what I later learn the word for.<span>  </span>I feel homesick.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">When I am done brushing my teeth, I walk to the canteen.<span>  </span>I saunter around the tables, pretending to be interested in the pastel candy with Bible verses printed on it or the fluorescent bumper stickers announcing that GOD IS LOVE.<span>  </span>But the cross reels me in a slow circle around it.<span>  </span>Finally I reach the table and pick it up.<span>  </span>I feel calmer.<span>  </span>I hold it in a shadow and it gives off lovely greening light.<span>         </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Homesickness is a disease that rivets its victim’s imagination on home so powerfully that nothing else seems real.<span>   </span>I, who had read <em>The Boxcar Children</em> and dreamed the pleasures of being an orphan, began suffering from an imagination entirely filled up with my mother.<span>  </span>I pictured her stepping into her car the Monday I left for camp.<span>  </span>I heard her voice calling my name over and over.<span>  </span>I smelled her Tweed perfume and felt her hand lightly on the back of my neck.<span>  </span>The very woodsy air I breathed stifled me.<span>  </span>I couldn’t eat.<span>  </span>I cried.<span>  </span>I vomited.<span>  </span>My head pulsated.<span>  </span>I feared talking to anyone, in case I might dissolve in tears.<span>  </span>I was infected with self-consciousness.<span>  </span>I watched myself like a homesick child in a movie who loses weight, dwindles, and slowly dissolves into the landscape.<span>  </span>The next day, I stayed in my cabin during Hymn Sing and Bible Study.<span>  </span>Pastor Ray didn’t notice.<span>  </span>Even Nancy didn’t notice.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Dutifully I went to craft time, where I lolled in front of bins of Popsicle sticks and clay and yarn strips and paper and sequins and glue and paints.<span>  </span>I could not think of a single reason to pick up any of it.<span>  </span>I needed to lie down.<span>  </span>I wanted to sleep.<span>  </span>The counselor in charge cheerfully tried to convince me to braid a lanyard, which he said I could use as a key chain.<span>  </span>He suggested different colors, the bright gold, the royal blue, the forest green.<span>  </span>The thing is, I didn’t own any keys.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Then give it to your mother,” he suggested.<span>   </span>I wanted to see my mother so desperately that the very word <em>mother </em>made me bolt from the tent.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">My mother’s friend, Audrey Jones, who had brought me to camp, drove up on Friday to volunteer.<span>  </span>She must have noticed that something was wrong with me.<span>  </span>She lured me out of my cabin by inviting me to the canteen.<span>  </span>She bought me a coke, and asked me whether I was all right.<span>  </span>She meant well.<span>  </span>But all I could see was how different she was from my cozy, black-haired mother.<span>  </span>She was athletic and plain-spoken, with a square jaw.<span>  </span>She had a habit of wearing anklets with heels.<span>  </span>As I sat at the table across from her, I couldn’t talk, I was so homesick.<span>  </span>I knew I was being monstrously ungrateful.<span>  </span>Her only crime was not being my mother.<span>  </span>But I was unable to stop the mawkish longing that this woman could not satisfy.<span>   </span>We listened to the rain beating on the canteen’s metal siding.<span>   </span>We sat together in awkward silence, a generous, concerned adult and the broken child she was trying to help.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The week at camp turned so ghastly partly because there wasn’t much adult supervision and our counselors were unprepared to manage a bunch of children.<span>  </span>And maybe my mother should have foreseen that.<span>  </span>But I need to explain.<span>  </span>She coyly lured me into signing up for this camp because I’d spent the previous August roving our neighborhood with a juvenile delinquent named Junior.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I took Junior with me one afternoon when my mother sent me to the supermarket down the block from our house to buy a bottle of catsup.<span>  </span>I had only been in the store a couple of times and as we strolled through the aisles I beheld a fantasy world I could barely believe.<span>  </span>We had just moved to Lincoln from Parkers Prairie, where my father’s General Store with its 8 aisles was the whole world of commerce.<span>  </span>But in this bright daydream of a supermarket I gazed at cartons of chocolate and pistachio and strawberry ice cream.<span>  </span>There were a dozen different kinds and colors of pasta.<span>  </span>There were cheeses of all shapes and colors and sizes.<span>  </span>I beheld Hershey bars and Mars bars and Heath bars and pink bubble gum with funnies and strings of licorice and chocolate frosting mix that our family could never hope to buy.<span>  </span>Pushing a cart, Junior and I started out with good intentions, but soon we were merely pretending to shop, stuffing licorice and Mary Janes and Hershey bars into our pockets.<span>  </span>Along the way, we dropped a bottle of catsup into the cart and stood in the check-out line and paid for it so we would appear legitimate and no one would suspect us.<span>  </span>We brought the catsup home to my mother and then made for our hide-out in Junior’s garage where we knocked back candy until my mother called me for dinner.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Some afternoons Junior and I lurked around houses in the neighborhood, sneaking onto porches and snitching whatever we fancied.<span>  </span>We invoked the “finders keepers” rule.<span>  </span>We figured that if people left toys and sprinklers out, our minor thievery might keep them from falling prey to even greater thievery. <span> </span>One afternoon we pillaged cookie samples from the garage of a Keebler salesman and ate them till we lay like fat ticks on his front lawn.<span>  </span>Afterwards, I felt vaguely guilty.<span>  </span>That evening when I saw a man heading for our front porch, I felt alarm.<span>  </span>His lunging walk and balled-up fists tipped me off.<span>  </span>I shouldn’t have taken the cookies.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">He rang our doorbell.<span>  </span>My mother answered the door.<span>  </span>He told her that her daughter had stolen and eaten the samples he needed to make a living.<span>   </span>He shouted loudly enough to attract attention from our neighbor, who stopped coiling his garden hose and watched.<span>  </span>The cookie salesman cursed and stomped his foot.<span>      </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">My mother slipped into her self-assured nurse persona.<span>  </span>“Oh, no, I don’t think my daughter would do that,” she informed him.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span> </span>He raised his voice.<span>  </span>He used words that were forbidden in our family.<span>  </span>My mother flipped the screen door lock to keep him outside and summoned me.<span>  </span>“This man says you went into his garage and took his cookies.”<span>  </span>I could feel her eyes evaluating me.<span>  </span>“You wouldn’t do that, would you?”<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span> </span>I swallowed back terror.<span>  </span>“No,” I told her.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">No.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">But my mother was not a fool.<span>  </span>Bible camp was her way of separating me from Junior.<span>  </span>Maybe she thought at Bible camp I’d experience a programmatic change of heart.<span>  </span>As it turns out, that week did set me on different path, but not one she would have chosen; she was a committed Baptist and religious images gave her the heebie jeebies.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">On Friday afternoon, I made a final journey to the canteen to look at the cross.<span>  </span>I’d taken that walk many times, even though I had decided early in the week that I couldn’t afford it.<span>  </span>Walking into the canteen tent, I saw they were having a sale.<span>  </span>The price of the cross had been slashed to a dollar thirty.<span>  </span>Noticing that I was eying it again, the man at the counter asked me how much money I had.<span>  </span>I showed him my dollar ten.<span>  </span>He took my money, slipped the cross in a bag, and handed it to me.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">For the first time during the entire week, I felt joy.<span>  </span>I crawled under the display table, where the cross illuminated the dark.<span>  </span>By its light I could see under the covers of my bunk.<span>  </span>And that night it lit up the path when I traveled alone to the bathroom.<span>  </span>Its Halloweeny radiance appeared transcendent to me, as it apparently did not to other campers.<span>  </span>There were almost as many necklaces remaining on the commissary table at the end of camp as there had been at the beginning.<span>   </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I don’t remember what happened to that cross.<span>  </span>During one of my many moves I must have given it away, probably because it bespoke a childhood I wanted to shed.<span>  </span>But it signaled a beginning, too, the first time I’d felt drawn to an image.<span>  </span>It was finally images and metaphors with their multivalent power that I followed out of my mother’s fundamentalism.<span>  </span>Now, as I sit here writing, I wish I could take the cross out again and look at it.<span>  </span>It was kitschy, I admit.<span>  </span>But I would make it stand for something, maybe for the fact that our most crucial decisions are small ones that start as secrets inside us and find their way out.<span>   </span>I’d let it stand for that mystery at the center of each of us and for the unpredictable, funny grace that can befall us&#8211;because it was grace, surely, that made me see the beauty of that cross.<span>  </span>I’d let the cross mark the first time I remember feeling the bitter-sweet longing we call homesickness and the first time I aligned myself against my mother’s literal way of seeing the world.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">On the bumpy ride back home with Audrey Jones, I looked forward to seeing my mother the way I looked forward to Christmas.<span>  </span>I wore the cross, holding it steady in a chute of sunlight that streamed into the car window.<span>  </span>I could almost hear the thing gathering whatever light it could into itself.<span>  </span>I wanted to show Mother how much light it gave off.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">When I got home, I did, I showed her.<span>   </span>“That’s nice,” she said and opened the oven to check whether the squash was done.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">She had not been homesick for me, of course, and she had no way of knowing that I had been homesick for her, because I didn’t know how to tell her.<span>  </span>And how could she know that I had been set on a path to collide with her most deeply felt and believed faith?<span>  </span>I didn’t know it yet myself.<span>  </span>Like much of what’s important, that remained secret.<span>  </span>Mother made a cake and the whole family celebrated my return. <span> </span>But that night, in my own bed, I watched the cross slowly pay out radiance into the darkness.<span>  </span>As the day around it failed and night came, it grew steadily more articulate, its edges sharpening against the dark.<span>  </span>It seemed like a star that had fallen to earth, something a person could navigate by.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Late in Queen Victoria’s century, a young Jesuit seminarian set the following entry  down  in his notebook:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;April 27, 1871&#8230;.Mesmerized a duck with chalk lines drawn from her beak sometimes level and sometimes forward on a black table. They explain that the bird keeping the abiding offscape of the hand gripping her neck fancies she is still held down and cannot lift her head as long as she looks at the chalk line, which she associates with the power that holds her . This duck lifted her head at once when I put it down on the table without chalk. But this seems inadequate. It is most likely the fascinating instress of the straight white stroke.&#8221; <a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Most of us will recognize the author of these lines thanks to those gorgeously inscrutable bits about “the abiding offscape of the hand” and the “fascinating instress.” They are in part the evidence of Gerard Manley Hopkins trying his damndest not to be a poet. Before he came to study at the Jesuit College of Stonyhurst, he had burned all of his youthful verse, regarding it as a distraction from his true calling to the priesthood. But as we know, Hopkins was unsuccessful in his desire to resist the poetry itch. A few years into the future he will give up his efforts to suppress his creative urges (he was apparently much more successful at suppressing the sexual ones, but that’s another story), and break his long poetic silence with the most unreadable great poem in the language, “The Wreck of the Deutschland.” From that point on, Hopkins would be a majestic poet but a mediocre priest. During his Stonyhurst years, he can’t write poetry, but he can certainly write like a poet in his notebooks.  He watches a field of bluebells waver in the light, comparing them to “the spots on a snake.” He goes ga-ga over a peacock’s train, as mesmerized by its finery as his duck was by the chalk line: he feels himself being stared at by a thousand eyes that “fall into irregular rows” when the peacock spreads his train. When the peacock lowers his train, he likens the eyes to “scales or gadroons.”  <em>Gadroons!—</em>an architectural term for “a band of convex molding ornamentally carved with beading or reeding.” The description goes on&#8211;lavish, maniacal, ecstatic: “the outermost eyes, detached and singled, give with their corner fringes the suggestion of that inscape of the flowing cusped trefoil” that he has seen in certain paintings. None of this makes us see the peacock anew; the passage doesn’t <em>make the familiar strange</em>; it’s too fastidiously wacky. Descriptions such as this, like so many passages in Hopkins’ poems, have little to do with accuracy of seeing—there are no images akin to Bishop’s characterization of fireflies looking <em>exactly</em> like champagne bubbles—but everything to do with <em>intensity </em>of seeing. No one else has seen the world quite like Hopkins; he out-surreals the surrealists. Yes, the purpose of this looking is devotional, evidence that the world is charged (and charged and charged) with the grandeur of God, a pantheism that many of his fellow Jesuits would have found a bit heretical. Be that as it may, the immediate effect of reading Hopkins’ encounter with his duck is plain, visceral, jaw-dropping astonishment. It may not bring me to a greater closeness with the Almighty, but it somehow helps to restore my faith in the things of this world—what bizarre delights it offers!—and my faith that a writer can see this bizarreness so uniquely is similarly restored. I may not hear Louis Armstrong rasping about what a wonderful world this is, but the mere fact that Hopkins <em>hypnotized a duck</em> and thought enough of the action to record it—for himself, if not for posterity—is enthralling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, neither we nor Hopkins are ever content to let sleeping ducks lie. Hopkins immediately seeks to explain the whole business. Some unnamed “they”—experts on duck hypnosis, presumably&#8211;have gone before him in this experiment, and the duck seems to associate the chalk line with the power of the unseen hand that held it down. We see Hopkins mulling this theory over. Clearly part of him is inclined to give it some credence, and we suspect it is because the possibilities of religious allegory are so obvious: God is the hand and we are the ducks. Even unseen and when not overtly wielding His power, His Hand Hath Stroked our feathers. If you leap to this interpretation (and Hopkins was certainly likely to have done so) that invisible hand seems both a burden and a consolation. This ambivalence is precisely the one explored in one of the greatest lyrics of our language’s other essential devotional poet—George Herbert in “The Collar,” who initially sees his clerical collar as not much different from a yoke put on an oxen. So Hopkins is God’s Duck, Herbert God’s Ox. Yet at the same time, Hopkins is questioning this whole premise. “This seems inadequate. It is most likely the fascinating instress of the straight white stroke.” I take this to be Hopkins lingo for saying that duck finds the chalk line pretty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inadequate it seems to me, too, much as I love this notebook entry. And so I recently wrote to my friends Dawn Cooper, who is an internationally recognized animal trainer, and her husband the novelist and poet Clint McCown.  I quoted the notebook entry, wanting to see what they thought of what the subject line of my email called, “the duck thing-y.” Here’s Clint’s reply:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dawn wrote out an explanatory email about the duck thingy, but it got devoured by the universe when she tried to send it to me.  So I&#8217;ll summarize as best I can from what she told me.</p>
<p>She said research has been done on ducks that connects visual stimuli to involuntary physical responses.  She surmises (by piecing together five or six separate studies) that somehow their optic receptors can lock onto something like a white line because it can be mistaken by their little duck brains for markings on a duck of the opposite sex and they freeze into a particular duck pose&#8211;head lowered in submission to show willingness to get together and have baby ducks.  So as weird as it sounds, a duck&#8217;s brain seems to be hardwired for forcing the body to strike and hold a particular pose if confronted with a white line stimulus.  I guess a white line is the equivalent of duck porn.  So as strange as the Hopkins passage is, it falls within the realm of what has actually been observed and studied in ducks.</p>
<p>What a world. Hopkins thinks it&#8217;s all about God, scientists think it&#8217;s all about sex.  I think it&#8217;s all about design flaws.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, dear reader, it gets curiouser and curiosuer. A few days later, I encounter the following passage by another author, one also much concerned with religion and wildlife:</p>
<blockquote><p>Great day w/bear management wildlife biologists; much to see in wild territory incl amazing creatures w/mama bears&#8217; gutteral raw instinct to protect &amp; provide for her young… She sees danger? She brazenly rises up on strong hind legs, growls Don&#8217;t Touch My Cubs &amp; the species survives &amp; mama bear doesn&#8217;t look 2 anyone else 2 hand her anything; biologists say she works harder than males, is provider/protector for the future…Yes it was another outstanding day in AK seeing things the rest of America should see; applicable life lessons we&#8217;re blessed to see firsthand. <a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>This is a Tweet posted from her Blackberry by Sarah Palin, not long before she resigns her position as Governor of Alaska in favor of whatever future career she is plotting for herself. There is obviously a desire on the governor’s part to identify herself with the mother Grizzly, rearing up menacingly to protect her young  from the lampoons of insidious Leftist Antichrists such as David Letterman, or from attacks by various disgruntled State Troopers, Levi Johnstons, and former McCain staffers. She manages, too, to put in a plug for Alaska tourism and a dig at the wimps who reside in the lower forty-eight, all in the space of a passage that, if you’re counting, is only three words longer than Hopkins’ duck opus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The differences between these two authors go without saying: one is a genius, by all accounts a tortured, deeply insecure, and deeply humble soul. The other is cunning, crafty, but by no means a genius and by no means humble. But is it equally obvious to state an even more troubling contrast between the two passages: one is set down for the writer’s private consumption, edification, and insight (or inscape, to use Hopkins-speak); it is set down in a bound paper notebook, in the pencil that Hopkins favored over ink, and in a hand that one of Hopkins’ editors complains is “minute….frequently smudged, and at times almost illegible.” Illegible, perhaps, but also <em>tangible</em>, designed so that the eyes may see what the hand has done, to paraphrase Robert Lowell. The other is spewed out, presumably <em>in situ</em>: the Governor rearranges her bobby pins as Mama Grizzly snarls, as the park ranger warns that they’d better make a run for it, and as they do she still is furiously texting on her Blackberry, employing all the irritating mannerisms of text-speak rather than the glorious oddity of Hopkins-speak: the ampersands, the number two substituted for “to,” the almost-Teutonic tic for compound nouns like “provider/protector.” And these musings are going out in real time to her equally demented worshipful minions. Texting of this sort is purely a mode of self-gratifying  performance: it has little to do with more intimate and authentic communication. Buddy in Orange County is watching it all unfold on his computer screen, to which he’s affixed a “NoBama” sticker. “Come here right now, Edna,” he’s telling his wife, “Sarah’s being trailed by a Grizzly!” Yes, it’s absurd, but it’s also demagoguery. Experience is turned to fodder for the blogosphere, and the import of the message is twisted and xenophobic, following in the tradition of the barefaced paranoia of Father Coglin’s radio rants of the 1930s, or Pound’s lunatic radio speeches from Mussolini’s Rome. No, Blackberrying will not cause you to think like Sarah Palin, let alone like poor old Ez. But what I want to offer in these pages is a kind of homage the force behind Hopkins’ stubby pencil and his cramped inscrutable cursive. I want to offer what I fear is an elegy to the handwritten word, as it’s set down in a unlined blank bound sketchbook, or the green lined pages of a pocket-sized moleskine, or a yellow legal pad, or a Blue Octavo of the sort that was so dear to Kafka. I want us to praise the notebook—both in and of itself and for what it tells us about the workings of a poet’s mind, and for how it helps us to chart the process of inspiration turning to what in time becomes a finished poem. I seek to make this offering before the handwritten notebook becomes yet another “dead format,” and before the kind of discourse, inclusiveness and attentiveness which is can represent disappears entirely from our consciousness. And make no mistake, reader, this disappearance is inevitable. We will still write our observations and our poems on some form of media, but as our methods change our consciousness will change as well, and not always to the good. Give me Hopkins’ duck, and let the Grizzly use her “gutteral raw instinct” to sense that genuine danger lurks within that black thing with the tiny keyboard in the human female’s hands. Seize it from her now, Great Beast; give her a chance to flee, but then tear those microchips to shreds with your claws.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t make me out to be a Luddite here. I suppose you could say my stance toward this whole business is Janus-like. As I write this, I can turn to my bookshelf and see a stack of bound notebooks, going back to the mid-1980s. (There are a good many others in storage in the attic and in the closet of my office at school…) I fill one, or sometimes two of them per year. Like many writers, my choice of materials to write with derives from habit, superstition and compulsion. I’m not as anal retentive as Thomas Mann, who would not do <em>any </em>writing before a visit to his manicurist, nor or as charmingly sweet-tempered as Keats, who would always put on his best suit before embarking on a letter or poem. But I am set in my ways: I can only write on black, hard-bound, 8 1/2 x 11 unlined artists’ sketch books. For many years I preferred to write with a black micro-point felt marker called (embarrassingly) “Le Pen.” Since these are now hard to find, I now make do with another felt marker—the Uniball Vision Unique. I write nothing in cursive, since I often can’t read my own left-handed scrawl, a problem I attribute to the Catholic Church: in second grade, my parents sent me to parochial school for a year. I’d learned to print with my left hand, but a nun named Sister Immaculata forbade the use of what she termed The Devil’s Side, and I was forced to make do with my right hand. This, among other things, ended my parents’ flirtation with private schooling, and the following year I went back to the public school and the Devil’s Hand. But the damage was done: my cursive always looks like gibberish. I must confess that I love the way the notebooks occupy their couple of feet of bookshelf space, along with several black spring binders filled with finished or abandoned poems. (These binders, like Le Pens, are now somewhat hard to get hold of; I’m told that only one company&#8211;Elbe-Cisco of Fall River, MA—continues to manufacture them.) Yet the notebooks are propped up not by a bookend, but by a Bose Soundock on which the newer of my two i-Pods rests (The first ran out of space for my music library, and its 164 GB successor is loading up fast.) And of course the words you are reading are being typed out on a laptop, from which I’ve just called up my friend Clint’s Duck Thing-y email and pasted it onto my text, along with Palin’s insufferable Tweet. I am also calling up the archives of the online journal <em>Blackbird—</em>in part because they contain a brilliant uncollected poem by the late Larry Levis that I plan to paste into my text as well, in part because the archives also contain a video, c. 1992 or thereabouts, of Levis reading the poem (that I will play while the i-Pod is also chiming out the Drive By-Truckers), and in part because the poem will testify that I am not alone in my Janus-like condition regarding new media vs. old.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Levis poem is entitled “Poem Ending With a Hotel on Fire.” It is close to six pages in length, and, like so many of Levis’ later efforts, it is something of a loose baggy monster. The poem veers from seemingly improvisational free association to an almost-prophetic self-possession. Here’s the opening passage:</p>
<blockquote><p>Poor means knowing the trees couldn&#8217;t care less</p>
<p>Whether you carve the initials of your enemies</p>
<p>All over the trunk&#8217;s white bark,<br />
Or whether this sleep beneath them is your last.</p>
<p>In the contorted figures meant to represent their sleep,<br />
The statistics never show the deep shade in the park,</p>
<p>The mother appearing in the dark of someone within whose<br />
Sprawled arms clear gin and black tar mingle<br />
To compose the blood&#8217;s unwriteable psalm.</p>
<p>The blackening church bells say the poor are wrong,<br />
So does the traffic stalling on the bridge; so does the lazy swirl<br />
Of current underneath it all, a smile fading in the dark.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>What I love is the way you would whisper against<br />
The current, into the dark,</p>
<p>&#8220;But what you mean by <em>poor </em>is…some figure &amp; concealment<br />
By which they are forgotten. But the figure itself is a kind</p>
<p>Of poverty. I don&#8217;t mean just…money. I mean poverty</p>
<p>In the widest possible…<em>sense.</em>&#8221; There was the sound</p>
<p>Of crickets in a ravine I listened to so closely one evening</p>
<p>It became only a vast chirring, then a thing not there, then</p>
<p>The roar of a fire. It was like being, or pretending to be,</p>
<p>Without speech. To be without speech means no one<br />
Listening, &amp; that the flames scaling the neighborhood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like mirrors</p>
<p>Can not even pretend to. This is</p>
<p>Where the poor are not permitted to see themselves…

<p>We can’t help but hear the voice of Hopkins in Levis’ strangely numinous descriptions of “the vast chirring of the crickets” and “the blood’s unwriteable psalm.” But the poem is about protest rather than praise, lamenting impoverishment as both a social injustice and a spiritual condition. It also seems to be a poem of lost love, describing a “you” who appears to be both a real individual and a muse figure. The poem continues on for several stanzas before introducing its first moment of sustained narrative. With a third of the poem finished, we are finally told of the hotel fire alluded to in the title:</p>
<blockquote><p>Once in a hotel in Cincinnati, I saw a woman decorated,</p>
<p>Like a kind of human Christmas tree, in money. All down<br />
the buttons of her blouse &amp; in fact all over her blouse &amp; skirt,</p>
<p>The men, for whom, I heard later, she had been hired as<br />
A private dancer, had pinned twenties, hundreds, fifties,</p>
<p>Rolls of smaller bills—&amp; as the alarm blared its one note &amp;</p>
<p>The beige smoke—billowy, calm signature of whoever had set<br />
The upper floors on fire—began filling</p>
<p>The corridor, we arrived at the elevator in the same<br />
Moment, &amp; waited—I in shorts &amp; a faded t-shirt with three</p>
<p>Naked Jamaicans on it who were, once, <em>The Itals,</em><br />
And she in the most expensive dress I had ever seen—</p>
<p>And when the elevator didn&#8217;t show we ran down the steel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &amp; concrete</p>
<p>Stairs that seemed to ring and ring with our steps.</p>
<p>Later, in the lobby bar, her purse so stuffed with bills<br />
The bartender simply said, &#8220;It&#8217;s cool,&#8221; &amp; raised both hands</p>
<p>Above his head when we tried to pay, she would talk only<br />
Of her one obsession, which had nothing to do with money nor</p>
<p>Swaying to music, nor men,</p>
<p>But with purebred Abyssinian cats, the trouble she went to,</p>
<p>Taking them—traveling with four howling cages behind her<br />
In the back of a station wagon—to shows all over</p>
<p>The Midwest. The worst part though, she said, was that<br />
The shows were rigged, the judges were paid off….</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anecdote of the fire and the speaker’s subsequent encounter with the woman is as consummately outlandish as the poem’s free-associative opening. As the speaker continues his conversation with her, she seems progressively more demented, claiming, among other things, that the corrupt cat show judges have even tried to frame her on murder charges. But then the narrative shifts again. We’re given a lengthy description of a gang of drugged-out teenagers as they set the hotel ablaze in a kind of warped prank. The description of the conflagration is grimly humorous, lushly detailed, and, well, pyrotechnical.  And the passage leaves us completely unprepared for the tonal shift which occurs when the dancer returns to the story. Now the poem reverts to the associative method of its opening. As the poem concludes, the imagery is militantly (but eccentrically) apocalyptic:</p>
<blockquote><p>…the doors opened onto flames.</p>
<p>In the photographs she showed me the Abyssinians looked</p>
<p>Emaciated, &amp;, though I couldn&#8217;t say why, like a species that<br />
Had survived its own extinction. Their pale eyes suggested</p>
<p>Nothing at all. They looked back like the face of famine,</p>
<p>Their thin, ridged spines older than even the ancient<br />
Illustrations of cats on tombs, cats that had been the pets</p>
<p>Of kings &amp; now slept beside them in the straight-jacketed,<br />
Dry, whirlpool of bandages they had wrapped kings in so that</p>
<p>They might descend without distractions. Did the doors<br />
Of tombs open onto flames? The faces of the cats<br />
Caught in the photographs would never tell.</p>
<p>Their gray fur was like blurred print or the blank, chirring<br />
Blizzard on the t.v. set above the bar. Nothing would tell.</p>
<p>Once in a blizzard in a foreign city, having lost my way,<br />
I wondered what it would be like to be one of those—blind<br />
Drunk, high, or homeless—who would have<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no alternative except</p>
<p>To freeze to death, &amp; thought how, after the initiation of pain,<br />
They say it is like being lulled to sleep, the way the snow</p>
<p>Appears to faint as it swirls in the locked doorways of shops,<br />
The way this would be the last thing that appeared to you</p>
<p>There, before whatever was left of you became gradually<br />
Confused with a small part of the upsway</p>
<p>Of snow &amp; wind.</p>
<p>It is all a matter of confusing yourself with something else:</p>
<p>The soul curls up in a doorway, &amp; lets the snow swirl around it.</p>
<p>And…not just money then, but…<em>poverty</em>, I thought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  in the widest</p>
<p>Possible…<em>sense</em> of the term, would</p>
<p>Be…But then I knew what it would be.</p>
<p>For a moment I could hear the cats howling in their steel cages,<br />
Their thin spines turning in circles.</p>
<p>Tattoo on a forearm &amp; shriek of the wind, &amp; no figure drawn<br />
In the night&#8217;s silent contemplation by which</p>
<p>The poor might be forgotten;</p>
<p>And not you beside me in the dark but only a dry fern &amp; a Bible<br />
In the room, the rain beginning its long descent onto the roof—</p>
<p>Its sound the chirring of crickets in a ravine.</p>
<p>I could almost hear…No, I could only imagine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  hearing it. And that</p>
<p>Is what it has become:</p>
<p>Having to imagine, having to imagine everything,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In detail, and without end.<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it is an abnegation of critical responsibility to quote a passage as long as this. But the poem’s ending resists excerption, and perhaps even analysis. Suffice to say that all of the poem’s wildly disparate motifs return, and with an even greater degree of rhetorical and associative intensity. Ultimately, the vision of the poem’s closing is not so much one of apocalypse as of damnation. (References to Dante abound in Levis’s later poetry: note the allusion to Canto I of <em>The Inferno </em>in “Once in a foreign city in a blizzard, I lost my way….”) Here is The Fire Next Time as prophesized in the King James. And the vision of the afterlife conveyed in the final lines, of eternity as a state of endlessly stillborn creation, both astonishes and horrifies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Poem Ending with a Hotel on Fire” was written at the same time as the poems which comprise Levis’ great posthumous collection, <em>Elegy,</em> which was edited by Philip Levine and published the year after Levis’ death in 1996. The book was unfinished. When Levine assembled the manuscript, he made the decision that the only poems from Levis’ final years that would be included in the volume were ones which the poet had published or sent to journals. Levine regarded all the others as unfinished, and therefore not candidates for inclusion. Yet my colleague Greg Donovan, who was among those who discovered Levis’ body—he’d suffered a heart attack, his body found beside his writing table; he’d died while at work on a poem—made a careful examination of the tote bag where, in three of those black spring binders from Elbe Cisco, Levis kept typed manuscripts of poems presumably destined for his book. Greg feels that “Elegy Ending with a Hotel on Fire” was intended to be the new collection’s closing poem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would not be surprised if this were the case. All of the key stylistic and formal gestures of the later Levis are confidently on display. There’s the long undulating line with its couplets and tercets and Levis’ suave fourteeners. And of course there’s the searing chiliastic grandeur of the closing. It seems less a poem about finality as it does a writer’s <em>final </em>statement, a work in the tradition of Villon’s “Great Testament” and o Tichborne’s terrifying self-elegy, composed in the Tower of London on the eve of his execution. Here’s something left among Levis’ papers, written on the back of an envelope:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think I might build eternity into a poem, one brick, one brush of the pen at a time, an argument against one contradiction or the next, until it stares out, like the sphinx, past everyone but me. After all, I wrote it. I’m 47. My mind, my thought, has never felt so passionate, so shapely or as free of ideologies. Poetry underwrites consideration for all else. I am what made me. <em>I am not 4</em></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Levis was 49 at the time of his death, and we should assume that this passion and freedom from the merely ideological remained with him until he began to set down that final poem he was at work on at the moment of his death.  Clive James, reminding us that the terror and totalitarianism of the past century all derives from ideological fervor, defines ideology as “premature synthesis”—Levis would have agreed with this.  But other things, including, sadly, much about his writing process, will not be ours to discover. Earlier this fall I found myself in Virginia Commonwealth University Library’s special collection room, rummaging through Levis’ recently donated papers to find drafts for “Poem Ending With a Hotel on Fire.” A few months before that, Larry’s friend Mary Flinn&#8211;who had kept his papers in storage for some dozen years&#8211;his son Nicholas, his sister Sheila Brady and I stood with head librarian John Ulmschneider to survey the papers; they took up fifteen boxes. One held a pair of cowboy boots and a leather jacket, which Nick took from the box and tried on. I knew Larry Levis only very slightly; I was privy to this event because I now hold the job he once had. But there was something both majestic and bittersweet about the moment. Now Larry’s literary remains would be available to scholars in the way that we hope an important writer’s work should always be. But what comprises <em>any</em> life—at least when it’s stuffed into a set of cardboard boxes on a couple of tables&#8211;seems bewildering and paltry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bewildering: on that fall day I looked through five boxes of <em>Elegy</em>-era material my bewilderment only intensified. The Levis holdings have yet to be “processed’ by the library, so they remain only very loosely organized. Tucked among drafts of poems were things like checkbook deposit slips, poems by Larry’s students, his annual report to the department chair, copies of letters to Phil Levine, that astonishing self-appraisal scribbled on the back of the envelope, and sheet after sheet of yellow legal paper, on which poems seem to have been started. Levis’ handwriting was bold and assertive, but just as illegible as Hopkins’. And nowhere could I find anything that seemed to be an first or early draft of “Hotel on Fire…” Because the holdings had yet to be processed and a former student of mine was manning the special collections desk, I was given privileges that no other special collections library would permit you. No pencil-only-on-a legal pad for my notes; in fact, I had with me my black notebook and my Le Pen, jotting down in it whatever seemed important—titles of uncollected poems,  passages on the legal pads that later made their way into published poems. But there was nothing at all that seemed to suggest the genesis of “Hotel on Fire…” Yes, there were several typescript drafts of the poem, but most had only a few words changed. I then performed another special collection no-no and called Greg Donovan on my cell, wanting to know if he’d seen any early drafts of the poem. The problem, said Greg, was one that the survivors of most of you who are reading this would encounter if you were suddenly struck dead. While at home, Greg said, Levis did his writing on legal pads. But he had no home computer; the poems were all revised on the computer in his office. And like so many of us, Levis apparently kept files of individual poems, but no drafts of them—within the files, the poems seem to have been obsessively revised but with each new version an older version disappeared. Greg recalled that some of those files were copied onto disks, but couldn’t recall what happened to the actual computer, which was likely carted away by Technological Services when Levis’ office was reassigned, We know from some of the other Levis holdings that the poet would often do some serious mix and matching when he composed, cannibalizing a passages from a draft of one or more poems to later use in another, but whatever of this was done in “Hotel on Fire…” it seems we may never know. That this is a great loss there can be no doubt. We have the product: and in the case of “Poem Ending with a Hotel on Fire,” that product is one of the most notable poems of one of the best contemporary poets. But have only inklings of how it got to be that way. And, as writers, perhaps even more so than scholars, something in us wants evidence of the process as well as the product. And sometimes the way a writer changes a single word in a poem’s successive drafts brings us to all manner of intriguing speculation. For example, we know from the unabridged version of Curtis Bradford’s magisterial study of Yeats’ poetry manuscripts, <em>Yeats At Work, </em>that the poet struggled for a long while with the ending of his late poem “News from the Delphic Oracle,” perhaps the most extreme example of how the randy side of Yeats&#8211;which grew so prominent after his monkey gland operation, though it was doubtless only the placebo effect that accomplished this&#8211;commingled with the mythic and occultist side of his writing.  Yeats was Levis’ favorite poet, and  a passage as wild as this would surely have appealed to him:</p>
<blockquote><p>Down the mountain walls From where Pan’s cavern is<br />
Intolerable music falls.<br />
Foul goat head, brutal arm appear.<br />
Belly, shoulder, bum,<br />
Flash fishlike; nymphs and satyrs<br />
Copulate in the foam.<a href="#5"><sup>5</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Yeats’ toyed for a long while with using the f-word in place of “copulate,” a pretty radical decision for the 1930s, and if he’d done so the poem would surely be better known than it is. But <em>fuck</em> would have fucked things up. The alliteration would have been over-the-top, and effect would be comic thanks to the strong accents on <em>fuck </em> and <em>foam.</em> “Copulate in the foam” just sounds better, despite the Latinate Big Word, and the presence of four unstressed syllables in a row. Only Yeats could find a way to make a line with three times as many unstressed syllables as stressed ones sound engaging. This is an example of a little thing that is really a big thing: it invites into Yeats’ writing practice, to the attention to minutiae that most poets find fascinating, for it’s always the minutiae that counts the most in revision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As with revision, so with poets’ notebooks. As we see the minutiae accumulate, we see the evidence of mental agility, of junk and bric a brac—a conversation overheard, a lyric from <em>The Basement Tapes; </em>of Ur-poetry&#8211;an image set down to make use of later, a line from Unamuno you can’t wait to steal; of something you recall your parents or dead wife saying decades ago, or your eight-year-old saying on the previous day. The beautiful weird fodder that has to be put down even though you know it’s unlikely to ever make it into a poem. It’s a place where it somehow seems <em>important </em>to set down that the real reason William Randolph Hearst wanted to tried to get RKO to shut down the production of <em>Citizen Kane</em> was not because the movie satirized the newspaper magnet’s career, but because Welles had somehow discovered that “Rosebud” was the pet name Hearst had bestowed on the clitoris of his mistress, the actress Marion Davis. And these are things that go in the BOUND JOURNAL, not into “Daily Journal” program that comes with Microsoft Outlook, not onto your laptop while you sip a latté at Starbuck’s. The eyes have to see what the hands have done; the hands&#8211; not the keyboard. True, Auden warned that there’s a danger inherent in handwriting your observations: he allowed that you should go to the typewriter as soon as possible, for “most people like the look of their own handwriting in the way they enjoy the smell of their own farts.” But Auden had it wrong. The notebook is where the gorgeous slag of experience can reside; the flakes of gold and uncut  diamond can as often as not glitter out from it, but they can seem even more astonishing when they are yet to be polished or carved or placed in a setting. Charles Simic very sagely remarks that “our culture’s need to pigeonhole everything is defeated” in a writer’s notebooks. “Spontaneity rules here. The writer incorporates chances and makes do with the unforeseen. The head of a poet is more like a town dump than a town library.”  This seems very true to me, and Simic further states&#8211;on somewhat more shaky ground, but I’d like to believe him&#8211;that the computer will likely not replace “the fetishism of the notebook.”<a href="#6"><sup>6</sup></a> And, ironically, a byproduct of that fetishism may be durability&#8211;as we see from the example of Larry Levis, there’s a good chance that if you write something down on paper it will have a better chance of surviving into the future than if it were set down electronically. It’s sadly appropriate, somehow, that if there are any remaining drafts of a poem as apocalyptic as “Hotel on Fire,” they exist inside an archaic form of a Mac, and lie buried in a landfill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before going on, let me clarify a couple of things. I regard poets’ notebooks as work in a hybrid genre, as often as not mixing poetry, observation, aphorism, and the elements of a commonplace book. They are not to be confused with the more systematic (and often tedious) shape of diaries. Nor are they to be confused with the sort of prose that people who say they are “journaling” tend to write. When you “journal” you are not only abusing the language by turning a perfectly good noun into a perfectly awful verb&#8211;in the way that evangelicals talk about  getting together to do some “fellowshipping,” or disgruntled Facebookers “unfriend” somebody—but you also are also apt to use the work for navel-gazing and solipsistic self-analysis.  There’s nothing wrong with such endeavors, but they tend to be unliterary, inward looking rather than outward looking in the way a decent poet’s notebook has to be.  The journals I kept in my teens and twenties possessed an almost toxic level of such solipsism. As the years went on, however, my writing in the bound books changed quite a bit—less woe-is-me, and more observations, first drafts of poems, more less-than-brilliant aphorisms, more quotations from other writers, and in fact the quotations from other writers have over the years taken up the majority of space—as rightly they probably should.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem, however, with poets’ notebooks is not so much what we do with our individual efforts in the genre, but that the published examples of these documents have always been a frustrating mixture of the spectacular and the prosaic,  of lucidity and flatulence. What poets leave behind in their notebooks can show us a writer who is better at jotting there than he or she is as a poet. David Ignatow is a fine and uncompromising—though severely limited—poet of economic and class struggle. Yet the way his poetry addresses his key themes seems tepid when compared to the dogged ferocity of his published notebooks. Frost is among our great poets, but the portrait of the writer that we draw from his recently published notebooks is very much like the one that is rendered in Lawrence Thompson’s still controversial semi-authorized biography—bitter, vainglorious, deeply engaged by the world’s minutiae but all for the purpose of a sort of grim social Darwinism. Writers we deeply admire can seem lessened thanks to their notebooks, while writers we dislike can grow enormously in stature. Rene Char is much esteemed in his native France, regarded as perhaps the most ambitious and the most intellectually rigorous writer to emerge from the surrealist movement. Yet Char in his poetry has always seemed to me a cold fish. Not so the Char of <em>Leaves of Hypnos</em>, the poetic diary he kept during his years as a fighter in the French resistance,  a book that seems to me one of the most bracing meditations ever set down on the relationship between aesthetics and social engagement. (Hypnos was the Roman god of sleep, and also Char’s code name among the Maquis …) Consider the bedazzling associative affectedness of the following entry:</p>
<blockquote><p>Stars of the month of May….</p>
<p>Whenever I lift my eyes to the sky, nausea drops my jaw. I no longer hear, rising from the coolness of my eyes, <em>the moan of pleasure,</em> murmur of the woman ajar. An ash of prehistoric cacti makes my desert fly into pieces! I’m no longer <em>capable</em> of dying…</p>
<p>Cyclone, cyclone, cyclone…. <a href="#7"><sup>7</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Now consider the enormous urgency and necessity of an entry which follows only a few pages later:</p>
<blockquote><p>Horrible day! I was witness, some hundred meters away, to the execution of B. I had only to press the trigger of my Bren gun and he could have been saved! We were on the heights overlooking Ceriste, arms enough to make the bushes creak and at least equal in number to the SS. They unaware that we were there. To the eyes around me everywhere begging for the signal to open fire I answered no with my head… The June sun slipped a polar chill into my bones</p>
<p>He fell as if he didn’t make out his executioners, and so light, it seemed to me, that the last breath of wind could have lifted from earth.</p>
<p>I didn’t give the signal because the village had to be spared at <em>any price</em>. What is a village? A village like any other. Did <em>he</em> perhaps know at that ultimate instant? <a href="#8"><sup>8</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there’s Greece’s George Seferis, whose poetry, the cachet of his Nobel Prize notwithstanding, has always struck me as an oil and water mixture of Eliotic self-importance and Mediterranean sensuality—he’s a suntanned Prufrock in a bikini brief. Yet his <em>Days of 1945-1951: A Poet’s Journal, </em>is a book I’ve gone back to many times. Written shortly after his return to Greece after his escape to London in World War II, it’s comprised of fragments of poems that are better than his finished poems, the notes for a long unfinished essay on Cavafy that is perhaps the most perceptive criticism ever written on the Alexandrian master, and general speculations on a poet’s vocation that have stayed with me for decades: “In essence, a poet has only one theme—his living body.” “Suddenly you discover that you’ll spend your entire life in disorder. It’s all that you have. You must learn to live with it.” “Why does one write poems? Why, although there are such secret things (for him who writes them) does he consider them more important than anything else in life? This vital need.”<a href="#9"><sup>9</sup></a> You get a sense that Seferis regarded <em>Days of 1945-1951 </em>not as fodder for future poems and essays, but as a distinct work in its own right, something he shares with the sadly neglected Black Mountaineer Paul Blackburn, who came to think of his poetic journals—he called them <em>The Journals</em>&#8211;as his greatest poetic legacy. This seems to me the case as well, and Blackburn was certainly a much more accomplished improviser than a first-thought-best-thought peer such as Allen Ginsberg. Here, for example is the work’s penultimate entry/section, from July 1971. Blackburn, at 45, is dying of esophageal cancer. He’s taking a flight from the East to the  West Coast, a sadly valedictory journey, it seems. Readers below a certain age will find this implausible, but in those days they let you smoke on the plane, at least for part of journey:</p>

<p>Blackburn’s prediction proved right. He survived Stachmo by a few months, but not as far as 1972.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One reason why the notebooks of Ignatow, Char, and Seferis have the impact they do is that their authors were involved in their publication and arrangement, or, like Blackburn, left fair typescripts. This is not always a good thing: the Simic comments I quote from above come from an introduction to a volume called <em>The Poet’s Note Book: Excerpts from the Notebooks of 26 American Poets. </em>The intro is far more compelling than the notebook entries themselves, although they present work by a wide range of contemporary poets&#8211;among them Marvin Bell, Rita Dove, Carolyn Forche, James Merrill, William Matthews, and Donald Justice. But it’s all rather dull, self-serving and sanitized. The book is in essence a set of cherry-picked fragments, aphorisms and pensees designed mainly to make their authors look smart rather than to reflect their minds at work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But these writers in some respects fare better than those whose posthumously published notebooks were edited by the wrong hands. Theodore Rotheke’s <em>Straw For the Fire, </em>a selection of the poet’s journals edited by his student David Wagoner, is a bizarrely Oedipal affair. Wagoner does a serviceable job of selecting Roethke’s prose—there are wonderful notebook jottings on process and teaching and some manic aphorisms that bring to mind  Blake’s <em>Proverbs of Hell. </em>But Roethke, like Larry Levis, often composed his poems by knitting together fragments that originally were set down in his notebooks. At some point in the editing of <em>Straw for the Fire, </em> Wagoner seems to have decided he could do much the same with the pieces that Roethke had left on the cutting room floor, fashioning entirely “new” poems from them, to which he’s bestowed appropriately Roethkian titles along the lines of “The Mire’s My Home,” “Father-Stem and Mother Root,” “The Things I Steal From Sleep,” and “My Flesh Learned to Die.” You wouldn’t be surprised to come across a poem with one of these titles in <em>The Lost Son</em> or <em>The Far Field.</em> But are these pieces mainly Roethke or mainly Wagoner? The whole enterprise is ghoulish, much in the way that recording companies find ways to make dead singers keep coming up with new material. You know the drill: John Lennon and Buddy Holly have their gorgeously raw home demos turned into lushly orchestrated drivel. And somehow from the grave Jimi Hendrix releases several times as many albums  than he ever released during his lifetime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At least Wagoner was, in some perverse way, attempting to be discerning. On my desk beside me is a phonebook sized monstrosity called <em>Portrait of Delmore, </em>the notebooks of Roethke’s fellow middle generation poet Delmore Schwartz, who in his day was regarded as the figure who would leave all his contemporaries in the dust—all the Lowells, Berrymans, Rukeysers, Jarrells and Bishops. The notebook entries dating from Schwartz’s early career, roughly until the late 1940s, are intriguing, but only just so. When Schwartz’s mental illness and drinking and drugging become more pronounced, the work is excruciating, the fragments of poems mostly trite, and the self-appraisals agonizing, especially as Schwartz obsessively, for almost two years, contemplates the aftermath of the failure of his marriage to the novelist Elizabeth Pollett—who some twenty years after Schwartz’s death takes it upon herself to became  the editor of the volume. Pollett’s introduction to the volume is reasonable and tender—she states that, “in editing, my main principle was <em>readability</em>, with emphasis on any underlying dramatic themes.” [xv]. Yet what are we to make of an entry such as this, from May 14, 1959?</p>
<blockquote><p>Eight Dexedrine with a lift for an hour, during which I copied pages of Rilke. Then the bleakness and the emptiness came back. I walked twice to the park, stopped, the second time, at the Riviera—Liz Cooper was there, with her young shiftless friend Bill, and Wolfe O’Meara. And by 4 I had hurried to the White Horse, where I drank five, six, seven, or eight gin-and-tonics. Jeanne Adams came in and sat next to me and leaned against me. Later Zoe Broadwin—Harvard 1947—came in and greeted me as Delmore. But Jeanne kept me from talking to him, questioning me about why I was depressed. I argued with Dick Bagley (film maker) about Joyce—I was really arguing with some feeling that he has about himself which he projects into modern literature and art. Tom Clancy (folk singer, actor) defended Joyce too, and then left me in the middle by praising O’Casey (whom I have not really read). I began to feel maudlin as Bagley left after buying me a drink and calling me “one of the major poets of the century”! And I threw up (as I had on Tuesday, in the morning), after taking two s.t.s.” (628)<a href="#11"><sup>11</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>It breaks your heart&#8211;and what could Pollet have been <em>thinking</em> to let this out into the world?  And this is certainly not the most abashed or self-lacerating of Schwartz’s journal entries. In a final notebook that he was keeping when his body was found—he’d died from a heart attack in a skid row hotel elevator&#8211;Schwartz writes, “The poisonous world flows into my mouth/like water into a drowning man’s.”<a href="#12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Yet for all the damage that can be done to a posthumous reputation thanks to publications such as these, there are also some splendid examples of poetic justice being served. The critic Ruth Limmer devoted much of her career to preserving the literary reputation of Louise Bogan, a poet whose highly polished lyric precision now seems admirable but dated; she’s much better than the other woman formalists who emerged in the 1920s&#8211;Millay and Teasdale seem lumbering and saccharine in comparison. But Limmer’s <em>Journey Around My Room</em>— which she subtitles a “mosaic” of Bogan’s notebook entries, fragments of an autobiography, and drafts of poems, some collected, some that had previously existed only in manuscript—is a volume of aching beauty, a far more complex and revealing portrait of Bogan than is evidenced in her published verse, and a foundational document of 20th Century feminism. Limmer’s strength as an editor is a gift for surprising but sensible juxtapositions; the entries, maxims, and poems are not beholden to chronology, but Limmer eschews the uncomfortable one-upmanship that so troubles us about <em>Straw for the Fire. </em>In the following entry, Bogan both belittles and aggrandizes her habit of notebook-keeping:</p>
<blockquote><p>The keeping of a journal may become a futile and time-wasting occupation for a writer. Temptation toward the inconsequential detail, the vaporous idea, and the self-regarding emotion are always present and can become overwhelming. But whatever I do, apart from the short cry (lyric poetry) and the short remark (journalism) must be in the form of notes. Mine is the talent of the cry or the <em>cahier.</em><a href="#13"><sup>13</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Yet this entry is directly followed by a passage on the nature of time and longing that has a gracefulness and psychological wisdom that rivals Proust:</p>
<blockquote><p>“My time will come,” you say to yourself, but how can you know whether your time has not already come, and gone? Perhaps one afternoon the verandah in Panama, with the Barbadians whetting their sickles on the hill below, the Chinese gardens green, the noise of the breakers beyond the hill below, the crochet in your lap, and the cool room shuttered and the sheered bed—perhaps that was your time. (But it was too early.) Or mornings in the sunny room in Boston, when the children cried loudly from the public school across the way, “A prairie is a <em>grassy</em> plain,” and you sat on the low couch with your books and papers about you, happy and safe and calm: perhaps your time was then.  (But you didn’t see it at all.) Perhaps it has been spent, all spent, in streetcars, drinking gin, smoking cigarettes—in connubial love, in thousands of books devoured by the eye, in eating, sewing, in suspicions, tears, jealousy, hatred, and fear. Perhaps it is now, on a dark day in October, in the bedroom where you sit with emptiness in your body and heart; beside the small fire, drying your hair—older, more tired, desperately silent, unhappily alone, with faith and daydreams (perhaps luckily) broken and disappearing, with the dreadful pain in your shoulder which presages dissolution, infection, and age. Perhaps this very instant is your time—pretty late—but still your own, your peculiar, your promised and presaged moment, out of all moments forever.<a href="#14"><sup>14</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Typing this, I am dumbfounded by the absolute mastery of Bogan’s prose rhythms. How can she shift so seamlessly from densely lapidary description to the most heart-rending bald directness?  The phrasing, the very punctuation, is immaculate. Yet this is also <em>improvised</em>, someone jotting in a notebook a “cry” that she has just belittled as lachrymose. Limmer has stage-managed all this, but you can’t read the two passages without bowing down before a sensibility and talent which none of us can come close to matching.  Could Bogan have done this had she access to the “daily journal” function on Outlook, or on one of those dinky laptops the size of postage stamps that are now all the rage with my students? I wonder.  Nor would this have been possible, I daresay, as a blog post on <a href="http://louboganthecrier.com/">http://louboganthecrier.com</a>. (“My time will come u say 2 urself, bt can u know whether yr time is gone…WTF?!”) But mostly I marvel at Bogan’s artistry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to close with a brief look at two recently published poets’ notebooks that seem to me of the first order, the equals of Char, Seferis, and Bogan.  One is a poet whose opinions about notebooks we already know: Charles Simic, whose <em>The Monster Loves His Labyrinth</em> is  evidence of a formidable poet writing at his full powers. I have to confess to mixed feelings about Simic’s verse; the best of it is indispensable, but much of it seems written on automatic pilot; the mystery, genius with metaphor, and baffled sense of the world as an immense oxymoron devolves in the lesser poems into mere whimsy and self-imitation. I find Simic’s prose more consistent; his  books in the Michigan Poets on Poetry series depart from the series norm of bottom-of-the drawer occasional prose and are substantial pieces of writing, both the autobiographical sketches and the essays on contemporary poetry. These latter pieces, which often appear in the <em>New York Review of Books,</em> show Simic to be perhaps our best poetry reviewer since Jarrell. And I should also mention Simic’s <em>Dime Store Alchemy</em>, a series of meditations on the boxes of Joseph Cornell that leaves most of the work on Cornell by art historians in the dust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The maxims, parables, scraps of verse, one-liners and absurdist parables of <em>The Monster Loves His Labyrinth </em>manage to combine the quizzical imagination of Simic’s poetry with the searching intelligence of his prose; the hybrid genre of the notebook is in several keys ways the ideal mode for Simic’s unique sensibility. Having been born in the former Yugoslavia on the verge of World War II, but coming of age in Chicago, Simic has always been a poet whose Eastern European irony and cultivation fuses with a deep appreciation of the American vernacular and equally deep intolerance for our various national hypocrisies. Although he dwells on the cusp between two cultures, the mixture has never seemed a strained or unnatural one. The mix is abundantly in evidence in one of the book’s first entries, which is funny and savage by turns:</p>
<blockquote><p>I didn’t tell you how I got lice wearing a German helmet. This used to be a famous story in our family. I remember those winter evenings just after the War with everyone huddled around the stove, talking and worrying late into the night. Sooner or later, it was inevitable, someone would bring up my German helmet full of lice. They thought it was the funniest thing they ever heard. Old people had tears of laughter in their eyes. A kid dumb enough to walk around with a German helmet full of lice. They were crawling all over it. Any fool could see them!</p>
<p>I sat there saying nothing, pretending to be equally amused,  nodding my head while thinking to myself,  what a bunch of idiots! All of them. They had no idea how I got the helmet, and I wasn’t about to tell them,  It was one of those first days just after the liberation of Belgrade, I was in the old cemetery with a few friends, just kind of snooping around. A couple of German solders, obviously dead, lay stretched on the ground. We drew closer for a better look. They had no weapons. Their boots were gone, but there was a helmet that had fallen to the side of one of them. I don’t know what the others got, but I went for the helmet. I tiptoed so as not to wake the dead man.  I also kept my eyes averted. I never saw his face, even if I sometimes think I did.  Everything else about that moment is still intensely clear to me.</p>
<p>That’s the story of the helmet full of lice.<a href="#15"><sup>15</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole passage dwells within various liminal places:  are these the rhythms of prose or of poetry? They’re flawless either way. The prose is transcultural,  veering from a language distinctly East European&#8211;the second paragraph has the parable-like phrasing of Isaac Bashevis Singer—to the pure Huck Finn Americana we get when the child Simic purloins the helmet:  “I was in the old cemetery with a few friends, just snooping around.”  And of course this is funny as hell and tragic: what is a dead man? The source of a trophy, a souvenir, a toy. But the dead man also retains some powerful mojo: don’t look him in the face, whatever you do, and if you desecrate his resting place, a kind of King Tut’s Curse will follow. Imagine little Charles, triumphantly affixing the Wehrmacht helmet to his head: it’s way too big; it slides down toward his chin, even as he tightens the strap. And how hungry those lice must have been, having sucked every drop of the blood of the dead private’s scalp some days ago.  Yet this riotous mixture ends on a different and unexpected note, asking some of the most vexing questions about the nature of memory itself: “I never saw his face, even if sometimes I think I did. Everything else about that moment is intensely clear to me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much of the book’s first section dwells upon Simic’s similarly grostesque episodes from his Serbian childhood and his immigrant’s consternation at American culture, especially as seen from the vantage point of what seems an endless series of shitty menial jobs, jobs that offer opportunities for Grand Guignol theatrics every bit as unhinging as the helmet story. Yet Simic always mixes his absurdities with tenderness. Near the end of the section, he offers this entry:</p>
<blockquote><p>The face of my daughter lit by a table lamp while she sucks a finger pricked by a compass. A drop of blood already fallen on the black letters and numerals of the difficult homework, as she worries to hand it in, just as it is, to the stern old nun who’ll make her stand in front of the class waiting for the verdict…The spring day bright with sunlight. The nun’s small dark fist clouding the answer.<a href="#16"><sup>16</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The Monster Loves His Labyrinth</em> is divided by Simic into five sections, one largely autobiographical, another devoted (mainly) to thoughts on the art of poetry and literary reputation, another primarily aphoristic (showcasing the writer’s signature gallows humor) and a final section concerned primarily with aging.  <em> </em>The volume, like a good book of poems, takes pains to see that these thematic categories aren’t too rigid, as the placement of the passage above attests. (And, for what it’s worth, there’s an hilarious passage in the book about Simic showing his early poems to Louise Bogan….) Good writers’ notebooks are partly a display of literary chops, partly a glimpse into the author’s mind and writing process, partly a form of wisdom literature. Simic’s <em>Monster</em> is all of these. Reading it is a great delight, enough so that it makes me want to read all of Simic—both the poetry and the prose—another time, this time equipped with  a more discerning sense of what his mission really is.</p>
<p><em>Monster </em>was published within a few months of Stephen Cope’s edition of George Oppen’s  <em>Selected Prose, Daybooks, and Papers.</em> You couldn’t encounter two writers who are more different. Simic is composed of irony, contradiction, guffaws, and sudden flashes of pathos. Oppen is, with the possible exception of Eliot—at least in the work he allowed to be published and not the King Bolo and suchlike material; not the un-Eliotic <em>Triumph of Bullshit</em>—the most humorless of America’s great poets. But <em>great</em> Oppen surely is, and if you have any doubts about Oppen’s importance the Daybooks will convert you. And, what’s more, <em>The Daybooks </em>are physically, formally, and temperamentally unique documents, completely so. Although he is usually lumped with the Objectivist School of poets, and maintained long literary friendships with Louis Zukofsky and Charles Reiznikoff, Cope rightly characterizes Oppen as the essential American “iconoclast,” not a member of a school but a party of one. He may share with the other Objecitivsts an obsession for clarity of expression and a fastidiously laconic method;  he also shared their social consciousness, but whereas the leftism of Zukofsky seems merely literary, Oppen was the genuine article.  As a labor organizer and a Communist Party member, Oppen paid a price for his social activism, and his writing paid a price for it too. Not long after publishing his first collection in 1934, Oppen voluntarily undertook a poetic silence that lasted almost twenty-five years, feeling that the writing was at odds with his political organizing. He fought in the infantry in World War II, and when his political affinities imperiled him during the McCarthy era, he spent a good many years in a kind of semi-voluntary exile in Mexico. Oppen’s return to writing poetry coincided with his return to the United States in 1958 and a shift from doctrinaire Marxism to an unaffiliated leftism. In the ‘60s he enjoyed his most productive period, publishing three collections, among them the Pulitzer-prizewinning <em>Of Being Numerous </em>in 1968, one of the key long poems of our time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oppen began keeping his <em>Daybooks</em> around the time of his return to the States, and though they are undated, his five extant daybooks seem to have occupied him for some fifteen years, until shortly before the onset of the Alzheimer’s that eventually silenced him. The daybooks are typed but contain extensive handwritten notes and corrections—they seem to have begun in improvisation but kept evolving—not with an eye toward publication, but toward a quintessentially Oppen-ish clarity. It’s possible that Oppen worked on more than one of the daybooks at the same time. As the facsimiles of some of the manuscript pages included in Cope’s edition attest, the daybooks were odd-looking affairs, “makeshift books bound by Oppen using various ready-to-hand materials (pipe stem cleaners, nails and wood, paste, glue.”  17 They sometimes contain passages and phrases which also appear in Oppen’s published poetry, but in key respects they are an entity of their own, the place where this most thoughtful of poets kept honing his thoughts, and consequently Cope has developed a highly elaborate—but still quite readable—system for replicating passages of Oppen’s strike-outs and handwritten revisions, for passages he later underscores or sets off for special emphasis, etc. We get, in other words, the down and dirty of intellectual endeavor as it morphs to lyric endeavor, sometimes in statements and pensees, sometimes in passages of verse, sometimes in combinations of the two. What is Oppen’s general goal in the project? Again and again, it seems to be the fundamental problem of getting at truth through the means of the general unshapely-ness and untrustworthiness of words. Most of  us think about this problem, but unlike so many of his modernist predecessors, Oppen was skeptical of any synthesizing system of aesthetic principles; this famously modest writer saw such systems less as philosophies than as displays of hubris. At one point in the daybooks, for example,  he suggests we can do without Wallace Stevens and his supreme fictions. For Oppen, the struggle is more fraught than that, as this passage so well illustrates:</p>
<blockquote><p>The poem: correcting, one hears a word or a line as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">wrong,</span> as against some idea of the good, the perfect—Correcting word by word, line by line, toward a concept which you hold and never experience?</p>
<p>The music of the poem does seem to be “out there,” extant—<br />
the sound toward which you are working<br />
But why in the mind? Where most clearly it is</p>
<p>Newton: the moment of excitement was the grasp of necessary truth. And the thought: I AM SAYING WORDS TO MYSELF BUT THOSE WORDS MUST REPRESENT THE TRUTH OF THINGS OUT THERE WHERE I HAVE NEVER BEEN AND CAN NEVER BE</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That words must be true, the syntax must work!  And words, something one has learned as an infant, something the nurse used&#8211;! They can be constructed like number into <em>necessary truth!</em></p>
<p>Of the transcendental truth some things come—well, floating down in fragments like leaves of a tree&#8211;.As, numbers, which seem to act on necessary truth. <em>Do words? Do we lack a transfixitive syntax?<a href="#18"><sup>18</sup></a></em></p></blockquote>
<p>It’s the same relentlessly earnest and deeply sober depth of speculation that readers familiar with Oppen’s poetry know so well. But whereas the poems seem chiseled by their ideas, the daybooks seem to genuinely <em>worry</em> over them. More than many of his generational peers, Oppen was highly read in 20<sup>th</sup> Century European philosophy, especially Heidegger and Wittgenstein. Like Wittgenstein, Oppen’s preferred stance is skepticism, and his preferred mode is minimalist. But the searching and quizzical tone of the daybooks is far different from Wittgenstein’s maddeningly lapidary aloofness. And even at his most philosophical, Oppen, unlike the apolitical Wittgenstein, insists that the problems of philosophy and writing are also problems involving the need for social justice:</p>
<p>My “symbols”—I do not quite agree that they are symbols. The man who holds in his mind some rare thing—a crocus, an owl—and uses it to state a meaning has indeed found himself a symbol. But I speak of the things I see, and that I see everyday, because my life is lead among them, because I have no life free from them, and must obviously find meaning in them, if I am to find meaning. <em>at all.</em><a href="#19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>This brings to mind the stunning 27<sup>th</sup> section of <em>Of Being Numerous. </em></p>
<blockquote><p>It is difficult now to speak of poetry—</p>
<p>About those who have recognized the range of choice or those who have lived the life they were born to&#8211;.It is not precisely a question of profundity but of a different order of experience. One would have to tell what happens in a life, what choices present themselves, what the world is for us, what happens in time, what thought is in the course of a life, and therefore what art is, and the isolation of the actual.</p>
<p>I would want to talk of rooms and of what they look out on and of basements, the rough walls bearing the marks of the forms, the old marks of wood in the concrete, such solitude as we know—</p>
<p>And the swept floors. Someone, a workman bearing about him, feeling about him that particular wordlike a dishonored fatherhood he has swept away this solitary floor, this profoundly hidden floor—such solitude as we know.</p>
<p>One must not come to feel that he has a thousand threads in his hands.<br />
He must somehow seem the one thing;<br />
This is the level of art.<br />
There are other levels<br />
But there is no other level of art.<a href="#20"><sup>20</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oppen’s <em> Daybooks</em> start in such strata, in their acceptance of the fact that we build our writing lives out of an essential unknowing. Yet we are blessed to also begin this process upon some foundation that may be ancient and neglected, but which is also ultimately sound and communal: the level of art. That place underground may not be the landfill or the town dump, after all; it may instead be the buried palace walls, the flattened ramparts of an ancient city, the Mycenae where Schliemann, slogging in the mud, suddenly lifts up the hammered golden mask of Agamemnon. The place where it all has ended so that it all may start again. Our notebooks, I would submit, are the closest material things we have that replicate such places, where we get on our knees and dig into the mud with our hands, where we sweep away the “solitary hidden floor,” where Hypnos stays up long into the night, cleaning his weapon by oil-lamp, then filling another leaf of his album; where  Louise Bogan tells us she knows why the Ninth Circle of Hell is icy because she “has laid her living hand upon it”; where a certain Monster within a certain Labyrinth marvels at the fact that he doesn’t believe in God but is still “afraid of opening an umbrella in the house” ; and where, to our eternal good fortunate, a serious young man&#8211;who does believe in God&#8211;keeps trying to hypnotize a duck.</p>

<p>The aching muscles of my calves began to tremble just as the forest broke away. A white river threaded the valley floor far below. I turned to the right and above the tips of pine emerged the Sümela Monastery. This windowed building of six stories—seamlessly carved out of sheer rock—opened to the sky, its arched doorways shrouded in cloud I had perceived as mist from far below.</p>
<p>In 1930, a fire gutted the library, guest rooms, courtyards, church, and monk housing. It was only seven years after the new Turkish government relocated local Orthodox Greeks to Greece. Among the skeletal wall-remains, 1200 meters above sea level, tourists appeared and disappeared; secured to their heads were hardhats the color of lemons, an illusion of safety amid falling rock and slippery walkways.</p>
<p>The clash of the mountain panorama and cliff-side building amplified as I walked among the monastery’s dissolving walls. Graffiti-carved names—Nurten, Yavir, and Nebile—looked like words of prayer. On the interiors of some walls, sun and wind peeled the paint off frescoes even as I studied them. Cut out sections revealed layers of plaster over rough stone. Vandals gouged out saints’ eyes on paintings within arm’s reach. In one, too high for violence, the hand of Jesus compelled Lazarus’s body from an open tomb. And was this Mary, head halo-wrapped, body cloaked in red? At her center, the infant Jesus holding his arms out in blessing. The walls of my childhood church seemed to rise up, and I felt awe just as I did praying before the fourth station of the cross, the priest’s words <em>Jesus meets his mother</em> in my ears.</p>
<p>I stood within these stories overwhelmed by an interior of debris: desire, conception, death, and resurrection held together in stone even as that stone decayed. How was I to know then that the icon—the Black Madonna—serene in her wall niche, was missing? Mary and I gazed at each other with serious eyes, and I searched through a jumble of stories, time and space blurring—a choice to look for the woman inside.</p>
<p align="center">* * *</p>
<p>Trabzon: our school’s-out destination. Neither Chad, my boyfriend, nor I had traipsed across northeastern Turkey yet. With my two-year teaching stint in Tarsus complete, I planned to unwind from an exhausting semester before returning to the States for graduate school. Only halfway through his contract, Chad would be back in Turkey in August. I hoped our time alone would strengthen our relationship before the “long distance” phase.</p>
<p>We walked across tarmac toward a twenty-seater airplane, scarlet-lettered <em>Bodrum</em> emblazoned upon its white paint. A colleague of ours nicknamed Bodrum “Bed Room:” a place to swim, barhop, and seduce tourists. A rather sinful city.</p>
<p>“That’s hilarious. We’re flying to Trabzon in the <em>Bodrum</em>,” I said to Chad, reaching for his hand. “It’s like flying to Las Vegas in the <em>Chastity</em>. Instead of beaches and bars, we’ll be touring Orthodox churches.”</p>
<p>He smiled and slung his arm around my backpack.</p>
<p>I pictured the Sümela monastery, named for a Greek word stemming from “dark” or “black.” Later I would learn about the Black Madonna icon and ponder the incongruity of her slender, European nose and thin lips with her black hair and dark skin. Like all Black Madonnas, her contrasting features inspired conjecture. Centuries of stories, deposited within the vessel of Mary’s body, shifted over time.</p>
<p>Chad sighed and stretched out, staring at the seatback in front of him. I read this as preoccupation, as invitation to initiate conversation. Nearby a passenger shoved a duffel bag into an overhead bin; others squeezed themselves between armrests. I pulled out the seat belt and buckled it across my waist.</p>
<p>“Hey. I’m sure I’m not,” I said to Chad. “I shouldn’t have mentioned I was late until I knew for sure. But if you keep being worried, you’ll make me worried.” I tried to catch his eye.</p>
<p>“We’re always safe, but you said you’re never this late.” Did he think I was lying? “Let’s not talk about this right now.” He pulled out a book from his bag.</p>
<p>The flight attendant’s ring glinted as she set the tea down on the mini-tray on my lap. I plunked a sugar cube into my glass, a tiny vase curved like a woman’s body. The grains of sugar broke free and floated up before merging into the steaming sienna tea. One of my hands drifted to my flat belly, the other to the rim of the glass.</p>
<p>“It’s probably stress,” I said. “If I don’t obsess about it, it’ll come. Besides, this is our <em>vacation</em>. Just the two of us.”</p>
<p>His answer: a squeeze of my hand before opening the book.</p>
<p>I interpreted this as affirmation. As I sipped the hot tea my mind turned the kaleidoscope of possibilities. A half-inch twist changed the geometric slips of paper—me, Chad, school, one year’s time—from a mandala of jewels into an aqua and russet burst, one version of the story. Another? Twelve years of Catholic school burned The Visitation behind my eyes. I imagine Mary’s hair as the color of walnuts. Cooking lamb, she tucks a stray curl under her hair covering and lapses into a daydream about a cute neighbor. Gabriel drops by; her kaleidoscope turns.</p>
<p>“God’s tapped you,” the angel explains. “What do you say?” She’s given a choice and thinks about it, but scripture doesn’t convey silence well. Her “yes” inverts the shape of her future. She could’ve said no.</p>
<p>Minus the angel and miraculous conception, I thought when faced with pregnancy, I’d watch mirrors and light blur the colors before me. I’d search for an answer within.</p>
<p align="center">* * *</p>
<p>With no summit of the Zigana Mountains to inspire us yet, Chad and I trekked the path snaking through the forest. The saturated air infused each deep breath with the scent of pine and slowed my pace. Tight from travel, my muscles strained to push, and I negotiated the curves of the steep ascension with care. Chad’s muscles, remembering thousands of bouldering hikes, propelled him with ease, yet sweat trickled down his neck. After an hour, my t-shirt and jeans stuck to my skin; I wished I had braved shorts despite the stares of disapproval I’d receive. The narrowed eyes of men always conjured fragments of a memory: a man’s hand on my shoulder; a wall closing in; my fingers squeezing his throat; his feet hitting pavement. I still breathed through the anger and fear summoned by memories of this attempted attack. With my blonde hair and blue eyes, had he assumed I was a “Natasha”—a Russian sex worker?</p>
<p>Our steps regularized as the forest thickened, the canopy of leaves shielding us from direct sun. Partway up, Chad and I veered off the main trail and followed an overgrown dirt path. It ended at ruins. We rested on a chunk of stone and sipped from water bottles. The smell of the crumbling house—two partial walls and pile of stacked rubble—was a blend of mold and piss. Perhaps this dwelling had once sheltered pilgrims seeking Sümela’s sacred springs. According to legend, the Black Madonna asked angels to remove her icon from Athens where Saint Luke had sent his painting. Mary chose this mountain and she created a place of healing.</p>
<p>Back on the dusty trail, I focused on my walking sandals, one step in front of the other. Every few minutes I caught a glimpse of a brown trunk swathed in moss or a branch veiled in leaves of translucent green, each leaf a halo of light.</p>
<p align="center">* * *</p>
<p>Chad and I had trouble finding a hotel in Trabzon. On the outside we were tourists—good business—but once hotel clerks opened our Turkish work permits (they designated our status as teachers which often meant cheaper prices) and studied the inside, they read a different story. The permit marked us “single,” but we asked for one room. They scrutinized me, listening to my clumsy Turkish. “No vacancy,” they finally said, snapping the permits shut.</p>
<p>I doubted them. The number of Natashas in Trabzon reinforced their stereotypes of non-Turkish women. I had become accustomed to, although never comfortable with, Turkish men glancing at my short blonde hair and blue eyes and asking me for sex. Walking home from the market, a sack of tomatoes and carrots in my arms, I would pass a small group of men leaning against a wall and smoking cigarettes. Avoiding eye contact that might “invite” a remark, I stared at the back of women’s tight ponytails or fringed headscarves. I imagine one of the smokers noticed my hair first. He probably elbowed his friend. Taking a drag of his cigarette, he would exhale: “Hello, Natasha” followed by a flurry of Turkish. The first month I blushed; the second I glared even though it amused them. When their “Hey, Natasha, Natasha” faded, my neck relaxed, shoulders softened, and pace slowed. I marched faster if one followed me for several blocks. I tried to ignore the ways men interpreted my exterior, the stories they assumed from the color of my hair and eyes.</p>
<p>We secured a hotel room after two proprietors refused us. Nestled among a series of red-shingled businesses, Hotel Nur topped a deeply sloping street. Two steep flights of stairs ended with our room. Once inside the door, Chad took four steps and stood in front of a nightstand between twin beds. The angle of light, streaming from a window, illuminated the thickness of his body, corded muscles from rock climbing softened by slight cushioning—the result of his own great cooking. I dropped my backpack on the right bed and pushed open the only other door. The closet-sized bathroom was just the right size for a saint’s niche. I could imagine Mary Magdalene—from a fresco featured in my guidebook—smoothing out her hair in the mirror. Her elongated fingers and neck, pale cheeks, and somber expression created a version of this woman I didn’t recognize; I always imagined her as curvy, a bit plump even, with knowing eyes, thick, loose hair, and a slight smile on her lips.</p>
<p>Only my head reflected in the mirror above the basin as I washed my hands and face. When I opened the door, Chad stood there, a pregnancy test in his hand.</p>
<p>“Where’d you get this?” I asked, touching the corner of the box.</p>
<p>“Lisa had one and gave it to me before we left.”</p>
<p>My hand recoiled. “You told her?” I wondered how many other friends knew about this possibility.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well I was worried that you’d be worried.”</p>
<p>“I’m not,” I replied, folding my arms in front of me.</p>
<p align="center">* * *</p>
<p>I put off the test by suggesting dinner. At the restaurant a case of fresh <em>alabalık</em> laid out on crushed ice greeted us, reminding me of my father’s autumn catches of trout in the cold streams of northern Iowa. We pointed to two we wanted and ordered tomato and cucumber salad, pita, and lentil soup. I placed a napkin over the head of my fish; its blank, watching eye bothered me as I separated meat from bones. Chad chatted about his plans to leave in three days for the States. I would travel alone for another week before meeting a friend in Istanbul and sightseeing for two weeks with her.</p>
<p>“Do you have to go back this week? Maybe you could change your departure date and go back when I meet Melissa.”</p>
<p>“That would be impossible. I’ve been planning a summer of mountain-climbing and beer-drinking for months.”</p>
<p>I don’t remember the rest of our conversation or if there was one.</p>
<p>When we returned to Hotel Nur, an actual Natasha—the first I’d seen—lingered a few doors down from the entrance. Her body was lean, all angles, especially the way her knees jutted out of her orange mini skirt. The only curve I could see was the curl of her bobbed platinum hair.</p>
<p>Chad insisted on the test. The sun made the burnt-red rooftops shimmer as I turned from him and stepped into the bathroom. His way, I figured, would produce an answer. Clarify things. I eased onto my haunches and balanced over a porcelain hole with cup in hand. Through the crack in the door I heard the call to prayer, and afterwards, a Russian voice arguing with someone on the street below our room.</p>
<p>When Mary Magdalene crashed Jesus’ dinner party, he recognized a fellow healer, one who could soothe with her caress. He touched her chin as she perfumed his feet with oil and turned her face up to his. “Things change,” he said when they were eye to eye. “Come with me. I’ll never leave you alone.”  The next day I would see a fresco of Mary Magdalene with regret painted in her eyes.  She would appear to weep into my hair from the ceiling.</p>
<p>I peed, then handed Chad the stick still wet with urine.</p>
<p align="center">* * *</p>
<p>I wish I could say I saw Sümela’s Black Madonna when I explored the monastery, but her image painted on cracked black wood and framed in eighteenth-century silver metalwork had disappeared. Maybe she resembled Our Lady of Jasna Gora: almond-shaped eyes half closed; a svelte nose lengthening her oval face; complexion the color of coffee with cream; a halo setting off the gold borders of her headpiece. Would her image have inspired me to wash my hands in her sacred spring or put the water to my lips? Perhaps I would have felt a sudden lift of spirit, a tingling from head to toe. I would have been able to step back from my life and trust everything would turn out okay.</p>
<p>Instead, I found stories of Black Madonnas long after my relationship with Chad was over. Two days after the hike, backpack slung over his arm, he climbed onto the airport bus. I waited for him to turn around, to change his mind. His bus roared away, the tires churning up a cloud of dust. On the outside our relationship wasn’t over—and wouldn’t be for another year—but on some level we’d both abandoned it.</p>
<p>I traveled west along the Black Sea following a route the spiritual descendants of Barnabus and Sophronius, the hermits credited with bringing Sümela’s Black Madonna to Anatolia. After the monastery was founded, the two traveled throughout Anatolia, the Balkans, and Russia to sell copies of their famous icon. In Sinop I said a prayer at St. Anne’s, the church of Mary’s mother, whose image time had transformed into a winged figure without a face. Alone in Safronbolu, I rambled into quiet neighborhoods where I watched women hang rugs on clotheslines and sweep stone steps.  Sometimes I stood on the side of a street to watch people sauntering by, worries or hope mapped on their faces. The breeze orchestrated their voices into a medley, tuning into my heartbeat, and I dissolved into the current for a moment.</p>
<p>Some scholars conjecture that artists darkened Mary’s image to illustrate a text from the Song of Songs: “I am black and beautiful;” others associate Black Madonnas with ancient earth goddesses; others say they express a feminine power not fully conveyed by a pale-skinned Mary and link them to Mary Magdalene. Perhaps the painter never intended her to be a “Black Madonna” and soot from centuries of burning candles turned her pigment dark. Perhaps she ended up so many miles from home by accident, a wrinkle in her predestined story. Perhaps she felt obliged to say yes. Perhaps the ways men looked at her fueled her desire to seek shelter—any shelter.</p>
<p>Sümela’s Black Madonna never appeared to me on that hike. She was gone. Or she was everywhere. Inside the monastery, hues of paintings lightened only to be darkened again by shadows of passing clouds. Stones crumbled underfoot—the possibilities in narratives conceived. And that interior debris, what’s left of desire, shifted. I wonder if Mary would choose, as I have, the stories that sustain her. I wonder if she would exist, as I have, in the spaces that they blur.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I suited up for Little League at age ten, shrugging into a maroon nylon top and pulling on my gleaming white pants rimmed with thick elastic at the waist, I distinguished myself by carrying a wooden bat to the plate. It was a thirty-two inch Worth cut from a blonde ash tree, and with its thick handle and barrel it likely weighed at least two or three pounds. This was an odd choice for a Little Leaguer, since lightweight metal bats had more pop and far more durability. But I was a purist. Wood was what the pros used, the kind of bat that met the ball with a gut-tingling crack, unlike the ping of aluminum, which sounded more like a sound effect on a video game than a good, honest hit. I knew my bat could break, and every time I caught a pitch off the tip or close to the handle, the vibration stung my hands. But when I found the sweet spot, when a pitch came in at belt level and I got good wood on it, the shock washed over my whole body like I’d jumped into a lake.</p>
<p>I needed that feeling for more reasons than I could express, and I gave it my whole attention, the way I forgot everything else while eating huckleberry cheesecake. It was a form of love, that sweet contact, like the bliss I’d seen on other people’s faces in church, hands raised skyward, tears streaming down their upturned cheeks. And when I knew the ball would clear the fence, when I saw the pitch fly from the barrel and felt the echo in my chest and <em>knew</em>, it was a form of truth.</p>
<p>Baseball was my father’s game, one of the few things we had in common and the only exception he made to banning television from our home. Every fall when the World Series began, he borrowed an old black and white set from my grandfather, and we propped it on a chair in the living room, where we fussed with the antennae until the grainy picture snapped into focus. It was there on the calico rug, lying on my belly with my chin in my hands, that I watched my team, the Mets, win the 1986 World Series. And two years later on the same tiny screen I saw Kirk Gibson hobble to the plate for the Dodgers, my father’s team, and launch a game-winning home run against the Oakland Athletics despite a pulled hamstring and aching knees. For a few moments as Gibson limped around the bases and we jumped on the dining room linoleum to high-five each other, dishes rattling in the cupboard, my father and I were one. He coached each of my teams from the pee-wee league through Babe Ruth, managing even the All-Star teams. Every time I stepped to the plate, I could feel him watching from the third base coach’s box, and I wanted to get that feeling back, knowing if I hit a line drive or a long ball, all my errors would be forgiven and he’d give my shoulder a squeeze.</p>
<p>There was no way for me to know when we first began playing catch on our lawn around my fourth or fifth birthday that my father was trying to get back something he’d lost. But in the next few years, as I started tee-ball and he began grooming me for Little League, I knew he expected more than I could give. He often urged me to throw harder, frustrated by my noodle arm, but arm strength is one of the raw talents only nature bestows, so my earliest memories of catch are laced with a sense of struggle against my body, against myself. Our yard was a steep hillside flanked by an apple orchard and a vegetable garden, an excellent sledding hill in the winter but a poor stand-in for a baseball field with its uneven footing. More often than not, I tripped over my own feet while trying to get under a pop fly that my father tossed overhead, losing my bearings while running uphill. The grounders he threw came at me like curveballs, angling downhill as they bounced my way. My errant throws, which increased the more he hollered for me to put some heart into it, usually landed in a bank of tall grass behind the raspberry canes. My father was not a patient man, and the longer it took to hunt for a lost ball the sharper his return throw would be, increasing the odds that I’d miss it on a short hop and have to chase it down the hill into the ditch, where a row of birch and fir trees fronted our country road. No matter how angry we’d get or how many minutes we wasted wading through the grass, we kept at it until dusk, calling it quits when the air began to pulse with crickets and we could no longer see. These marathon games of catch, though they often felt like failure, were my father’s best attempts at love. I would later suit up for football and basketball and even dabble in tennis, but there was never any question that my first loyalty lay with my father’s game.</p>
<p>He was a second baseman, small for his age as a child and still short as a man, though his chest and arms filled out enough to give him power at the plate. After dropping out of junior college in Arizona, where he’d gone to play baseball and failed to make the cut, he transferred back to Montana to study civil engineering. Schooled in the science of land surveying and longhand drafting, he was more at home with a stack of maps and a calculator than with a novel. He read the Bible aloud every day before dinner, a chapter at a time, in the same methodical way he wiped the table down after we finished the meal, yet faith was more than ritual to him. He’d been swept up in the Jesus People revival in Seattle, where he learned to speak in tongues, a form of ecstatic utterance some Christians believed allowed the Holy Spirit to take control of a person and speak through them in other languages. I struggled to reconcile my meticulous father, the man who triple checked his calculations after packing his yellow surveying tripod around the perimeter of a property boundary, with the man who could surrender control of his own tongue and speak in a stream of what sounded like gibberish to me.</p>
<p>Our church was the kind with loud preaching and dancing and tambourines jingle-jangling through the worship service. We gathered in an abandoned Forest Service building on a hill overlooking the town of Troy, a space we shared with a Catholic church which met early in the morning and dispersed an hour before we arrived to set up a hundred metal folding chairs in a half moon, facing a piano and a large screen where the words to our worship songs appeared, magnified and bathed in light.  It was there I heard stories about revival meetings where a woman with the gift of tongues might speak in Chinese, not understanding a word coming out of her own mouth, learning after the service that a man from the Sichuan Province had heard God speaking directly to him, in his native dialect, in her voice. It was frightening to imagine the voice of God rumbling through my own vocal chords, but it seemed like a super power, a way for the body to feel proof of what the spirit believed. I clapped and sang along with the others, waiting for the spirit to take possession of me, but this seemed beyond my strength, like the games of catch in the backyard, where I could never quite throw hard enough.</p>
<p>The sermons at the Troy Christian Fellowship were much like my father’s coaching, impatient with mediocrity, constantly calling us to higher living. One morning the preacher worked himself into a sweat, pacing before us as if the church were a giant dugout, our buttocks clenched against the hard chairs. There was no stage, and he was not a tall man, but he seemed to tower above us. His text was the book of Exodus, where God delivers the Israelites from bondage in Egypt and calls Moses up Mount Sinai to receive the commandments the people are to live by. “Thou shalt have no other gods before me,” the preacher quoted from memory, his voice rising to a shout as he finished the verse, “for I the Lord thy God am a <em>jealous</em> God.” He stopped to let the words sink in, a vein bulging from his shiny forehead as he stared us down. He went on to tell the story of the golden calf, how even as Moses stood on the mountain receiving the bedrock of Hebrew law directly from the mouth of God, the people grew impatient and melted their own earrings and made a golden calf, which they worshiped as the god that had brought them out of slavery.</p>
<p>“Imagine,” the preacher hissed, his voice fallen into a whisper, “Imagine yourself as a father who has brought up his child in the truth, only to watch him turn away, only to watch him destroy his life at the card table or cast all his passion into gathering riches or grow so proud with learning that he says, ‘There is no God.’” The preacher clutched his Bible to his chest and crouched as if he’d caught a hard grounder in the groin.</p>
<p>“You would not give up on that child,” the preacher went on, his voice building once more into crescendo, “because the love of a father is a jealous love, jealous for its own flesh and blood the way God is jealous for his chosen ones, ready to let loose his wrath on them if they waver in what they know is the truth.”</p>
<p>I considered myself a believer then, not because I felt at home among the faithful straining forward in their chairs, but because I felt the power of those sermons every week and lived in fear for my soul. I looked at the faces around me on Sunday mornings — women weeping with what seemed to be joy, arms raised as they stood and swayed to the music, men shouting amens to the other men who marched before us possessed by the Word and the Spirit and the great urgency of sharing the bad news of human nature and the good news of God’s chastising rod — and I could not consider myself one of their number, even though I believed. I knew the rules of the game, but as I grew into a man’s body and felt more enraptured by a woman’s bosom bouncing at the front of the church as she shook her tambourine than by the words in the song she sang, it seemed certain I wasn’t helping the team. My father sang with his eyes closed, rocking in his cowboy boots with his hands cupped at his sides as if he were waiting for rain, and my mother pounded out chords on the chipped yellow keys of the upright piano. I believed they had a grip on something real, a sensual spirit force that slipped through my fingers and left me feeling empty and cold as I sang the words on the gleaming screen, watching the tambourine player shake her whole body, breasts bobbing beneath her blue paisley dress.</p>
<p>But when I wrapped my hands around the handle of my wooden bat and ripped a pitch into the outfield, the crack echoing down the barrel into my chest, it was like the voice of God in my throat, and my body and spirit flew together down the baseline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was old enough for Little League, my father drove me to Libby for that year’s draft. Libby was twenty miles away, which meant an hour round-trip most week nights through the summer, but it was worth it because the Libby All-Stars could go all the way to the Little League World Series if they were good enough. Troy had an unsanctioned league, where the uniforms featured business names like Acco Cable and ASARCO, the local silver mine, but in Libby the teams were named for professional clubs, and the draft for rookies – that year’s pool of eligible ten-year-olds – was meant to mimic a major league tryout.</p>
<p>On the day of the draft, all of the coaches gathered at the Libby baseball complex, two adjacent fields sandwiched between the Kootenai River and the railroad tracks. My father and I drove the twenty miles from Troy mostly in silence, my belly awash with excitement when we crunched into the gravel parking lot behind the backstop and joined the crowd. The coaches put us through a series of drills, fielding grounders and flies, playing catch, and taking a little batting practice, and I performed well enough to be one of the top picks, rattling several practice pitches against the chain link fence in the outfield. As in the major leagues, the worst team had first dibs in the draft, and I was dismayed to learn by the end of the evening that I’d been chosen by the Mets. But after the tears wore off and I met my teammates for practice, a group of scrawny boys nearly all smaller than me, I accepted my fate. Though my father played for the Dodgers in Little League and had rooted for the professional team ever since, it was clear my loyalty from then on lay with the Mets, and I began reading the box scores every day for Dwight Gooden and Darryl Strawberry and Ray Knight, counting the days to the postseason, when my grandfather would lend us the little black-and-white box and I’d get to watch the pros at home.</p>
<p>My father began as an assistant coach for the Libby Mets, but after my first year he took over as manager, throwing all of his competitive energy into the team. He had played softball until then, his well-oiled glove gleaming in the closet, where it sat on top of his cleats. He bought his softball cleats a half size small, so he could soften them with mink oil and pack them with shoe stretchers until they fit just right. He wore them to practice to show he meant business, dapper in his grey sweat pants and sleek black shoes as he slapped grounders over the dirt infield.</p>
<p>My mother grew up without a television, and when she and my father married, living in a tipi for a year before building a house on the land they purchased in the Rocky Mountain foothills above Troy, they shared a vision of home as a refuge from the outside world. In our living room the couch and the wooden rocking chair faced the piano, an upright in the German style with braces beneath the keyboard, a thick back panel, and a heavy lid made for holding flowers or clocks or lamps for reading sheet music. The hallway on the main floor featured an inset bookcase, which held the Encyclopedia Britannica Great Books collection and my mother’s eclectic library, Chaim Potok’s <em>The Chosen</em>, Graham Greene’s <em>The Wind in the Willows</em>, James Herriot’s <em>All Creatures Great and Small</em>. My father read the newspaper and the Bible and considered most other reading frivolous, rousting me from my bedroom to pull weeds when I lounged there too long with a book.<em> </em>Baseball was the one crack in the fortress, the one out from garden chores, the only excuse for television to invade the protective bubble of faith and homegrown food and music my parents had created for us.</p>
<p>The God I heard about every Sunday and in the chapters my father read before dinner might have considered baseball a rival deity, a golden calf I worshipped every summer on the field and every fall in front of the television set. And there were times when the spitting and crotch scratching cast a frown over my mother’s face. But this was an open door to the world my father allowed, one vestige from his past he did not surrender to the brave new life on the homestead. So I was allowed to worship the game in my own way, plastering the cement walls of my basement bedroom with photographs of Mookie Wilson and Keith Hernandez and Lenny Dykstra clipped from my grandfather’s castoff <em>Sports Illustrated </em>magazines. As I lay on the bear claw quilt my mother had stitched from old corduroy, gazing at the wall mosaic of my heroes with my hands interlocked behind my head, I dreamed of one day making it to The Show. And in a curious way this was not unlike my hope of heaven, though I gave no thought to the irony of a game – a worldly pleasure – sating my yearning for redemption.</p>
<p>Baseball followed Pentecostal doctrine to a surprising degree. Every game, like a church service, began with a song. The true believers, the faithful who had really laid their lives down in support of the team, were not content to sit idly by in the bleachers. When we were down, they hollered encouragement, and when we were up, boy, they banged on the aluminum bleachers and stomped their feet and carried on like they had religion.</p>
<p>One tenet of Pentecostal belief, which followed the doctrine of immediate revelation – the idea that God could speak directly to the individual – was the notion of spiritual gifts. Speaking in tongues was the most dramatic of these, but my father and mother believed there were Christians with the gift of miraculous healing, the gift of interpreting what others were saying in tongues, the gift of prophecy, the gift of teaching, and many others. Every time I scooped a grounder or steadied myself beneath a fly ball, it was only to get one out closer to my next at-bat, when I could dig into the batter’s box and let my true gift shine. “Don’t leave your light under a bushel,” one verse said, and I strove to obey that command every time I lowered myself into my stance. Everywhere else on the field I was a little above average – decent speed, an adequate arm, steady with the glove. At the plate I was unique, often batting above .700 for the regular season, able to launch pitches well beyond the two hundred foot fences. Our preacher described spiritual gifts as a believer’s full inheritance, recounting how he had prayed for the gift of healing, asking God for his full reward. In church I knew I’d come up short. But on the diamond, the sacred ground I shared with my father, I came into that reward.</p>
<p>Baseball is a team effort, but it is just as much an individual discipline, each fielder enisled in his own thoughts, each batter standing alone at the plate. The solitary togetherness of the sport resonated with the stamina I’d gained while sitting through two-hour long revival meetings, the comfort with my own inner space I’d been encouraged to learn through prayer. Reading was also a natural outgrowth of that life, losing myself for hours in another world between the covers of a novel, and writing would later fulfill a similar urge to the reaching out of prayer, the questioning and the crying out and the inner groping for peace. But as a child nothing made more sense than batting, where my father might be watching from the third base line, and my mother and grandparents might be cheering from the stands, but no one else could take my place between the chalk lines of the batter’s box. It was a meditative place where I stood in a half crouch awaiting the pitcher’s delivery, my back elbow cocked to keep my swing level, hands gripping the bat handle without squeezing too much, my whole body coiled and ready. The pitcher faded in my vision, the chatter from the infielders dimmed, and I waited to see the ball in flight, my legs and arms tightening in the split second before deciding to swing.</p>
<p>In practice I took time to think about keeping the bat level, punching an outside pitch to the opposite field, eyes following the ball straight down to the bat. But in the game I played by instinct, the sudden knowledge of whether a pitch was too high or too low or whether it was slicing in straight across the plate, belt high, in my wheelhouse. When that happened, when I felt the pitch arcing toward the sweet spot, my body twisted forward to meet the ball, arms whipping the wooden bat, eyes fixed on the blur of the pitch. There was a power rising within me, a spirit force welling up. This was my gift. This was my full inheritance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a child I felt these things without naming them, buoyed or weighed down by sudden impressions of joy or guilt rising like vapors from the stew of family life. The elation on my face when the clean shock of the sweet spot rippled up my arms into my chest surely appeared to everyone else as little more than a kid having fun, but the feeling resonated with me as proof of God’s favor, though I could not have explained why. Eric Liddell, the pious sprinter in <em>Chariots of Fire</em>, captured the essence of it when he explained to his sister, “God made me for a purpose, but he also made me fast. And when I run I feel his pleasure.”<em> </em>So when the game went badly, when I let a grounder hop between my legs or fisted a pitch into an easy pop fly, a pall fell over my spirits not unlike the nagging fear that my soul was in peril.</p>
<p>The morning after a game, my father would have forgotten the outcome, good or bad, but I had more difficulty letting go and often sat at the breakfast table in a brooding silence. He tried to make me laugh then, cracking jokes about how it took more energy to frown than to smile, but this only pushed me deeper into gloom, and if I sometimes poured too much maple syrup on my pancakes, it was only as a stand-in for my next chance to step up to home plate and make sweet contact once more.</p>
<p>When I launched a home run and circled the bases with the echo of it still tingling in my hands, my father often said, perhaps to curb my pride, “You’re only as good as your next at-bat.” I took this to heart. It was a literalism I was internalizing in church, a way of sorting the world into the clean and the unclean, trusting rituals of penance to make me whole. Like a prayer for forgiveness, which might wash away my sin for that instant alone, every trip to the plate was a mountaintop where I could not linger, an absolution pitching me back into the valley to climb out again. To my shame I can scarcely remember my teammates, so intent I was on claiming the game as my one true gift, sitting alone in a packed dugout with my wooden bat at my side. Sometimes I held it at arm’s length, studying the waves of the wood grain rippling beneath the blue Worth logo, then twisting the handle and closing one eye so I could track the straight lines of the side grain toward the sweet spot in the middle of the barrel, the place where I belonged, where I wanted to live my whole life.</p>
