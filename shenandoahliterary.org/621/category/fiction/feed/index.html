I saw Melvin Wood, The Tree Man, in Mall Mart while I was buying travel size toiletries for my upcoming Cruise to Nowhere. To keep him from seeing <em>me</em>, I turned to the Athletics Cosmetics display, where a holographic image of Amy Knobloch hovered above the four words that had made her famous.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">SINGLE HANDED<br />
NO EXCUSES</p>
<p>Her penalty kick had won the gold medal game at the last Olympics.  She was a local girl, a mass marketer’s dream—an amputee who’d become a world class athlete and a semifinalist on <em>Pole Dancing with the Stars</em>. Marjorie, my wife, had loved her. At the product launch, she’d lined up for an hour to get Amy’s autograph on a giant bottle of shampoo.</p>
<p>But Melvin recognized me from the back, and he tapped me on the forearm with one of his calloused hands. “Mister Breedlove,” he said. “You betaken a trip?”</p>
<p>I told him I’d be driving to Charleston tomorrow morning to begin a five-day Caribbean cruise.  I didn’t say anything about my Hermetic Vacation package.  Melvin had worked outdoors all his life.</p>
<p>“My tree still doing?”  He pronounced it <em>dune</em>.</p>
<p>Right after I met Melvin on jury duty, ten years ago, he’d come out to Belladonna to prune a big pin oak—the one the Owners’ Association swore couldn’t be saved.  Melvin always referred to it as “his” tree.  “Healthy as ever,” I said.</p>
<p>“And how’s the little lady?”</p>
<p>No way out of that one.  Since I’d been working at my insurance agency on that long-ago weekend, Marjorie had greeted Melvin in the driveway.  When he’d told her that the oak didn’t have to come down, that he hated to kill a live tree, that it was like killing one of his own kids (which he didn’t have), Marjorie knew she’d found a kindred spirit.  After he’d spent a whole day with a hand saw and a bucket of tar for the open wounds, she’d run into him, maybe every other month or so, while she was out grocery shopping.  He’d always ask her for an update on “his” tree.</p>
<p>Now I explained that Marjorie had died of a brain aneurysm, and that she’d been planning our forty-fifth anniversary trip for a whole year.  “She was only sixty-eight.”</p>
<p>Melvin took off his PRIME CUTS cap and put it over the pocket of his flannel shirt.   His grizzled beard wobbled with grief.  “Fifty years I been at this job,” he said.  “And she was the only lady ever in-vite me inside her own home, to sit down with her at her kitchen table.”</p>
<p>“She’d want me to take the trip,” I said.  “Especially since she’s already paid for it.”</p>
<p>“Little lady knew the value of a dollar,” Melvin agreed.  He scratched his bare head with his big knuckles.  “Never did see her without no coupon in her hand.”</p>
<p>I took out my Yphone and displayed the virtual discounts for my Homeland Security approved sizes of mouthwash, toothpaste, deodorant, and shaving cream.  After we both managed to laugh, Melvin clapped me lightly on my left shoulder.  He told me to have fun.  He told me we weren’t getting any younger.  No sirree.  He told me to enjoy the fresh air and sunshine while I still could.  “Mister Breedlove,” he said, “you come back here looken like one of them mule-lottos.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>After Marjorie died, nearly half of Belladonna rang my front doorbell with something meant to console me.  Lorene Morrison brought a bouquet of Franken Roses from her late husband’s bushes.  Jorja Sorensen hauled over a lump of Perma-Crete that she claimed was the latest installment in her <em>Gone with the Uterus</em> sculpture series.   Meredith Cotten and Jimmy Scheetz solemnly handed me a voucher for a new mattress pad from Ecumenical Bedding.  Peg Carmichael, the wife of the former Bullpens College athletics director, baked me a sheet cake in the shape of a giant football.  The laces were little crosses of white icing, and above them she’d curlicued  <em>Marjorie 68, Satan 0</em></p>
<p>But I wasn’t in any mood to be consoled.  I put the roses through the Disposall, dropped <em>GWT Uterus</em> and the mattress voucher into the garbage can, and carried the sheet cake into the powder room.  I cut it up into cowflop-size pieces and started counting.  By the last flush, Satan was up by a touchdown and an extra point.</p>
<p>When I opened the bathroom closet to get something to scour the rim of the bowl, I saw one of Marjorie’s Post-Its stuck to the inside of the door.</p>
<p>NO INSURANCE<br />
NO EXCUSES</p>
<p>And then I remembered that the Cruise to Nowhere she’d planned—and paid for— would set sail in a week.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Marjorie was quoting Amy Knobloch to me, even from the grave, because I’d been an insurance man all my working life.  We’d never taken a cruise before, and I hate to leave Greenville, so she’d refused to buy TravelGuard.  “Three drops of rain on the windshield and you’ll cancel, Baron.  I <em>know</em> you.  That’s why I booked with Peregrine.”  She led me by the hand to her laptop computer and showed me the itinerary for the Cruise to Nowhere.  Every day was a FUN DAY AT SEA.  “With the Hermetic Vacation package, you’ll never have to step outside,” she said.  I looked at the web page more carefully:  No ports of call, all-indoor amenities, the same table for every dinner, the same cabin every night.  Same bathroom, same bed, same pillow.  Peregrine even had its own underground parking garage in Charleston, with an umbilical cord leading directly to the ship.  I had to admit that it sounded pretty good.  Risk free.  I mean, how could I object to Nowhere?</p>
<p>Marjorie smiled at me, triumphantly.  “Well?”</p>
<p>I kissed the crown of her head.  “Okie-dokie.”</p>
<p>“Remember, Baron,” she’d said.  “It’s already booked.  And it’s non-refundable.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Well, I’d just see about <em>that</em>.  After I’d cleaned the toilet, I found Peregrine’s toll free number and went to the kitchen phone.  We must be the only people in America who still have a land line.  It took me about ten minutes to hack through the phone tree and get a real person.  I explained the situation and said, “I’m sure you can understand where I’m coming from, Sandy.  I don’t need a cruise at this point in my life.”</p>
<p>“When did she die?” the young woman asked.</p>
<p>“Three weeks ago,” I said.</p>
<p>“Well, you’ve just got to get out there!”</p>
<p>Retired insurance agents don’t surprise easily.  “Indeed.”</p>
<p>“I’m a psychology major,” she said.</p>
<p>For some reason, I told her I’d majored in history.</p>
<p>“Didn’t that get kind of—well, old?”</p>
<p>“No,” I said.  “Not really.”</p>
<p>“Baron, you need the Peregrine experience,” she said.  “No excuses!”</p>
<p>Everyone was quoting Amy Knobloch.  “Can I speak with your supervisor?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” Sandy said.  “But it won’t make any difference.”</p>
<p>And it didn’t.  It was company policy.  He said Peregrine couldn’t possibly fill my cabin five days before a Cruise to Nowhere.  “Even if we—even if <em>you</em>— could find an emergency replacement, there’d be no time for Homeland Security prescreening.”  But he did assure me that I’d have special handling once I was on board.</p>
<p>Special handling.  So, by God, I was going Nowhere whether I liked it or not.  After I slammed down the phone—one of the great advantages of a land line—I saw Marjorie’s oldest, most crinkly Post-It next to our list of emergency numbers.</p>
<p>I WILL CELEBRATE EACH DAY<br />
AND MAKE IT COUNT</p>
<p>I found a fresh Post-It packet and peeled off a new one of my own.</p>
<p>I WILL EXECRATE EACH DAY<br />
AND MAKE THEM PAY</p>
<p>Special handling would have a new meaning in the near future.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>I drove down to Charleston in Marjorie’s old Prius.  What with the Toyota recalls<br />
and those oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico, she’d gotten a great deal by threatening to buy<br />
an ElectroVolt.  Even after a decade of being semi-dependent on fossil fuel, we were still<br />
coming out ahead.</p>
<p>When I pulled into the Peregrine parking garage, MARCUS opened my door and told me he’d take care of my carryon bag.  “We don’t believe in carryon.”  His polished smile against his dark skin was almost blinding, even in fluorescent light.  “We check everything.  I’ll personally see that it gets to your cabin, sir.  After I valet your vehicle.”</p>
<p>I took out my wallet to give him a tip.  My problem was with the company, not with the staff.</p>
<p>“We don’t believe in cash.”  He pointed to his Peregrine nametag.  “We all have a six-character ID.  When you get your BuyPass at boarding, stop at the gratuity kiosk and punch me in.”  His index finger was still underlining his nametag.  “Just remember—MARCUS rhymes with PARKUS.”</p>
<p>“I’ll remember,” I said.</p>
<p>“Let me take that vase,” he said.</p>
<p>“She’s not a vase,” I said, wrapping both my arms around what was left of Marjorie.  “And she comes with me.”</p>
<p>“Good luck,” he said.  “With Homeland Security.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>For my sake, Marjorie had chosen the NASCAR boarding option.  She would’ve preferred Hawaiian Vista or Himalayan View, but she knew I was a big fan.  “And<br />
besides,” she’d said, “our ship holds ten thousand people.  NASCAR gets to board first.”</p>
<p>It made sense to me.</p>
<p>Except for the maze of yellow crime tape to keep us all moving in the right direction, it was like standing in the infield at Darlington or Daytona.  Virtual Fords and Chevvies were racing on the skin of the inner walls, their advertising logos stretched to DayGlo blurs—although the sound was muted, so we could hear any emergency directives from Homeland Security.  It was real enough to make you throw up, and the guy in the Jeff Gordon cap in front of me did.  Fortunately, the Peregrine staff had issued recyclable barf bags at the door.  When I started to get dizzy, I held Marjorie in one hand while I studied my Yphone map of the Peregrine <em>Windhover</em>.</p>
<p>The crew lived on Deck Zero.  The umbilical would lead us directly to Sensorama, one of the main decks. The other one, Panorama, had duty-free shopping and outdoor access.  There were four residence decks.  Circe, for guys who like to party hearty.  Medea, for the families with kids.  I’d be on Tithonus, Deck Five—right below Narcissus, the top deck, with UV-resistant skylights and personal size pools for the young singles.  Then a pop-up ad interrupted my Map App.  <em>Peregrine—All who wander are not lost</em>.  I couldn’t get rid of the damn thing.  I had to turn off my phone.</p>
<p>When I finally arrived at the Homeland Security station, they stopped me before I could enter the full body scan.  “Hey,” I said.  “That’s my wife.”  I showed the agents Marjorie’s passport and the crematorium’s RFID on the underside of the urn, so they let us pass through, together.  But when I came up to the Peregrine counter on the far side, next to the umbilical gangplank, an orange-haired woman older than God wouldn’t let us on the ship.  “We’ll take your hand baggage to your cabin, sir.  As soon as you get your BuyPass.”  I told GRACIE that my wife was a paying passenger—and I showed her the virtual receipt on my Yphone to prove it.  “I want the two BuyPasses she’s bought and paid for,” I said. “One for me, and one for her.”</p>
<p>“That’s not a person,” GRACIE sputtered.</p>
<p>Her supervisor had to commandeer her computer terminal.  Then I walked to the<br />
gratuity kiosk and tipped MARCUS five bucks—on my BuyPass.  GRACIE got a<br />
virtual nickel—on Marjorie’s.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>My carryon was waiting for me at my cabin, with a special consideration bracelet that entitled me to unlimited free drinks—and to senior singles dining, rather than Tithonus for Two.  After I unpacked, I tucked Marjorie into the closet across from the bathroom door.  She always seemed to like closets, especially when she felt hopelessly, helplessly mad at something.  Room service brought me a bottle of champagne, which I promptly popped and poured down the toilet.  After I flushed forty-five times, I ran both the sink and the shower full force in the tiny bathroom.  Sitting on the edge of the king size bed, I could imagine I was living next to a pair of malfunctioning deepwater drilling rigs—the Peregrine spills, draining the Peregrine corporate coffers!  Compensation!  Then I settled down for a nap before dinner.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>On the Tithonus Deck, you really couldn’t tell if the ship was moving.  The virtual window in my cabin had no curtains, just a remote control.  I had always assumed that the Cruise to Nowhere went <em>somewhere</em>, if only in circles, but maybe the <em>Windhover</em> could wallow in port and save fuel.  At some point, I’d have to go to the Panorama Deck and step outside, to see if we’d actually left the harbor.</p>
<p>I was a late arrival at senior singles.  They’d put me at a round table for eight, with plenty of room for wide bodies and wheelchair access.  JIMSKI had already taken orders for appetizers, and he handed me an ivory menu right away, so I could catch up.  I told him I wanted two.</p>
<p>“Which?”  He pronounced it to rhyme with <em>beach</em>.</p>
<p>“Two <em>menus</em>,” I said.  “One for me, and one for my wife.”  I placed Marjorie’s urn to the left of my water glass.  “A chair for the lady, please.”</p>
<p>JIMSKI knitted his black, woolly eyebrows and led me to the maitre d’s station, where I flashed Marjorie’s BuyPass.  After consulting his virtual manifest, the maitre d’ dragged a chair from a vacant table and begged my pardon.  JIMSKI settled Marjorie into her seat and propped a menu between her urn and the lacy hem of the tablecloth.</p>
<p>By this time, all the appetizers had arrived, but no one was left to eat them—except for one woman, on the far side of the table.  She looked like Jackie Kennedy before she got cancer.  Only with curly hair.  With her left cheek angled in my direction, she was giving me a smirk that could’ve been Photoshopped from the Mona Lisa.</p>
<p>I looked down at my menu and said, “My wife and I will be having the lobster bisque.” JIMSKI leaned in towards my ear, then pointed to the urn.  “Does she tip?”  He pronounced it to rhyme with <em>sheep</em>.</p>
<p>“Of course,” I said.  “What happened to the other senior singles?”</p>
<p>“They leave for open dining.  Not to be coming back.  They say you are one French fry short of Happy Meal.”</p>
<p>Jackie Kennedy was still halfway smiling, but she hadn’t said a word.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>At 7:30 A.M. I called room service for a full American breakfast.   Everything but my bagel and black coffee got flushed.  After I turned off the sink and the shower, which I’d kept running all night—I didn’t want my towel steward getting suspicious—I took the elevator down to Sensorama.  The videos hadn’t started yet.  Our cruise director, RYAN01, stood center stage, spotlighted, in the middle of his introductory spiel.</p>
<p>“How many of you blokes are from Indiana?  California?  The Rockies?  New York?  New England?  The Land of Dixie?”  For the first time, there was more than a smattering of applause.  “Can you squeal like a pig for me?”</p>
<p>Somebody obliged.</p>
<p>“All right!”  RYAN01 rubbed his hand over his blond crew cut.  “When I worked in Australia, I’d always ask about other countries, but this is the Cruise <em>to</em> Nowhere!  Not the Cruise <em>from</em> Nowhere!”</p>
<p>Now everybody was cheering.</p>
<p>“How many of you are ready for your Hermetic Vacation?  How many of you All Americans are <em>pumped</em>?”</p>
<p>“USA!  USA!  USA!  USA!”</p>
<p>It was enough to make me nostalgic for Barack Obama.</p>
<p>“The first stop on your Hermetic Vacation will be . . . Jamaica!   And remember, blokes, I’m RYAN01!  And I accept gratuities!”</p>
<p>When the lights dimmed, we were docking in Ocho Rios.  The deep blue harbor shimmered in the dawn sun, without an oil slick in sight.  Green hills beckoned in the distance.</p>
<p>On the cab ride to Prospect Plantation, a legless beggar waved at us from the curb.  When he opened his mouth to speak, half of his front teeth were missing.</p>
<p>“Where are his six characters?”  the woman in front of me whispered.  “I can’t see his six characters!”</p>
<p>At the plantation, we took a jitney ride through sugar cane, pineapples, and banana trees.  When the dirt road began to get rougher, my seat began to shake.</p>
<p>“That is what we call the Jamaican massage!”  said RUPERT, our digital tour guide.  He wore loose tribal pants and no shirt.  After he hopped down from the front of the jitney, we watched him climb a coconut tree.  It slanted about thirty degrees from the perpendicular, so he could walk up with his bare feet while he wrapped his hands around the other side of the trunk and leaned back, straight as a telephone pole, extending his black arms.</p>
<p>I remember hoping he had good insurance. At the top, when he took both hands off the tree to pick a coconut, RUPERT plummeted into a cartoony, multicolored cushion made from his six Peregrine characters. Everybody laughed, including RUPERT.  “Me bad, man!”</p>
<p>He pronounced it <em>bod</em>.</p>
<p>The ride back to the harbor featured a terrorist ambush and three IEDs.  At that point, I gave up on Sensorama.  Two college kids from the Circe Deck were slouching next to the open door, swilling beer, even though it wasn’t even 10 A.M. yet.  Their Peregrine specialty T-shirts read DRINK, PISS, REPEAT.</p>
<p>I heard an enormous explosion behind me.</p>
<p>“Hey, this is awesome, man.”  Their brown bottles clinked together.  “It’s like being in the middle of a suicide bombing!”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Jackie Kennedy’s name was Gabriella.  On the second night of the cruise, we were sitting alone at our table, if you didn’t count Marjorie.  When I tried to start a conversation, she shook her head sadly.  “No English.  Italiano.”</p>
<p>I have to admit I felt relieved.  “No Italiano.  English.”</p>
<p>Then she pointed to Marjorie’s ashes, and then to me, and finally to her own heart. “Yes,” I said, nodding vertically, in what I hoped was a universal gesture.  “I do love my wife.”</p>
<p>Now she pointed to the FrankenShrimp on her plate, licked her glossy lips, and circled her other hand in front of the bodice of her black dress.</p>
<p>I tried not to stare at her stunning cleavage.  “Yes, the food here is very good.”  I rubbed my own tummy.  “Yum.”</p>
<p>While we were waiting for the crème brulée, she took a Yphone out of her tiny purse.  To give her some privacy—how could she know I <em>really</em> didn’t speak Italian?—I stood up to go to the rest room.  A moment later, my own phone began to trill.</p>
<p>“Yes?”  I said.</p>
<p>Now I heard a digitized female voice.  “I speak Italian.  You speak English.  Are you understanding this?”</p>
<p>I turned back to my senior singles table and saw her Mona Lisa.  She must have the Yphone Plus, with the proximity function and the Instant Translation App.  “Okie-dokie,” I said.</p>
<p>She blinked her big eyelashes.  “Please try again.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said.  I wondered how I sounded in her own language.  “I am understanding this.”</p>
<p>“Good.  My name is Gabriella.  What is your name?”</p>
<p>Now I spoke directly across the table, not into the Yphone.  I didn’t think I should trust her software on this one.</p>
<p>“Breed Love.”  Her slight smile widened for the first time.</p>
<p>“My last name.”  I was speaking into my phone again.  “What is your last name?”</p>
<p>“I am a woman,” I heard.  “It changes.”</p>
<p>Our desserts arrived.  The caramelized crust was so good that I ate Marjorie’s<br />
portion as well as my own.  When I finished, I said, “Where is the rest of our table?” Gabriella tilted her head and lifted the linen next to her water glass, baring the faux rosewood beneath.  Then she shrugged, extending both open palms toward the ceiling.</p>
<p>I decided to try again.  “Where did the other people at our table go?”</p>
<p>She half-stifled a snicker, which I wish she hadn’t done, because I’d like to have heard what a Yphone Plus would do with a snicker.  “I hope they will go buying some shoes.”</p>
<p>Except for Gabriella, every senior single I’d seen so far waddled around in flip-flops or sneakers.  “Walruses don’t wear shoes,” I said.</p>
<p>This time, Gabriella covered her mouth with both hands.  Then she said something that came through my earpiece as “That is not nice.  But that is true.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>After dinner, I returned to my cabin to practice for Senior Karaoke.  The <em>Morning Memo to Our Most Seasoned Cruisers</em> had included a list of the featured songs—“just in case the words changed since the last time you heard them!!!”  I decided to pass on <em>Margaritaville</em>, <em>Love Me Tender</em>, <em>When I’m 64</em>, and <em>My Heart Will Go On</em>.  I’d be performing <em>Mister Lonely</em>.</p>
<p>I wrote out my customized lyrics on the backside of the <em>Morning Memo</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Truly<br />
Peregrine screwed me<br />
They kept her deposit<br />
When my wife died<br />
She paid for our passage<br />
She prepaid our passage<br />
When I asked for a refund<br />
I was promptly denied<br />
So now I’m nowhere<br />
On The Cruise to Nowhere<br />
Away from home<br />
Through no wish of my own<br />
That’s why I’m lonely<br />
I’m Mister Lonely<br />
This fucking cruise line has no soul</p></blockquote>
<p>Because there were no <em>A</em>’s with guts enough to go up to the front of the Tithonus Lounge, Mister Baron Breedlove was performing first.  A hundred geezers sat in the audience, half of them in wheelchairs.  There was one kid, in her twenties maybe, with the biggest incisors I’d ever seen.  I figured she was somebody’s granddaughter.</p>
<p>The DJ handed me a cordless mic and asked me if I wanted to increase the font size of Bobby Vinton’s lyrics on the teleprompter.</p>
<p>“No thanks,” I said.</p>
<p>He told me to suit myself, and he started the music.  Not that there’s very much music in those early 60s tearjerkers—just a few humming violins and a snare drum that could put you to sleep.  When I finished, he said, “Sir, you might want the bigger letters next time.”</p>
<p>I was still receiving polite applause from everybody who could move both hands.  “Don’t believe everything you read,” I said, returning the mic.  “Especially if it’s on a screen.”  He handed me a souvenir CD so I could relive my celebrity experience forever.  “If you’d like a digitally enhanced video in a Peregrine carrying case,” he said, “you can put it on your BuyPass.  Of course, it’ll mean some extra work for me.”  Then he whispered, “It’s something we Afrikaners are used to.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, BIGMIX,” I said.  “You’re a man of characters.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>I spent most of the next day on the Promenade Deck.  It would’ve been the perfect vacation for Marjorie—almost as big as Mall Mart, but with exotic specialty stores and no groceries to worry about.  I tried to find the jewelry boutique on my own, since I hate to ask for directions, but I finally had to go to a kiosk for a shopping consultant.  “I’m looking for a forty-fifth anniversary present,” I said.</p>
<p>“We keep the good stuff in back.”  She offered her bony elbow and waited for me to take it. “For a more personalized experience.”  Then she escorted me to a door marked AUTHORIZED SHOPPERS ONLY.</p>
<p>TIFF01 had that elegant, half-starved look that other women seem to envy.  I told her she was the first Peregrine crew member I’d met from my own country.  “Yes,” she said.  “They save most of us for the upscale shopping.  It helps Americans to relate.  I mean, you buy <em>postcards</em> from Panamanians.  Not Porsches.”</p>
<p>She was leading me past illuminated display cases of designer watches, wedding rings, engagement rings, earrings, toe rings, nose rings, navel rings, charm bracelets, pendants, and pins.  “I don’t see any Porsches,” I said.</p>
<p>“I have the authority to sell anything.  If you don’t see it here, I can get it for you in three days.  Duty free.  Anything.  Including the ship.”</p>
<p>I told her I wanted a nice necklace for my wife.  Nothing but the best.  That she deserved a nice surprise, for a change.</p>
<p>“The Heart of the Ocean.”  Her deep, hollow eyes took on a strange glow. “Would you prefer the standard cubic zirconia or an exact replica of the blue diamond?”</p>
<p>“What’s the difference?”</p>
<p>“About 25K.”</p>
<p>I asked her to show me both.  I couldn’t tell them apart.</p>
<p>“She will.  Take my word for it.”  TIFF01 draped the exact replica lovingly around her long neck and kissed the blue stone.  Her scarlet lipstick didn’t leave a smudge.  “Anybody gives me one of <em>these</em>, he gets the key to <em>my</em> cabin.  Even if he’s from Circe.  And believe me, those guys are animals.”</p>
<p>“Is it insured?”</p>
<p>“For the cruise.  After that, you’re on your own.”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t anybody say they just lost it?  And hide it in their luggage before we get back to Charleston?”</p>
<p>TIFF01 laughed.  “They can try.  But there’s an indelible electronic tag on all of our merchandise.  You couldn’t get it through the scanners even if you ate it.”</p>
<p>While she was verifying the credit limit on my BuyPass she said, “Better get ready for a long night, Leo.”</p>
<p>I told her my name was Baron.</p>
<p>“Not tonight it isn’t.”  She told me the usual gratuity on high end jewelry was five percent— six, for exceptional service.</p>
<p>“Well, I think you’re exceptional,” I said.</p>
<p>“You are such a dear man.  Just make sure you enter Tiff Zero One at the kiosk.”  She placed the necklace into a velvet Peregrine case, and she lowered her voice to a hard whisper.  “Tiff Zero Two is a real bra breaker.  Even worse than my sister.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>After another Yphone dinner with Gabriella, I decided to take Marjorie down to the Promenade Deck.  She would have wanted us to go outside at least <em>once</em>.</p>
<p>The airlock loomed at the stern of the ship.  NON-CLIMATE CONTROLLED AREA.  UNSECURED PETROCHEMICAL VAPORS.  The door was that gunmetal gray I’d seen on submarines in the movies.  You had to insert your BuyPass over the handle and sign an electronic waiver before it’d budge.  When it did, I was hit by a blast of hot, humid air that smelled like an old garage.</p>
<p>The balcony was narrow, but it ran the whole width of the ship.  The <em>Windhover</em> had indeed left Charleston harbor.  While I stood at the railing and swiveled my head, horizon to horizon, I could see only open ocean.  When I looked straight down, the ship’s wake was churning up white in the moonlight, with little rainbow flecks on the outer edges.  I wondered if it was all water, but I inhaled deeply anyway.  Marjorie would have wanted me to inhale.</p>
<p>Marjorie had been adventurous.  Not like me.  After all those miscarriages, she would’ve been willing to try again—even though the doctors had told us she’d be taking a big chance.  One summer, while she was off with her mother on a bed-and-breakfast tour of the Blue Ridge Mountains, I had a vasectomy.  I never told her about it.</p>
<p>“You were right, Marjorie,” I said aloud.  “About the Hermetic Vacation.”</p>
<p>But I knew if she’d been planning a vacation just for herself, she’d have done things differently.  Marjorie always liked to take things into her own hands.  If she hadn’t spoken to me first, at college, we’d never even have met.  Years later, after she’d finally given up on the idea of having a family, I wondered whether she’d started hard-core couponing because she felt cheated—by everyone and everything around her.  Because she was tired of paying and paying, because she wanted the world to give her something back, because she was trying to get even.  And, by God, because she was damn good at it.</p>
<p>I took the necklace out of my pocket and dropped it into the urn.  “Happy anniversary, honey.”</p>
<p>I heard a gasping sob.  When I spun around to face the airlock, the door was still latching.<br />
I took Marjorie back inside and used my BuyPass to check the log of electronic signatures.  There wasn’t much to read.  The only other name was Winifred Poogan.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>On the last evening of my Cruise to Nowhere, Gabriella brought Captain Caravaggio Cupisti to our dinner table.  He was a tall man, neither young nor old, with the kind of slicked-back hair you only saw in the movies.  Except for his missing cap, he was in full uniform, with gold braiding on his broad, padded shoulders.</p>
<p>After she whispered some Italian into his ear, he said, “I am coming here, Baron Breedlove, to renew your wedding vows, and this lovely lady will assist me.”  JIMSKI picked up Marjorie’s urn from its customary place at the table, and he handed it to Gabriella.  While the wheelchairs and walkers gathered around us, Gabriella stood next to me, but she didn’t say a word.  Up close she looked older than Marjorie, older than me, with an ancient scar on her cheek.  But she was wearing white, and she had remarkable posture.  And, at precisely the right moment, she gave me my bride, and she began the applause.  Captain Caravaggio Cupisti shook my hand and said “<em>Signore</em>” before leaving.  Since none of his names had six characters, I figured he didn’t expect to be tipped.</p>
<p>After the cherries jubilee, when Gabriella rose from the table, she pressed a tiny red pouch, with a silver drawstring, into my left hand.  “You will need this, Baron Breed Love.  But you will not see me again.”</p>
<p>I was so shocked to hear her speak English that I didn’t even ask her why not.  When I loosened the drawstring of the pouch, I saw a pair of sterling silver earrings in the shape of tiny high-heeled shoes.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>We docked in Charleston the next morning, but there was a final breakfast— with open seating, in the Tithonus dining room—for anyone who didn’t have early travel connections.  Marjorie wasn’t with me, and she wasn’t with my luggage, either, which I’d already entrusted to MARCUS.  I’d decided to leave her—and her new necklace—in my cabin, facing the virtual window, with the Peregrine sticker from the jewelry box over the label from the crematorium.  Marjorie had always wanted to travel.  With any luck, the stewards would figure she was part of the room.  I read somewhere that Peregrine made every cabin unique.  And if anyone tried to take her from the <em>Windhover</em>, an electronic alarm would go off, and I’d be duly notified.</p>
<p>I hadn’t yet decided whether I’d report the necklace as missing.  25K is a lot of money, but I had to admit I was feeling better than five days ago.  SINGLE HANDED.  NO EXCUSES.  Maybe Amy Knobloch was right.</p>
<p>JIMSKI brought out a simple Continental breakfast—one for me, and one for Marjorie.   After spelling out his six-character ID—twice—he told me he was going on shore leave just as soon as he got out of his uniform.</p>
<p>He wished me and my wife a good trip home. While I was sipping my coffee, a young woman asked if she could join me.  She had the kind of face that would’ve looked adorable on a five-year-old but seemed faintly ridiculous on an adult.</p>
<p>“I think they’ve stopped serving,” I said.</p>
<p>“Just to sit,” she said.  “If you don’t mind.”</p>
<p>I pointed to Marjorie’s untouched breakfast.  “It’s a shame to have this go to waste, honey.”</p>
<p>While we were eating, she told me she’d been staying on the Narcissus Deck.</p>
<p>“I never went up there,” I said.</p>
<p>She grimaced.  “You wouldn’t like it.  Nobody cares about anybody.  All they did was, like, stare into the pool.  They hardly ever talked to each other.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” I said.  “But at least you got a good tan.”</p>
<p>“It’s fake.  Peregrine just doctors the Jacuzzis.”  She grimaced again, like a toddler with indigestion.  “Let’s face it.  I look like a chipmunk who’s been dropped in a vat of milk chocolate.  And just look at my teeth.”</p>
<p>I’d seen those teeth before—at Senior Karaoke.</p>
<p>“Everybody on Narcissus was getting theirs bleached.”  She drew back her lower lip, so her incisors seemed even longer than they really were.  “The Color Me Beautiful package.”</p>
<p>“They are very—white,” I said.</p>
<p>Now she started crying, with the racking, shoulder-wrenching sobs of a child.  “Please stop that,” I said.  “Please.  Stop.”  But she couldn’t.  I started thinking about that self-made waterfall in my own cabin, five days’ worth of sopping towels, the urn I’d left behind.  Marjorie would have wanted me to do something.  To give her something.  I couldn’t leave her like this.  But she didn’t have six characters, and she couldn’t stop crying.  So I finally reached into my pocket, and I took out Gabriella’s tiny shoes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"> The clanking of the car’s engine ceases a few miles outside of town and Cliff and I settle into it, the wide quiet. We’re told that here, high up and in fall, aspens turn whole mountains gold.<span>  </span>I twist the knob on the radio, though it’s been broken for years.<span>  </span>We listen, instead, to rubber on asphalt.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">For a while I watch the scrub, scouring the beige sand for coyotes or jackrabbits.<span>  </span>Then, looking down I notice the specks of coffee and dust in the vinyl lining of the emergency brake.<span>  </span>My husband, Cliff, stares at the road, the yellow lines finally disappearing.<span>  </span>He’s from the desert and so he likes this, this alien blue sky, the way the road out in the distance wiggles and turns into a lake.<span>  </span>I’m from the coast.<span>  </span>I miss the trees, the way they hide wires and facades, the way they block up the view.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Because it’s quiet, because we are the only people we know here, Cliff and I argue.<span>  </span>It’s nothing serious.<span>  </span>He leaves his clothes in the washer until they’re dried to the sides and must be peeled away.<span>  </span>If I ask him to take out the trash, he asks me to pick up my clothes. This morning we argued about eggs, whether when you poach one, you put vinegar in the water.<span>  </span>Oh, the quiet—the big brown mesa out our window blowing air and dust and birds, the way it turns us toward each other like opposing magnets.<span>  </span>He’s still sore at me for asking him if he ever poached an egg.<span>  </span>“It’s not what you <em>ask</em>,” he said, leaning forward with his shoulders.<span>  </span>“It’s how you ask it.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Today, we’ll find the aspens.<span>  </span>But, Cliff seems to say with his jaw, with his arms locked in front of him like two table legs, this doesn’t mean he forgives me.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Let’s play a game,” I offer.<span>  </span>Cliff pushes back into his seat, listening. I remove my feet from the glovebox, leaving a dusty grid.<span>  </span>“Tell me a story.<span>  </span>Something I don’t know about you.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">He uses his thumb to flatten the hair above his sideburns.<span>  </span>Last night, during a peaceful interlude, I trimmed them.<span>  </span>Now they look shorn while the top of his hair puffs up, a shiny mushroom.<span>  </span>He’s clearly wrestling with it—whether to succumb to the invitation, filling the car with friendly chatter or refuse, keeping the petulant, if ridiculous, chill.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Cliff watches the road for a while.<span>  </span>He keeps mints in the cup holder and now he reaches for one.<span>  </span>It crunches between his teeth.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">We drive over a dead gopher and Cliff shakes his head slowly.<span>  </span>He’s a failed vegetarian, but the sight of road kill makes him pensive.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“What kind of story?” he asks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“I don’t know.<span>  </span>Something you’ve never told me.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Give me a topic,” he says.<span>  </span>I touch his hand on the steering wheel and briefly, he takes his other hand and puts it on top of mine.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Injuries or scars,” I say, because why not?<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“You already know about my scars,” he says, which is true.<span>  </span>He had a large mole removed from his thigh when he was young and it left a raw pink line which he sometimes claims is a shark bite.<span>  </span>He has a small white storm of marks on his ankle from getting caught in some barbed wire.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“The next time we see a gas station, we have to stop,” he says.<span>  </span>“Did I ever tell you about Shane and the BB gun?” I watch the little black arrow on the gas gauge hover over the white square.<span>  </span>The gas light flicks on.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“No,” I say.<span>  </span>“God, do you remember when everyone had a BB gun?<span>  </span>A kid in my first grade class had a BB embedded in his neck.<span>  </span>You could feel it if you put your fingers on the right place.”<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Cliff glances at the gas light.<span>  </span>He takes another mint.<span>  </span>When he chews, the hollows of his cheeks suck in, making deep caverns.<span>  </span>He hasn’t shaved.<span>  </span>Little flecks of copper and gold wink from the indentations.<span>  </span>“It was that kid, Todd, the one I told you about, the one whose mother brought in super-eight footage of his birth,” I say.<span>  </span>I’m thirty-four and still, whenever someone tells me they’re pregnant, I conjure Todd’s mom hanging from stirrups, screaming like her skin was on fire.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Cliff and I talk about having children—two maybe, even three, but we’ve never actually tried.<span>  </span>Sometimes at night, I pat at the space between us and say, here she is, our Josephina, our Noah, our little progeny.<span>  </span>For a few years, Cliff played along, contributing geographical baby names: Topanga, Tonopah, Sierra.<span>  </span>But now it’s become routine, an airy joke.<span>  </span>Often, he just ignores me.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>He sees a sign and circles back to the last Allsup’s before the mountains.<span>  </span>Leaving the nozzle in the car, he walks into the mini-mart.<span>  </span>The passenger seat won’t move back, no matter how much I try to force it, and when I reach under to wiggle the crank, I find an empty wine bottle there, escaped from the recycling.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">My mind flits to a story I heard in school years ago.<span>  </span>Apollo, god of light and music, is struck by the beauty of a sibyl. What will she trade him for one night in bed?<span>  </span>She considers it.<span>  </span>This is a sharp sibyl and she sees her chance.<span>  </span>He’s a god.<span>  </span>What else to wish for but eternal life?<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Time passes, though, and the sibyl has a change of heart.<span>  </span>She doesn’t want to sleep with him, doesn’t want to hold up her end of the bargain.<span>  </span>It doesn’t take Apollo long to tilt the scales back in his favor.<span>  </span>He’s given her eternal life, but not yet eternal youth.<span>  </span>So, the sibyl ages—and ages forever—growing smaller and smaller as she does.<span>  </span>When she’s finally as small as a grain of sand, she’s swept into a bottle at the ocean’s edge, trapped in a prison of glass.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>It’s moments like these, with a story in my head, that the absence of little Josephina is most pronounced.<span>  </span>She appears, but in ghost form.<span>  </span>I can almost feel her.<span>  </span>Her fine hair is a version of my own, coppery with a corkscrew curl.<span>  </span>She listens to the myth or the song on the radio and I feel a sweep of understanding.<span>  </span>I will leave the world someday, but she will carry our history in these details.<span>  </span>The time I told her the myth while waiting for Cliff to fill the tank.<span>  </span>The way the sun warmed the plastic dash, the fungusy smell of the car.<span>  </span>These things will crawl inside of her like seeds, becoming both important and frivolous, the way history does.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>I would tell Josephina that a sibyl knows everything.<span>  </span>She can see war coming to her country, she can see her friends in peril.<span>   </span>If she were free, she’d have the power to change this, but she’s not free.<span>  </span>She’ll see her predictions come true through the fog of sea-salted glass, growing even tinier, even more insignificant.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><em>I want to die!</em> she’ll cry in her tiny voice.<span>  </span><em>I want to die!</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Cliff tosses a bag of chips at me.<span>   </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“They only had that kind,” he says.<span>  </span>“Super Nacho Cheese with Jalapeño.”<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">A cartoon animal on the front of the package looks like he’d like to lunge at my throat.<span>  </span>I stick the chips by my feet.<span>  </span>Cliff finishes up the gas.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I pick the bottle up and check it for sibyls.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“That’s my emergency plan,” he says, climbing back in.<span>  </span>“Since I refuse to get a cell phone.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">It takes me a minute to understand.<span>  </span>“And float it in what ocean?” I ask.<span>  </span>He shrugs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“God will provide,” he says.<span>  </span>“Open the chips.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The bag’s swollen from the elevation and makes a whooshing sound when I tug.<span>   </span>The quiet happens again.<span>  </span>Two cars pass, making wind.<span>  </span>A large black bird hangs in the sky.<span>  </span>We’re headed up now, then down into a small canyon where some adobes are sprinkled at random, then up again, climbing the side of a mountain.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“It was in Reno,” Cliff says.<span>  </span>“When we lived in Reno, me, my mom, and that guy Ray.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I’ve heard about Ray.<span>  </span>I imagine he was wound too tight, his jaw just skin over a series of pulleys and wires.<span>  </span>Oiled black hair and an oiled black jacket and oiled black shoes.<span>  </span>A belt buckle that sagged toward the floor.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Well, Ray was married when he was seeing my mom.<span>  </span>I told you that, right?<span>  </span>He had this wife.<span>  </span>I can’t remember her name—Pricilla, Prissy—she came around every once in a while.”<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>I put a woman with oily Ray.<span>  </span>One of those women who lack moisture, whose face stretches taught against bone.<span>  </span>She wears a dress—no a waitress uniform.<span>  </span>Light blue with an apron.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Cliff reaches for more chips.<span>  </span>One has fallen onto his tee shirt, defying gravity.<span>  </span>It sits there, cockeyed, at an improbable angle, like a small invisible hand props it up.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“She got a boob job.<span>  </span>That I remember.”<span>  </span>He shakes his head.<span>  </span>“Is that even possible?<span>  </span>Were people getting boob jobs in the late seventies?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“I’d guess yes.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Well, one day she came to the house to pick up her son, Shane.<span>  </span>I guess Ray had joint custody or something.<span>  </span>Shane stashed all these low-budget porno magazines in our shed, so we used to go out there.”<span>  </span>Cliff widens his eyes and makes a smooth, angel face. “Of course, I never looked at the magazines,” he says.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Right.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Prissy was just some older lady, but that day she arrived with a rack like you’ve never seen.<span>  </span>Made a big impression on me.<span>  </span>I was ten.”<span>  </span>He takes another handful of chips.<span>   </span>The rack doesn’t fit with my light blue uniform.<span>  </span>I try to reinvent her—polyester tee shirts?<span>  </span>Low cut blouses?<span>  </span>But now my images are muddled.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Shane had this BB gun.<span>  </span>These chips are gross.<span>  </span>The jalapeño tastes like motor oil.”<span>   </span>Cliff tosses his handful back in the bag, then wipes his hand on his shorts, leaving a small orange dusting.<span>  </span>“I have no idea if Ray got it for him, or if he borrowed it, or if it was from one of his mother’s boyfriends.<span>  </span>Because I remember a lot of boyfriends involved in this Ray thing.<span>  </span>There was Ray, my mom’s boyfriend, but then there were these huge guys with wolves for pets that tagged along with Shane’s mother.<span>  </span>And Ray would get really drunk and cry on the back porch and sometimes my mom would kick him out.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Cliff’s hands clench and unclench around the wheel, his mind skimming over its own history.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Shane had the gun,” he says again.<span>  </span>“And so, obviously, we had to go shoot some stuff.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Obviously.”<span>  </span>I pick the chip off Cliff’s shirt.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Neither of us could drive yet.<span>  </span>Shane put the BB gun in a duffle bag and we got on a bus out of town, this bus that went to the edge of a housing development.<span>  </span>You could walk straight into nowhere after the last house ended.” <span>          </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“You were ten?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“I know.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>For a woman who soothed dying people for a living, who saw that life was temporary, Cliff’s mother, Connie, was surprisingly oblivious to danger.<span>  </span>She dated men with gun racks, knife collections and special radios.<span>  </span>Once, she rode on the back of a motorcycle wearing nothing but a negligee.<span>  </span>I met her two years before she died, after her exotic beauty had given way to a muted and fleshy facade.<span>  </span>She had the coloring of a Christmas dinner—ham and bread pudding, overboiled green beans.<span>  </span>But photos of her young capture sharp shoulders and lithe arms, a butt poured into dark denim.<span>  </span>In a few she winks, as if she knows a secret.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Shane wanted to shoot lizards.<span>  </span>So we did.<span>  </span>We shot maybe six of them.<span>  </span>They were sunning on the rocks and we just picked them off.<span>  </span>I don’t think we missed even one.”<span>  </span>It’s odd he doesn’t cringe, this man who softens over the sight of a gopher smeared like jam over the asphalt.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“And then, the weird part,” Cliff said.<span>  </span>“Shane wanted me to take the gun.<span>  </span>He put it in my hands and he dared me to shoot my own foot.<span>  </span>I said no. He said it would feel good.<span>  </span>I asked him if he’d done it, shot his own foot.<span>  </span>And Shane pulled up his pant leg and showed me a whole mess of scars, a million tiny white bumps and lines.”<span>  </span>He reaches for the chips, but changes his mind.<span>  </span>“Do you have any gum?” he asks.<span>  </span>I don’t.<span>  </span>“Water?” he asks.<span>  </span>I hand him my Nalgene.<span>  </span>He drinks for what seems like a long time.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“And then?” I say.<span>  </span>Cliff takes another swig of water and wedges the bottle between his thighs.<span>  </span>He taps his thumbs on the wheel and curls his lips around his teeth.<span>  </span>He sits there lipless, remembering.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Shane got really intense.<span>  </span>He took my hand and tried to force me to shoot myself.<span>  </span>I didn’t want to do it, but I was only ten and I wasn’t as strong as him.<span>  </span>Finally he managed to get me pinned beneath him, but he couldn’t hold me down and make me shoot at the same time.<span>  </span>The gun was actually a little ways off in the dirt. Shane said he’d only let me go if I shot him.<span>  </span>I haven’t ever told anyone this,” he says.<span>  </span>“It’s not really a story.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span> </span>“Well, I want to know what happens.<span>  </span>Did you shoot him in the leg?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Yes,” Cliff says. He curls his lips around his teeth again.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“You shot him in the leg.”<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I defrost Cliff from old photos I’ve seen of his childhood.<span>  </span>He’s in a yellow soccer jersey and he’s grinning, smashing his eyes to slits, a front tooth cockeyed, his cowlicks untamed.<span>  </span>I try adding a gun to the visual, but as soon as I do, the whole thing collapses.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I shot him in the leg. He picked up the gun and handed it to me then he turned around.<span>  </span>I got him in the back of the calf.”<span>  </span>Cliff hunches his shoulders.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I’m about to ask what it felt like, that moment the metal hit skin. But before I can ask, Cliff jerks the wheel to the right to take a turn.<span>  </span>“Is this what we’re looking for?” he asks.<span>  </span>Indeed, a green sign points the way.<span>  </span>The car flies over a series of potholes, causing us both to jolt forward.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Slow down,” I say.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“No kidding,” he says.<span>  </span>“Anyway.<span>  </span>Shane wanted me to touch his bleeding calf.<span>  </span>He grabbed my hand.<span>  </span>He just kept staring at me, like in a creepy way, romantic, sort of, like he was going to lean in.<span>  </span>And he was holding my hand.<span>  </span>So finally, I took a rock and punched him with it.”<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I can tell this is the part of the story, more than the gun, more than the creepy staring, that Cliff doesn’t like telling.<span>  </span>One side of his face looks cramped.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Shane didn’t do anything.<span>  </span>He just let go and covered his eye.<span>  </span>I walked back to the bus stop.<span>  </span>I had no money so I had to beg my way on.”<span>  </span>Cliff takes another mint.<span>  </span>The hollows happen. An ancient van looms in front of us and Cliff slows the car.<span>  </span>Someone has written <em>bite me you cougar</em> in the dirt on the back window.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“My mom broke up with Ray.<span>  </span>She said he drank too much.<span>  </span>And that was the end of Shane.<span>  </span>We never saw each other again.”<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">“I wonder what he’s doing now,” I say.<span>  </span>Cliff shrugs.<span>  </span>“Do you think he remembers it?” “Sure,” Cliff says.<span>  </span>“Wouldn’t you?”<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">And it’s true that these are the things you hold onto and don’t tell.<span>  </span>Because they’re weird, the wishes people make, the things we make come true.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“How come you’ve never told me that?” I ask.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“It’s not the kind of thing you tell,” he says.<span>  </span>I know what he means.<span>  </span>I take my thumb and run it over the prickly hair on his neck.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“It’s not such a bad story,” I say.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“You got worse?” he says.<span>  </span>I run my thumb over his neck again.<span>  </span>“Bite me you cougar,” Cliff says.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Do you know the story about the sibyl in the bottle?” I ask.<span>  </span>Cliff squints.<span>  </span>He shakes his head.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>I tell him about her, about how Apollo wants her then traps her.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">We sit quietly feeling each turn of the car.<span>  </span>The fall has frozen the air.<span>  </span>It has that particular quality of cool; it mutes the trees.<span>  </span>Even the bark looks grayer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“That’s a sad story,” Cliff says.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“There are a lot of sad stories,” I say.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Why didn’t she just sleep with him?” Cliff asks.<span>  </span>“He’s the sexiest god, right?”<span>  </span>I roll the bottle back and forth with my toe.<span>  </span>“What’s one thing I don’t know about you?” he asks.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>I’m not as good at things like this.<span>  </span>I can feel the feeling: that whirring sense of being unmoored by my own trespass.<span>  </span>But the only memory I have, the only one that fits this game, is one I don’t feel like telling.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“I used to step on ants outside and then try to heal them with Children’s Tylenol,” I say.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“That’s it?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“I once let a whole jar full of grasshoppers go in the living room.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Cliff shakes his head. <span> </span>“I’m never telling you anything again,” he says.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Okay, I know something.<span>  </span>I had a Spanish teacher in high school, Mr. Lombardi, who used to always threaten to give me a bad grade.<span>  </span>He said I was too quiet.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Hard to believe.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“My friend Kelsie said to go and talk to him.<span>  </span>She said if you went to talk with him, he’d be reasonable.<span>  </span>Kelsie was an awful student, but she always got As in Spanish.<span>  </span>Kelsie also had a big rack, to use your poetic phrasing.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Cliff smirks and brushes his eye with his hand.<span>  </span>One eyebrow sticks up, pointing to the dotted roof of the car.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“She was stacked,” I say.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“I get it,” Cliff says.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“But she was plain and none of the guys really liked her.<span>  </span>So anyways, I walked up to the door and the first thing I saw was Kelsie and Mr. Lombardi in the corner near the map of Mexico.<span>  </span>Then I saw that the map of Mexico was weirdly crinkled.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Uh oh.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Mr. Lombardi had both hands up her shirt.<span>  </span>Kelsie was sealed to the map, going up and down with his hands.<span>  </span>And she saw me.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“What a perv.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“I backed up and waited for her around the corner.<span>  </span>I said we should go to the principal.<span>  </span>That year we had a new principal, a woman.<span>  </span>I was excited to get Mr. Lombardi in trouble so I could avoid a C in Spanish.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“That’s why I love you.<span>  </span>Always thinking of others.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“But Kelsie said that if I told anyone, she would never speak to me again.<span>  </span>To this day, I’ve never seen anyone so certain, so—I don’t know—possessed.<span>  </span>She looked like this.”<span>  </span>I point to the lunging animal on the bag of chips.<span>  </span>“Years later, when we were both home for Winter Break, Kelsie told me that she lost her virginity to Mr. Lombardi on his daughter’s bed.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Gross,” Cliff says.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Yeah. She said she wished it would happen with him and it had.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“She wished to lose her virginity on the Spanish teacher’s daughter’s bed?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“I guess.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“So what’s the moral of your story?” Cliff asks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“What’s the moral of yours?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Cliff shrugs.<span>  </span>“Don’t take the bus,” he says.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“I never took another language class,” I say.<span>  </span>“Even in college.<span>  </span>I stayed away.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Is that the moral?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Does there have to be a moral?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I roll the window down.<span>  </span>Clouds are creeping in from the west. My sister, Kate, says that every year, people from the coasts go into the Rockies, the Sandias, the Jemez, and they don’t know about flash floods or lightning.<span>  </span>They bring cheese and specialty bars wrapped in foil, then wham, they’re dead.<span>  </span>She told me this when she came to hike in these very mountains.<span>  </span>It’s as though, by acknowledging this, she avoids that fate.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Does knowing help?<span>  </span>Sibyls are supposed to see into the future.<span>  </span>Couldn’t this one?<span>  </span>When she said no to Apollo, she didn’t see herself trapped in the bottle, wishing to die?<span>  </span>Or was that <em>why </em>she didn’t sleep with Apollo?<span>  </span>Did she know that the outside world, from the captivity within glass would glow brighter and brighter?<span>  </span>That because of the glass, the world inside of her would go vivid with longing and despair?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">In the distance, I see a yellow stand of aspens, but the car turns into some thick juniper and cottonwoods and they disappear.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Do you think he wanted to put something in or get something out?” I ask.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“What?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Do you think the point was to make a scar or to let something out, through the skin.<span>  </span>You know, like bloodletting.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Shane?”<span>  </span>Cliff moves his head slowly in a no.<span>  </span>“I couldn’t tell you.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>The wine bottle rolls under the seat and hits something metal.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span><span> </span>“If Apollo gave you one wish, what would you wish for?” I ask.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“To not have to sleep with Apollo,” Cliff says.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“I might wish for a baby.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Cliff looks at me sideways.<span>  </span>“It would come out half-god,” he says.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“It would come out, though.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Yes,” he says.<span>  </span>“I suppose so.<span>  </span>But maybe through the crown of your head.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“A baby for every grain of sand.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“A baby for every turning tree,” he says, “and you would be one busy woman.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>And then there they are, yellow as a room of canaries.<span>  </span>This is what they do at the end of their season—yelp this color into the desert sky, then send it scattering to the red ground.<span>  </span>Cliff parks the car under a stand of them.<span>  </span>I open the door.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Look at that,” Cliff says, pointing to a rainstorm of leaves, sent sailing with a wind.<span>  </span>His brow relaxes.<span>  </span>In typical desert fashion, the blue sky of the morning has transformed to dark clouds.<span>  </span>There will be storms tonight. The trees will go silver with winter.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Cliff’s mom told me about a client once, a fourteen-year-old girl dying of leukemia.<span>  </span>I was sitting on the sofa after brunch, stuffed to the gills, watching a cartoon and she just told me, out of the blue.<span>  </span>All this girl wanted was for a particular boy to come to her bedside.<span>  </span>She talked of nothing else.<span>  </span>But when the girl’s friends finally dragged the boy there, the girl wouldn’t look at him.<span>  </span>She was embarrassed by the state of her skin.<span>  </span>Then she died.<span>  </span>Connie finished this story, slapped her thighs, and got up to clean some counters.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Cliff arches his back.<span>  </span>“Let’s walk,” he says.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“It’s going to storm.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I know,” he says.<span>  </span>Far off over another set of hills, the first lightning flashes.<span>  </span>The wind moves slowly.<span>  </span>The world seems to shiver under its big hand.<span>  </span>Families in colorful jackets pack their cars, fleeing the mountains.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Cliff closes his door, but I wait, caught for a moment.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I try not to think about it, this one thing.<span>  </span>The memory—even just a hint of it—makes my skin cringe all at once, like a sheet ripped from the line.<span>  </span>I was ten when my mother decided to foster Derrick.<span>  </span>My father had just left us—a trial separation everyone knew would last.<span>  </span>My mother needed a project.<span>  </span>I’m not sure how we qualified; maybe she lied on the forms, maybe she and my father had interviewed before he left.<span>  </span>Derrick was fourteen, skinny and big-eyed.<span>  </span>He’d been beaten up at the group home, probably because of his willowy build, the way his hands tapered like a girl’s. He arrived with a black eye and a brown duffle bag.<span>  </span>My mother set him up in the room that used to be my father’s study.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">In the first weeks, Derrick drew into himself like a sea snail snatched from its rock.<span>  </span>And his silence lured out of my mother a warm, maternal heat.<span>  </span>“How was school?” she’d ask him in a way that she never asked me, her eyes damp and curious, her mouth parted in anticipation.<span>  </span>He’d mumble fine, and try and walk away, but she’d try harder, following him with questions about his homework, his school supplies, sports, and friends.<span>  </span>She urged me to sit next to him at dinner, to ask him to go swimming at the Y.<span>  </span>She assigned the two of us chores to do in tandem—planting a berry patch out back, reorganizing the pots beneath the stove.<span>  </span>When he wasn’t around, she asked me my opinion.<span>  </span>How did I think he was doing?<span>  </span>Did he say anything to me about being happy or sad?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">It makes sense to me now.<span>  </span>She wasn’t playing favorites.<span>  </span>She was trying to make up for the world’s bad temper, compensate for Derrick’s hard luck, put some pennies in his cosmic bank. She must have known, as I didn’t, that his mother wouldn’t get out of jail, that Derrick would spend the next years in a world of unstable charity.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Derrick stayed away from me as much as he could.<span>  </span>He understood that he was treading on someone else’s turf.<span>  </span>If I came in to talk to my mother while the two of them watched television, he’d get up and go to his room.<span>  </span>Once—how this came to pass, I can’t recall—he let me sit on his bed and read the comic books he stored in the nightstand.<span>  </span>He stood at the mirror and asked me if he should cut off the long floppy bangs that shielded his eyes.<span>  </span>I liked him in that moment.<span>  </span>I felt important—let into a world of older kids and their concerns.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">My mother tried and tried.<span>  </span>She bought him new shirts, the baggy shorts all the boys were wearing, even a skateboard. But she couldn’t quite get him to relax.<span>  </span>He ate his meals quietly and rinsed his plate.<span>  </span>He kept all his clothes neatly stacked in the drawers, his duffle bag folded atop the dresser.<span>  </span>It was as if he expected, at any moment, to have to leave.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">One Saturday, a couple of months after he arrived, she told me she wanted to take him out to the lake, just the two of them.<span>  </span>Nature might do him good.<span>  </span>I’d understand, right?<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I went to my friend Jenny’s house, but I remember the feeling of that day so clearly.<span>  </span>I was a ringing thing, a bell chiming out into a windy sky.<span>  </span>Jenny left me in her bedroom, confused by my unwillingness to play, and I quietly ripped the tail off a stuffed squirrel near her bed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">That night, my mother tucked me in.<span>  </span>I tried to tell her about it, that I didn’t feel well, that I’d ripped Jenny’s toy squirrel and hidden it in a closet.<span>  </span>“You’ll survive, sweetie,” she said, and patted my head.<span>  </span>I wasn’t even finished talking when she called me a trooper and left the room.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">It began again, the feeling of being a bell in a big wind.<span>  </span>I waited until I heard her close the door to her bathroom, turn on the faucet, open a drawer.<span>  </span>The tile was cold under my feet.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“What’s wrong?” she asked.<span>  </span>Her mouth was bare of lipstick, flecked with the faintest white toothpaste.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I could have said that I missed her.<span>  </span>That I missed my dad. That every penny I threw into the well at the mall was about them, about having them back.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">But instead, I twisted my hands together.<span>  </span>I said that Derrick came into my room at night.<span>  </span>I watched her face contract, then loosen into a surface as smooth as a plate.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“What?” she asked.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“He touches himself,” I said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">My mother knelt down, staring into my eyes.<span>  </span>“Are you telling me the truth?” she asked.<span>  </span>I could have burst into tears, admitted my lie. I nodded.<span>  </span>She tucked my hair away from my cheek.<span>  </span>“Did he touch you?” she asked, her voice a strong whisper.<span>  </span>I shook my head.<span>  </span>She kept her hand on my cheek.<span>  </span>She closed her eyes.<span>  </span>Then she reached out and pulled me to her, smoothing the back of my head.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I’m sorry,” she said, finally.<span>  </span>“I’m sorry.<span>  </span>Sometimes people go through things inside that they don’t show everyone.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">She walked me to bed and held my hand and the heat from it seemed to shoot directly into my face.<span>  </span>“I didn’t know,” she whispered.<span>  </span>“I didn’t know.”<span>  </span>I knew she was crying, though I’d shut my eyes so tightly, the silver eyespots swarmed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Derrick was gone that afternoon.<span>  </span>Drawers and closet empty, borrowed bed turned on its side.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">My mother returned to me.<span>  </span>I got her back.<span>  </span>She never fostered another child.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">What did Derrick think when my mother drove him back to the social worker?<span>  </span>Left him there with his duffel and an envelope of money?<span>  </span>I don’t know if my mother explained her reasons, or if she simply said she wasn’t cut out for raising other people’s kids.<span>  </span>In twenty-four years, we’ve never uttered his name—as if we can make him disappear from our past.<span>  </span>As if by acting like the world can’t hurt us, we will make it so.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I’m still in the car.<span>  </span>A roll of thunder, then a clap.<span>  </span>The noise happens once in the sky, then silently with feeling through the earth. I open the door, stand in the cool wind.<span>  </span>I didn’t bring a raincoat and within seconds, the shoulders of my shirt are soaked through.<span>  </span>Cliff’s hair is flat against his skull.<span>  </span>He looks out into the gray and red, into the yellow and silver.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span> </span>The rain is loud, falling against the wood, the dirt, the trees, my face.<span>  </span>When drops hit the dusty trail, they stay risen like tiny bunkers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Cliff’s walking away from me, down into the trees.<span>  </span>His body’s small against the bleak view of peaks and I feel a wash of gratitude—for him, for the air and trees.<span>  </span>A clump of leaves lands near my foot, layers of yellow and brown.<span>  </span>I grab a handful and squeeze.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The truth is, if I had one wish right now, if I could wish on a handful of leaves—for baby Josephina, eternal life, eternal youth, domestic peace, a love that would never stray from me, never end—well, I’ve listened closely.<span>  </span>I know what happens.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span> </span>I wouldn’t wish for anything at all.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I drop the leaves and lock the door.<span>  </span>Cliff gets smaller and smaller.<span>  </span>And then I follow him down the dust paths turning to mud, into the brown, silver and yellow, into the crashing storm.<span>  </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>That day in July my mom came out of the house, wiped her soapy hands on her thighs, and told me to get my lazy bum up off the grass and go weed the peas. She wore rolled-up blue jeans, a cotton blouse, and a red bandana that tied her dark hair back from her face. Her toenails were caked with dirt and needed cutting.</p>
<p>“Don’t want to,” I said. My dad had been gone on a job for a week and it was just the two of us. In the sun the temperature read ninety; bugs swarmed around my skin and flies landed intermittently on my thighs and knees.</p>
<p>“Katie, how’d you get to be so lazy?” she said, squinting off towards the hills that used to belong to my dad’s parents, but had since been sold, and then started walking alone through the tall grass down to the garden. I watched her thin shoulder blades moving under her blouse and went back to the library book I was reading. It was about a girl who lived in a clean house in the suburbs with lots of rooms and windows. The girl wrote stories, and the book was about those stories she wrote and all those windows. I wanted to be like her: unencumbered, surrounded by light. In one story she wrote about girls who turned into birds: hawks and ravens and buzzards and crows. They could fly anywhere they wanted to go. You knew, reading, that the girl who wrote the stories was free, too, you could feel it in your bones, but I couldn’t concentrate anymore, with my skinny mom walking down to the garden alone.</p>
<p>I felt a trickle of sweat slip down my spine and thought about those weeds—tall, green, stringy—crowding out the tomatoes and peas and carrots and beans. I thought about our basement full of empty canning jars collecting dust and our Datsun with a busted starter. After a few minutes I got up and went down the hill too, kneeling down in front of the carrots and pigweed. My mom didn’t say a thing, just looked at me sideways for a moment and smiled, then went back to the peas.<br />
We lived in a house that didn’t have many windows: just a few small double-hungs in each room that we covered with plastic in winter. My dad had built the house when he was twenty: a pine-sided cabin with two bedrooms and a porch and a barn where he had hoped, someday, to keep horses. Now that barn was just a place with no walls where we kept snow tires and broken lawnmowers and old chairs that needed caning.</p>
<p>The weeds were thick and everywhere: pigweed and witch grass and dandelion. It had rained all of June and standing water pooled in-between the rows and mosquito eggs floated around in the pools. But that day was all sun. My hair fell into my face and stuck to my cheeks and the thin brown hairs on my legs shone. Wet dirt wedged under my nails and made them throb. The skin on my arms and legs burned. My mom’s arms were a nice freckled brown and she didn’t sweat. Mine were my dad’s: pink and burnable.</p>
<p>“Sing low, sweet chariot,” my mom sang, quietly and out of key. She had grown up in a big house in the suburbs, just like the girl in my book, and could have done anything with her life. Back in college she had wanted to be a poet. There were floppy books of poetry stored on a shelf in the corner of her bedroom, collecting dust. I got up and moved to the shade. I lay down and closed my eyes and thought about how a Coke or a blue Slush Puppy or a sip of my dad’s cold beer would feel on my tongue. I could hear my mom inching along through the rows. I picked a blade of grass and stuck it between my teeth and nibbled on it, let the bitter taste seep all over and then I spit it out and just lay there, feeling the cool.</p>
<p>I had the story of how they met like a movie in my mind. My dad had a job at the local college building storage sheds. It was hot and he worked with his shirt off and all the girls hung around, my mom told me, pretending to read near where he cut and hammered boards. But she was the only one to offer him a beer. He said he’d love one but swimming was an even better way to cool down. Then he winked. “You like to swim?”</p>
<p>He took her to a place in the Broad Brook called Indian Love Call and told her it was named that because Indians would bring their girlfriends there. On one side of the river a ledge outcrop rose twenty feet above the water and they carried their beers up to that rock and looked down. The water bristled with snowmelt and the boulders flashed silver in the sun. He beat his fists against his chest and made a hooting call meant to imitate an Indian and his voice echoed back. Then he took off all his clothes and leapt into the water. My mom stood there in her bohemian skirt and blouse looking down at him. He crowed and hollered and splashed and looked up at her. She laughed. “What you waiting for?” he called out.</p>
<p>“It looks cold,” she shouted above the sound of water hitting stone.</p>
<p>“Fresh!” he yelled, so my mom took off all her clothes and jumped in too. She’d never been naked in front of a man or leapt off a cliff into ice water; she said she knew right then, in midair, her life would be something entirely different than what she had imagined. I learned all this one night in the dark of my room, moonlight lighting up the side of her face as she told me.</p>
<p>“You all done?” My mom stood up, brushed her dark hair out of her face with the back of her hand and looked down at me on the grass.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Pooped,” I said, so we walked back up to the house together. The sun had settled below the trees and the sky bloomed tangerine behind the leaves. She was too thin. Lacking muscle. “Eat, woman,” my dad would say, poking her ribs. “What, you want to float away?”</p>
<p>She put some rice on the stove and started chopping kale. Every once in a while she’d glance up at the old-fashioned clock that hung on our wall and made a loud ticking sound I knew so well sometimes I couldn’t hear it when I tried. On top of the clock sat little wooden turtles and rabbits and birds my dad had carved for both of us years ago.</p>
<p>She looked again at the clock. It said seven-thirty, which meant my dad should have been back a few hours ago, which meant he and Bill, the guy he built houses with, had either broken down or were drinking six packs at the river.</p>
<p>She licked her dry lips and looked at the door. It had warped over the years and now a half-inch gap of outside light shone between the door and the frame. Once she had asked him to fix it so he took some duct tape and pasted a strip over the gap. “There,” he said, grinning, laying the duct tape on the table. The strip of tape still hung there, half peeled down, the sticky part dull with cobwebs.</p>
<p>My mom turned the tap water on and the light over the kitchen sink flickered. She had asked him for real electricity too, not the long cord strung from tree to tree through the woods up from his parents’ house that made the lights flicker every time she used the blender or ran water.  My dad just laughed and left the room when she asked for that.</p>
<p>I heard his truck coming up the driveway and went outside. When I was young we had driven that red Ford to Florida where we had camped in a tent surrounded by sand pines and cooked on a Coleman stove and my mom’s skin had turned a beautiful brown; there are pictures. There’s also a picture I took of the two of them dancing barefoot in sand, my mom’s neck tipped back in laughter.</p>
<p>My dad hopped out of the truck and came towards me. “There’s my beauty!” he called out, scooping me up and swinging me around in a circle. His eyes were bloodshot and he was grinning. He set me down and looked at the house. “How’s Lyn?”</p>
<p>We walked inside together. She didn’t look up, just kept chopping her vegetables, the knife making little scratching sounds on the board. “And beauty number two,” he said, quiet, breathing.</p>
<p>He went around the counter to where she stood and put his arms around her waist, placed his thumbs on her hipbones. “I said hello, beautiful,” he said into her ear. Then he looked at me, his eyes glistening. He was drunk, I could tell. I loved him when he was drunk; he talked to both of us this way.  My mom stopped chopping her vegetables and closed her eyes. The cotton of her shirt went up and down with her breath. Then she pushed him away with her elbow. “Go take a shower.”</p>
<p>We ate dinner at the table out in the yard: rice and greens and a can of pintos my mom opened up. She didn’t even heat them on the stove, just dumped a pile onto each of our plates. My dad got a six-pack from his truck and opened one and told us about his week. He told my mom this was the biggest house they’d ever built, that he was going to make a profit. “I’ll buy you any god-damn thing you want,” he said, grinning, leaning over and pinching my thigh.</p>
<p>My mom poured some white wine into a Bell canning jar. She took small sips and squinted out towards the view. She was doing that thing she did, I knew: trying, with her eyes, to make the hills flat, pretty. Turn them into poetry. They used to belong to my dad’s parents. Now they were just black silhouettes spotted in ugly houses, the sky behind them the blue of his and my eyes.</p>
<p>He set his beer down and looked at my mom. “Okay few days, Lyn?”</p>
<p>She took another sip of her wine. “It was alright.”</p>
<p>Their faces were just shadows. My dad leaned down and unlaced his boots, slid his feet out, rested them up on the bench between us. They were pretty like a woman’s: pale from being inside his boots all the time.</p>
<p>My mom got up and cleared the plates and took them into the kitchen. I heard water running and the kitchen light flickered. Mosquitoes swarmed around my head and bit my legs. I let one turn red with blood and then I swatted it so it left a smear on my thigh.</p>
<p>“Ugly,” my dad said, and laughed, but it was an out of proportion laugh, like he was laughing at something much funnier or not funny at all. I sat there waiting for another mosquito to land on me and fill up with blood. I thought about the girl in my book and how she didn’t think about her parents spent dreams, or weed their gardens; all she thought about was the people in the stories she wrote and herself.</p>
<p>“How about you, Katie Belle,” my dad whispered. That’s what he called me. “Doing okay?”</p>
<p>The back door slammed and I went around the side of the house. My mom was going down the hill to the garden in the near dark. She kneeled by the zucchini this time, pulling more weeds, trying to make things right. It was a losing battle; I knew. I followed and stood quiet in the shadows a few yards away. After a few minutes she stopped weeding and bent over and put her face in her hands. Her shoulders started to shake. I looked at the view and then at my toes and then back at her. The shadows of her shoulder blades started moving around under her skin. The skin of her back stretched out until it was gleaming, nearly translucent. Large pointy things, the length of my legs, began moving around, poking through her ribs and skin.</p>
<p>“Mom,” I called out, my voice too loud in that dark.</p>
<p>She looked up at me. Her eyes hazy, viscous, blank. Those things on her back were iridescent, dark feathered wings.</p>
<p>Then a look of recognition passed through her. “Oh. Hi.” Those wings disappeared. Stopped pulsing there. She had been crying but she looked beautiful. “Want to help, Kate?”</p>
<p>My heart was electric but I went and knelt next to her. It was the only thing I knew how to do. We pulled until it was so dark we could no longer tell the difference between one thing and another: unearthing spinach and carrots and beans. A firefly flew into her blouse and started blinking in there. She laughed and tugged the cotton away from her chest and the bug flew out. Then she put her arms around me and held me to her. She smelled like dish soap and earth, but something strange and sour that I’d never smelled before, too. All around us crickets were finding their partners. I thought about my dad up there drunk at that table and how I’d always be like him: wingless, from here.</p>
<p>“You cold?” she asked. She started shaking and I could feel those wings again, behind me, trembling under the surface of her skin.</p>
<p>“No,” I lied. The night air was warm but I was freezing. Only where she touched me was I warm. Her breath was sour, uneven, scented of wine. On the horizon the moon started to come up through the trees: just a sliver, then disappeared behind the tops of the hemlocks and the pines.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%;"><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/02/Replacement-Parts-recording.mp3">Replacement Parts recording</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Drake lived in our shed for a month during the summer. At least that’s what we called it. The shed, our shack, a hut held up by the air itself. Not that it matters much out here, where everything seems made from sun and sand. Colton, Iowa isn’t just where two counties cross paths; it’s also where one drought seems to turn into another, doubling up the heat. An unincorporated community of thirty-nine on the border between the towns of Dexter and Gooding, it was once the solitary way station on a road to nowhere, but since the Interstate arrived it’s now just a place separated by a quiet two-lane highway, a gas station, and a pile of double-wides feeding off lost travelers. In other words, it’s no place for a pretty girl to be raised, which is why for class photos my mother used to dress me so you couldn’t tell me apart from other short-haired schoolboys: overalls covering every inch of skin, long-toed sneakers enveloping my feet like second-hand clown shoes. But this year, as sixteen rolled around, there was no hiding anymore. With the lanky legs and generous chest, I became a reluctant member of the girl race, forever and ever, amen.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>In fact, before she died this summer, I’d catch Mom gazing at me, eyes slit and shaking her head, almost as if blaming my body—healthy and spreading—for the cancer eating her from the inside out. In the past, she wouldn’t want me around much anyway, which felt like a blessing of sorts, especially when she came back from the bar with men searching for a bed. Regardless of the reports every few years about missing girls, women foolishly following strangers into the fields, these men still wound up in our trailer. But when the lumps were detected last year, and the men began to look me up and down instead, Mom would offer the car keys and tell me to drive somewhere else. Still some nights I’d accidentally walk in on them. And despite the first impulse to run, I couldn’t help stare. She was beautiful back then. Thick legs straddling a waist, her hands touching her own curves, eyes shut as if she were alone. I’d silently back out of the room, nobody ever even knowing I was there, and listen to the various boys make their noises down the hall throughout the nights, only to leave the next morning like a quick mist.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I almost miss her in those moments—the way she moved like water while making love—as opposed to the way many will remember her right before she passed. The way her blouses suddenly sat flat against her, the way she rubbed vitamin E into the scars, and the way it didn’t even matter when six months later everything had already settled into her bones. And it’s hard not to blame Colton itself—so far away from any kind of help—for her running out of options and time. But the last few months, when her boyfriends came by she still made me trace her lips in red and slather on the bright-blue eye shadow. I dressed her in the leopard-print blouses, as well as the flame-red pants that once sucked in her skin and now hung loose on her hips. Then she’d send me away again. But it’s when my Dad finally arrived back on the scene that she demanded I stick around, treat him nice, as if we were finally a family once more.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>When Dad pulled up on a cloud of motorcycle fumes, I figured he was just another lover come to pay their respects. But then I saw his freshly shaved face and knew he was different. He looked like a rock star, a cowboy, something from TV. Nothing like other bikers who stopped for gas and beer on their way to the desert. This guy walked at a faster clip. He didn’t smell like 30-weight oil. And he seemed sober when strolling through our gate.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in">“This Susan’s place?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I led him inside and pointed to her room. He nodded and said I was just as pretty as ever. Mom slept most of the time, the fatigue often overtaking her so suddenly you could spend moments talking to yourself before realizing her eyes were shut. So it wasn’t long until he was out on the porch again, asking me if I recalled his face.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I shook my head. “She’s only got a few days left. I’d save it for her.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Pretty tough, huh?” His shaggy blond hair fluttered like ribbon in the wind.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Maybe. Maybe not.” I dug at the grit under my toenails. The streetlights were coming on and the neon signs around town slowly came into focus: <em>Beer. Gas. Vacancy.</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">He sat down next to me, his leathers creaking like a worn-out chair, and put his arm around my shoulders. But his hand didn’t wander like most of the guys who visited. He smelled like sweat and spearmint gum, saying, “Yeah, you look tough enough. Just like your mama.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>When Drake first came through our trailer court, dreads hanging like a bead curtain down his back and looking lost, I quickly saw a strange echo of myself. A face full of lonesomeness as he lingered up and down the lane, one moment leaning against a light pole then gone entirely. At first he just watched from afar like I was a model demonstrating how it all works. This is how we eat cereal on the porch. This is when you’re supposed to go to bed and how to avoid it. This is how we dress while working at the gas station: <em>Hello, My Name is Hannah</em>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Then one morning, he at last appeared on our stoop, the sun already electric.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“What’s your name?” I asked, sneaking up behind as if he were a feral stray.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>He didn’t flinch, didn’t even turn around. “If you want me to leave, ask nice.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Did I say that?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">His black braids were like little anchors holding his head in place. When he stood, I saw a face not much older than mine, eyes like ice chips. He held out a hand. “What’s <em>your</em> name?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“I asked first.” I put my hand inside his but didn’t shake. Our clasp hung there between us like a prayer gone unanswered. We were two bronzed statues, my skin naturally tanned from living in this endless oven of a town, but his was different. Almost like chocolate but sunnier than that, as if a light emanated from within his body, turning his dark skin bright.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%;">“I thought only black people had hair like that.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>His hand never let go of mine. He nodded, staring down at my chest. “You’re beautiful.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>I squinted back, a common kind of expression around here. “You’re weird.” I pulled back my hand. He didn’t try to hold on. “Don’t you have somewhere else to be?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“I don’t know,” he said. “Seems like a good place to be.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“You kidding? It’s like 100 degrees out here. And it’s not through yet.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>His crooked teeth tumbled through the smile. They looked like a bunch of sharp rocks falling in front of one another. “It’s perfect. Don’t you think?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>I didn’t though. I had absolutely no idea what to think.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>After the funeral, Dad stuck around. My mother’s last request. It wasn’t a scary offer. In fact, it was a comfort of sorts. His face wasn’t hungry. There was no anger in his bones. He even kept his eyes to himself. Actually, he looked so soft and sweet it felt like having a pet.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%;">And as soon as she was buried, Dad said it was time to get rid of the clutter. “Past is nothing but a road block,” he said, throwing Mom’s skirts and stilettos in a garbage bag.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Maybe I wanted those,” I said, knowing that wasn’t true.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“People offer good money for these things.” I wasn’t sure which people he was referring to, but it was nice to have an adult around for once, taking care any way he saw fit. He put on rubber gloves to touch her sheets, the empty vials of hydrocodone, the half-filled water glasses that could never fully quench her thirst. I told him cancer wasn’t contagious, but he kept right on holding his breath until the trash sack was out of sight on the other side of our fence.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">That night he left. I figured he was gone for good—another part-time parent. Then two days later he walked back into the trailer and opened a beer. I didn’t ask where he’d been, knowing silence was the best way to keep talking to one another. But he must have seen the question in my face when he winked at me. “I was trying to find you a new mom.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I laughed. “They were never in large supply around here.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Dad touched my hand, offered me his beer. I waved it away and witnessed the lost look on his face. But he just didn’t get it. One mother had been enough. Another just felt like replacement parts.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Since summers were dangerous, Dad traded a couple of things for a plastic pool we sat in most afternoons, spraying ourselves with the withered garden hose when the sweat was too much. I soaked in a bikini while Dad dipped his feet in the water, dozing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Drake usually watched from across the street until one day we saw him drag a couch down our lane, cutting a small path in the gravel. He couldn’t get the sofa through our gate. We watched him struggle to lift it over the chain-link. When that didn’t work, he left it in the road and took a seat on our porch wearing dirty khakis, his hiking boots all but torn in two.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Too big,” he said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Dad sprayed his knees and said, “If you want a day job, stealing isn’t it.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I didn’t steal it.” Drake licked his lips and grinned. “It was just laying there.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Dad nodded. “You definitely have a criminal’s mind.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The couch had been out for so long nobody would even know it was missing. One thing we weren’t short on was spare furniture acting as lawn ornaments. But nobody paid much mind out here, our town never more than a pit stop, a quick blur from one end to the other. So I helped Drake lift the couch on the porch. None of the springs were broken yet. Perfect for sunset-sitting. That night Drake and I watched the purple overcome the sky when he finally asked about Mom.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“She’s not around anymore.” I crossed my arms under the shelf of my breasts, pushing them together. It was hard to know exactly what to do with them sometimes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Mine neither,” he said. “My dad went back below the border. Said he’d bring my uncle and they’d start an auto shop. That was a month ago.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“About the time my mom took off as well.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“You’re lucky to still have <em>him</em> around.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I wasn’t so sure. Dad sealed a leak in our roof, though no rain had fallen for months. He raked our gravel. He even put up a basketball hoop at the dead end of our street for all the trailer kids. It simply stood there, alone and idle like a lightning rod, a spare spine that nobody needed hanging around.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“He’s pretty new to all this,” I said. “We’re more like roommates.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span> </span>“I’d take a roommate.” The tone in his voice was all but begging to stay, even if just for a bit. But I wouldn’t ask that of him. I liked him too much already, and he’d be better off moving to another town where waiting around wasn’t your only option.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%;">Drake didn’t show for a few days and I figured he’d caught my drift. At first it was hard, cutting our ties. For a place where goodbyes were a way of life, I couldn’t shake the sadness—a misbegotten boy, put upon and left behind. But when he reappeared a few days later dragging a large rug down the lane, I knew he wasn’t going anywhere.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span> </span>Dad was impressed. “Resourceful little thing, isn’t he?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I splashed water on my legs that sprouted wiry dark hairs even though I was bleach-blond up top. Dad helped pull the rug over the fence. It smelled bad and looked stained. That’s when he offered Drake the shed. “Not much but a place to keep out of the sun.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Drake scratched his elbow, dry and ashy. “My dad will be looking for me.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Sure, sure. Just in the meantime. With a gift like yours, it’s best to stay under cover.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Drake said he didn’t pickpocket, didn’t shoplift. <em>He was a good kid,</em> he kept telling us.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span><span> </span>“You <em>are</em> a good kid,” Dad agreed. “With brown skin.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Drake looked at the couch he’d offered in exchange for some company. And now here he was being handed a new home, even if it was out back in a shack. “What’s the catch?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Dad came up behind me and laid his hands on my shoulders. His grip was cold, as if those fingers were made from some strange element, a small frost foreign around these parts.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“What you think, Hannah? Isn’t it about time you had a brother around here?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>I didn’t say yes or no. I couldn’t even shrug under his touch. I just stared at Drake, my dark-skinned twin, and knew our little family had just gotten one boy bigger.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;" align="center">***</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Mom never said a word about Dad. All my life I heard about how no father gone missing was worth the time it took to speak his name. And his absence was larger than any one body could ever fill. Probably why there were so many men around with their gleaming bikes and rusty beards, guys with watery tattoos smearing their skin, playing tough-guy. At the gas station, I’d see them come and go as if through a turnstile. Each the same as the rest: hard shelled and licking their chops as I moved from one pump to the next. It was also probably why I was still a virgin. Whenever I took a man’s money and his winks, they all had bottomless eyes that could break your heart real easy if you let them.<span>  </span>But my mom, on the other hand, couldn’t stop herself.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">For only being forty, my mother appeared twenty years older. I’d seen pictures of her when she was in school, looking more like myself than I’d like to admit. But I still remember in junior high when I felt the first trickle run down my leg. I thought I’d peed my pants until I saw all that red coming out of me. I ran to the nurse, thinking I was dying, until she told me about becoming a woman. That it was a proud moment. That it was part of our burden and blessing. Except when I told my mother, she simply rolled her eyes and sighed and said she didn’t need another woman around stealing her show. She tried to smile, like it was a joke, but a year later when the men began to watch me as I walked out of a room, I knew it wasn’t a funny at all.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">But despite the wear and tear, before long Mom would have everyone staring at her simply by smiling. Men paid her tabs in exchange for a little attention. She wasn’t just a mother to me but to every man who set sight on her, took her in their arms. I had all the big brothers I could handle, each one of them gone by the break of sun, heading off into that barren fields where all the rest of the bodies are buried. And though she’s gone I still feel her close by, as if wandering the wilderness, but still it’s hard to remember much. At one point she was full of life and the next she’d simply let the cancer take over like a permanent passerby. Sometimes when I try to think back, it feels as if she’d never really been there. Like some kind of mirage that only hungry, half-dying men could see from afar but up close quickly vanished. At hand she was nowhere to be found but from a distance across the room she looked good enough to drink.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The first day of July, the thermometer ready to pop, another film crew rolled through. They always chose the worst time of year, our town teeming with heat waves and government warnings. At the station, as they filled their tanks, Drake slipped behind the counter with me as if leery of strangers. Most days he’d stay behind with Dad. When I was around, they spent most of their time trading war stories about the road, though none of their tales added up to much or gave any kind of hint about where they’d actually been. By the time I got home, they’d usually gone to bed, probably tired from talking themselves in circles. But today Drake tagged along, looking pale and full of the fidgets. I figured the heat was finally getting to him.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%;">A guy wearing a Hawaiian shirt came in and took out a credit card. I gave it a swipe, and as the machine added up its numbers and sent them up to the satellites I studied the vans outside.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Hollywood wasn’t an uncommon sight. Iowa gave tax relief for them to come and make our state look good, add to tourism. So a few times a year they arrived and left a tip or two before moving on. Sometimes they stayed overnight to get a taste of local flavor, and Roy—who owned the station and bar across the street—tried to play host as best he knew how. But there were never real celebrities, at least none I recognized from the magazine covers spread around the store.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Anybody famous this time?” I asked.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“It isn’t that kind of movie,” the man said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Drake sat up slowly. “What kind of movie is it?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“The no-budget kind.” The grip winked that same old wink. “Something about farmers growing pot, a Mexican cartel, and drug deal gone bad.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“You guys have some funny ideas about places,” Drake said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“The script says we’re also supposed to be in Pennsylvania.” Mr. Hollywood shrugged and signed the receipt with a squiggle. “What you going to do?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I took the carbon copy from his hand. “I like comedies better.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Me too,” he said, eyes lingering here then there. “With happy <em>endings</em>.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I felt my skin heat up. Drake stood with a newfound anger in his face that was hard to not be flattered by. “I think it’s time for you to leave,” he said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The man offered a little laugh. “All right, kid. All right.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">When he was gone, Drake said, “They don’t know a thing about deals gone bad.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Who cares about what they do or don’t know?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“But what right do they have?” Drake glared at me and I felt ashamed, though of what I wasn’t sure. “Coming here to tell us how we live.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I laced my fingers in his, a small attempt to calm him but also say <em>thank you</em>. Except at the first touch he quickly took his hand back as if suddenly stung by some unknown source.<span>  </span><a name="_GoBack"></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">“Do you go to school?” I asked one afternoon, the sky in the distance dark-clouded and full of menace, threatening to pour down a rain that never seemed to come.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“No. It just a bunch of facts. Nothing a real person needs,” he said, still panting from the game. Drake and Dad spent most mornings playing basketball, a one-on-one matchup that each day began innocently enough but eventually verged upon violence. They never kept score, never called fouls, but the ongoing tournament lasted hours at a time, each guarding the other so close you soon couldn’t tell one sweat-soaked body from the other. Usually Drake was the first to tap out, calling it quits when Dad began to almost wrestle the poor kid to the ground. As we sat together, the boy was still shaking from the game, always unnerved by Dad’s sudden strength.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“A diploma gets you away quicker. That’s what Mom said.” I recalled the rasp of her voice taken over by cancer and couldn’t help but smile, though it didn’t feel right on my mouth.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“She sounds smart.” Drake sweated under that bulk of hair like he didn’t know any better. The dreads were like a fur pelt that needed a good shave. There’s a reason every living thing out here with hair hides from the sun during the day—in this heat, we’ve all overcome the need to be human. But Drake seemed to lack a certain ability to adapt and it’d get him in trouble someday. And it’s what I liked best about him.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“What was your mom like?” I asked, sitting in our pool and splashing my skin.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Drake simply looked at the horizon as if an answer was out there amongst the sagebrush and soil. He wore one of Dad’s Harley shirts, but his boots still looked liable to crumble, as if asking to be put out of their misery</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The breeze whipped dirt around. The sun had baked my skin a deep cherry, cooking me pink all the way through. “We should go in. Wind’s going to be bad tonight.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">He gripped the chair, like a branch set to snap. Like something about to detonate at the sound of a say-so. I wrapped a towel around myself and walked behind him, stroking the strings of his hair. They didn’t seem connected to anything actual, just a bunch of floating cables like snakes in my hand. I wondered how long it’d take for someone like me to make hair like that.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Ever think about doing something with this?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">He shook his head, the fat ropes of his hair barely slithering.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I pressed myself against the back of his neck. “Wouldn’t a trim feel better?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Then nobody would recognize me anymore.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I would,” I whispered in his ear. I made my fingers into a pair of scissors, placed a braid between, and feigned a cut until Drake grabbed my wrist and told me to stop.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Who’d have thought he’d felt a thing through that deep network of hairy roots. And I was sorry until he finally let go, leaving a faint bruise on my skin. When he stormed into the house, I wondered who this guy thought he was. Or who I wished him to be. But before I could figure it, the wind rose up and blew over our pool as if I’d been the only thing holding it down all along.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By late July, Drake and Dad slept most of the day. In the evening, after a late shift pumping gas, I’d come home to them on the couch, heads together as if getting ready to sell something to somebody. When I opened the door, they’d break apart and tip their beer cans a bit too casually.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“How was work?” Dad asked, scratching his three-day stubble. He stank like a fish tank.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Six hours and only two customers.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Pathetic,” Dad said. “Not even enough to cover Garret’s electric bill.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Enough to pay <em>ours</em>.” I rubbed my feet as if they ached, though the truth was I sat most nights reading material for classes I going to take this fall at the local community college. I wanted to be ready when I graduated from Roosevelt High, a consolidated school one town over. Sometimes I wondered if my body was trying to keep up with my mind, aggressive in every way.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“What’s that supposed to mean?” Drake asked.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“It means that if you two spent more time finding work than fucking around, we could afford something nice instead of dragging it down the street.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">They stared at each other as if outed at last. Dad hardly left the house anymore, so Drake and I never had a solitary second together. Both of us quietly kept waiting on our fathers, hoping someday they’d come around and take us away from this beach with no sign of water in sight.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Dad said, a cigarette hanging from his lip. They kept a fresh carton in the freezer. The air was filled with a thin haze.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I’m <em>sure</em> you don’t,” I said, standing for punctuation before stomping down the hall.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 2.25pt;">Before sleep, I’d take a cold bath to keep me from running hot. Underwater, my body puckered, I’d picture Drake watching me. Like him witnessing these changes in me would somehow prove their happening, as if maybe his showing up was a way to remind me things moved on. Or maybe stayed the same. Sometimes, when I looked in the mirror, I saw shades of both my parents in me. Their heart-shaped features, the square fit of their shoulders, a thickness about my skin. My reflection a shadowed attempt at imitation, like when combining two pure forms of a chemical and you only end up with a diluted replica of the former—a copy of a photocopy. How they were able to work their looks to get exactly what they wanted seemed beyond me.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 2.25pt; text-indent: 33.75pt;">But tonight, when I wrapped up in a towel and watched myself in the glass—with that long hair covered up, the figure finally out of the way—my own face actually came into focus for once. I imagined Drake’s sky-eyes on me again and thought about what our first time together would be like. And though ridiculous, part of me hoped when we made love, naked and entwined in his hair, we wouldn’t actually have to touch. There wouldn’t even be kissing. In fact, maybe he wouldn’t get hard like guys at school, the biker boys at the pumps. Twins weren’t like that. Instead, we would be lovers without the longing. Isn’t that what true lovers were really supposed to be, after all: people in need without all that unnecessary neediness?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;" align="center">***</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the summer, sleep is miracle enough with the air smothering you like a quilt. Some nights I’d wake suffocating, a small dream twisted in the back of my mind like twine. I’d listen to Drake out back in the shed, snoring as if under the spell of a gentle drug. Except tonight when I woke, it felt like something had been put back out of place. A lock left unlatched, a candle let to burn. But in the kitchen, the dishes still sat in the sink, empties rested on the table. Outside the sun peeked over the horizon. The world looked dusky and new as I approached the noiseless shed. I wondered if this was it. The moment right before the moment I’d join together with the only boy I’d ever found familiar—a lover without family or memory or any of those other obligations. I pictured Drake on the other side of the wall, drenched in sweat, troubled by the same dreams.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">But when I opened the door, his cot was empty. My heart went limp, thinking it’d happened again. What was it with this family where even a replacement part had the urge to leave without a word? No forwarding address. Just another unspoken goodbye.<span>  </span>Back inside, the trailer felt empty except for the dust that got into every crevice. I crossed my arms. Sometimes I couldn’t even feel my own heartbeat through all that extra baggage. Where did it all come from, the sudden stuff growing inside you until it can’t be ignored, or contained, anymore?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Then I heard it. Recently, nights were filled with sad, sparse sounds coming from my father’s room. They weren’t strong cries, but small moans—strange in their slightness. I slowly opened the door to see if he was sniveling in his sleep but, despite the dark, it was easy to tell it wasn’t weeping. These were living noises. Desperation had never had such distinct timbre, a clear-cut quality that could only be created by two things turning into one. I wanted to slam the door but instead stood there, watching those frayed black braids wrestle a man’s desire. It didn’t look beautiful or satisfying. It looked dangerous, almost brutal. Cruel in the way they moved, like a need suddenly turned vicious—a useless craving that no wish could ever fully quench.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I walked outside, the heat on my face feeling good for once, and picked up a basketball. The rubber was worn down, air slightly flat, but otherwise it felt whole in my hand. I bounced it on the dirt and I wondered how long it’d been going on. But there was the way looked at one another. The way they were always smiling. I figured it wasn’t much of a conspiracy. Their discretion so evident it wasn’t even worth the whispering, when the front door opened and a clump of dreads slinked out.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Want to shoot a few?” I asked.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Drake froze like he couldn’t be seen as long as he didn’t move. “What are you doing up?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">“Too hot to sleep.” I couldn’t help a smirk. “How was your night?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">“Still tired.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I bet.” I rolled the ball on my fingertip, but it didn’t last long before toppling.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Drake raised his brow but kept acting like nothing happened, the lie getting buried deeper until it wasn’t there at all. I felt like a child removed from the family secret.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">He took the ball from my hands and shot a jumper. It missed by a mile.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I guess it’s not my game, huh?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I grabbed the ball, gave it a bounce. “What <em>is</em> your game, exactly?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“What do you want from me?” Drake crossed his arms. He stood shockingly still, like he’d stopped breathing on purpose just to prove he could. “It’s like you’re waiting for me to do something. But I don’t have anything. You understand? Nothing.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I drilled another shot, rebounded, and passed him the ball. He didn’t move, letting himself get hit. I picked it up again. “C’mon. Shoot it.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I threw the ball as hard as I could, the sound like a hammer strike against his skin.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Drake watched the ball roll to a stop. Then, before walking away, he simply shook his head and said, “Why is it people who have something never understand about nothing?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I sat at the kitchen table wondering if Mom would’ve been on to them from the start. Or maybe she knew all along. Maybe that’s why I’d liked these boys so much, why she wanted to keep Dad around in the first place: for the simple fact that I wouldn’t have to worry about the clutter when it came to most men and their messes. And though she was wrong, when it came to any kind of intimacy—even when recalling my mother’s face as she drifted off with not even a daughter’s love to keep her company—I also knew families could do a lot worse.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Around noon, Dad walked out of the bedroom without his shirt, his hair spiked, a sleepy grin on his face. “How you doing, honey?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Thinking about Mom.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>He poured a mug of coffee, nodding as he whistled through his teeth. “Quite a woman, your mom. I’ll never forget when I first met her. Wild as the wind.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Though I knew the dangers of bringing up the past, knew the dead ends they shaped, I went ahead and asked it anyway. “Did you know she was having a baby?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span><span> </span>“We had our time together and that was that.” He nodded again and took a seat at the table. “But yeah, I knew. Not right away, but eventually.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>I waited for him to finish, to give some kind of excuse, some kind of reason. But instead he just drank his coffee, still nodding his head.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I wonder what it would’ve been like it we had had <em>our</em> time together?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Dad stared at his mug, tapping his fingers against its rim. “We’re having it now.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span><span> </span>“Yeah. But where the hell have you been?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>He stood, hitched his jeans, and drank his coffee. “What can I tell you? It is what it is.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“What kind of answer is that?” I asked, not quite sure what I wanted from him exactly, what answer would have been the right one. There was no way to win with that kind of question. But it felt like he was looking for a way off the hook, one I wanted to keep him on a bit longer. Except my words only made him laugh under his breath and walk back to bed, but not before telling me, once again, how I was just like my mother.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Drake sat out on the porch all morning, not talking to me. I had to be at work soon, but for now I sat in our pool wearing my bikini, trying to think of the thing that’d make him say something.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“You know he’ll be leaving soon now.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The boy didn’t respond, as if he knew different, as if waiting for me to leave him alone.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I sprayed my arms, leaned back in the water, and let the sun reflect off my skin. “He had a place to rest his head, but things are getting a little tight. And he’ll make plans. Without us.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Drake didn’t make a move until I at last reached back and unclasped my top, letting my breasts breath in the air. “But you don’t have to go, you know.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">He sat there, trying not to look. But when I finally captured his gaze, all he did was roll his eyes as if trying not to laugh. “Hannah, we’re trying to make this easy on you.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">And when I looked up and saw my father’s face staring at me from the kitchen window, I knew plans had already been made. And sitting there in a plastic pool, my breasts looked suddenly silly, like a cartoon of a body that didn’t quite fit.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I slowly stood and covered myself with a towel. “You don’t have to do that.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Drake’s skin was red; his face an angry stone. As I walked inside, I couldn’t help to run my hands through his thick hair once more before quietly telling him it was, at last, time to leave.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Inside, Dad met me at the door, looking younger, something resembling the first time I saw him: clean shaven and soaked in smell-good and holding a saddlebag.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Where are you going?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I have things to take care of.” But when I saw the unsure look about his face, as if he didn’t know where to put his eyes, I knew this wasn’t a trip—it was a get-away.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I pulled the towel tighter around myself. “Can I come with you?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Dad went to touch my bare shoulder. But his hand hesitated above my skin, wet and tan, fingers hovering there—as if he wasn’t sure to yell at me or hug me, give a lecture or not say a word—until he finally pulled back and shouldered his bag. “You’d be better off without us.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Us?” At first the word felt familiar, almost pretty. Like maybe it meant me, maybe mom as well, until I saw that it only included him. And a lost boy with no strings attached.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“You come from strong stock.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I didn’t get it from you.” Then I tried to think of what else Mom would do—laugh at him, slap him, curse his name—when I all wanted was to throw my arms around him, bury my face into his leather vest, smell the raw warmth living there. But I didn’t do that either.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“You’ll be fine.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Will I?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Dad stopped at the door, the handle already in his hand. “Then you’ll make do.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I stood on the porch watching him help Drake onto his bike. Dad gave it a kick, the engine flaring to life, as he said something to the boy holding onto his back. Drake shrugged and smiled and cautiously waved to me, as if uncertain of what the goodbye was all about as they tore down the road, mindlessly spraying gravel left and right, to and fro.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Tonight the bath is cold. The sun and heat won’t rub off. It sits on my skin, radiating from within, a place that can’t be touched with water. Drops drip from the faucet, the porcelain rough with scum. I close my eyes and think about what’s missing. Though everything’s here—the couch, a poor excuse for a rug—the one thing I wasn’t ready for when I walked in after work was this strange silence, as if the very air has been stolen from beneath me.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>I picture two men on the back of a bike, strangers who found a way out and took it for what it was worth, even if it wasn’t much. I try to find comfort there, that maybe I had a hand in making a new something for out of all this nothing. My breasts float like buoys in the water. It’s a sad sight and again I’m curious what Mother would think. How the very thing that kept people in her life had failed her own daughter. Like that first day Dad showed and she almost looked alive again. She didn’t even seem sick, slipping her skeletal body into my old clothes that were too small for me now but fit her like a quick road to recovery. Until one day she pulled me close, took out a tube of lipstick, and said to never let him go, not like she had. But before she had a chance to improve a thing about me, I gave her a cutting glare, told her how desperation wasn’t becoming on her, and walked out the room. And when she passed away that evening, only her old lover by her side, I knew it’d be me who asked him to stay. If simply for a way to say sorry.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">But this is better. Put out to pasture—a story we understood all too well. So tonight I’ll lie in my mother’s bed, share the same sleep, sweating out dreams. I try to guess about them, those dreams. How they often seem so real but wrong: a replica of a place where you’re not entirely you but close to it. Like an out of body experience between two worlds, both of which you can see but can’t quite touch. I hope I have that kind of dream again, where waking and sleeping feel like the same pursuit. But before sleep comes the heat. It’s something to depend on around here. The one thing you can rely upon when everything else seems to melt and evaporate.</p>
