&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(&#8220;The songs trail away in the wind&#8221;)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&#8212; O Kuhler Wald</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Johannes Brahms, <em>Opus 72, no. 3</em></p>
<p>I am sorry to disturb you so late in the evening.<br />
You see, I&#8217;d forgotten to say what I came for earlier.<br />
It is lovely tonight, isn&#8217;t it?  The soft rushing<br />
of wind through the leaves before they turn<br />
incites the air with misgivings about the season.</p>
<p>I imagine there are as many ways to end a story<br />
as there are to end a day,<br />
with the awaited storm, agitation<br />
that alternately lifts the soul up, then terrifies,<br />
or the slow blue hours of nightfall, coolness<br />
that seems less like something falling on earth<br />
than something taken away.</p>
<p>I never believed in falling in love.<br />
I&#8217;ve known too much of the tyranny of lust.<br />
Yet my hand can scarcely near your wrist<br />
without the trembling of sinews that have caressed ivory keys.<br />
This wave of tenderness strangles the heart.</p>
<p>Surely you must know how I feel.<br />
I give these notes to the voice of another<br />
when always it is what <em>I</em> feel,<br />
your coming close, then drifting away . . . .<br />
Let us walk awhile under the dimming streetlights<br />
in sober introspection.  About these songs,<br />
bodiless words and music speaking to each other.</p>

the siding like a salt-eaten wreck.<span>  </span>The whole house,<br />
sunk in its center, tugged under, the porch’s edges</p>
<p>curling in June.  And still I want to trace my fingers<br />
through the dust of these closed and failing rooms.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Italy, May, 2011</p>
<p>We’ve been in Bogliasco a week<br />
before we understand the bird that’s wakened us<br />
each miserably early morning is a nightingale.</p>
<p>I am pleased by this just as I was years ago,<br />
when I had my picture taken in Rome,<br />
kneeling next to the gravestone of John Keats.</p>
<p>Every time I look at that picture, I think, There I am, kneeling<br />
next to the gravestone of John Keats.  And this week,<br />
wakened every dark morning before four, I think,</p>
<p>I’m hearing the same kind of bird Keats wrote of, at Hampstead,<br />
in one of the great odes of 1819, and it makes me a little sad<br />
to confess that of them all I love the nightingale ode least.</p>
<p>Even the bird’s singing—fulsome and musical,<br />
especially in the still-dark Ligurian morning—<br />
does not appeal to me as it did to Keats.  At this deep blue</p>
<p>and aubadial hour, it’s too loud.  And too much.<br />
But then, so is the fact that on Bartleby.com,<br />
right there on my screen next to Keats’ poem,</p>
<p>is Alexia.  She’s beautiful and pouty, barely dressed,<br />
“in a relationship,” it says in Italian, but who<br />
“ha insoddisfatti desideri.”  She has “unsatisfied desires,”</p>
<p>in other words.  “Aiutala!,” it implores.  Help her!  Too much, yes,<br />
but interesting:  Keats, a nightingale, unsatisfied desires,<br />
the longing for perfection, and Alexia.  Here she is again,</p>
<p>this time alongside “To Autumn,” a poem I prefer,<br />
although now I’m puzzled by both her abundance<br />
and her ubiquity, since she’s next to the Grecian urn</p>
<p>and Melancholy too.  She’s not by the “Ode to Psyche,”<br />
which is strange, since the first words of that one are<br />
“O Goddess!,” and clearly that’s what Alexia’s meant to appear</p>
<p>to anyone who comes upon her here. (She’s 34, it says,<br />
almost a decade older than Keats ever was.)<br />
For some reason Bartleby prefers not to offer “Indolence” at all;</p>
<p>it’s nowhere on the site, though Keats himself described its subject<br />
as “the only happiness . . . the body overpowering the Mind,”<br />
something Alexia could be said to personify: a bold lover</p>
<p>one can never kiss.  As for the figures on the urn, it’s true,<br />
they will live in supple youth and mad pursuit<br />
as long as does the urn, and their desires will</p>
<p>in all that time go unsatisfied:  boughs that cannot shed<br />
their leaves, the piper who unwearied pipes new songs forever,<br />
the figures forever warm and still to be enjoyed, forever</p>
<p>panting, forever young.  Some believe Keats died a virgin.<br />
Others think his most worldly friend, Brown,<br />
surely took him to a brothel once.  Meanwhile, here in the dark</p>
<p>Italian morning, I left the woman I love in bed a floor below<br />
in order to investigate a bird whose song I never heard<br />
except in words.  I made my way to where, thousands of miles</p>
<p>from home and all my books, I could examine<br />
how such a thing might matter to me.  And when I sought<br />
Keats’ poems electronically, there was Alexia,</p>
<p>and since then I have thought more of her than of Keats,<br />
or my beloved, or the nightingale still singing outside.<br />
Even leaned dangerously far out the studio window,</p>
<p>I can’t see it.  And back on the computer screen, Alexia—<br />
despite the almost two-centuries-old, deathless lines<br />
to her right—insists that it is she who should have my attention,</p>
<p>even as the nightingale sings on.  Of love,<br />
Keats said, “It is my religion.  I could die for it.”<br />
He also said, “I would sooner fail than not be among</p>
<p>the greatest,” and then he died, believing himself a failure.<br />
If I abandon this task soon and return to our room,<br />
I’ll find my lover in bed, sleep-warm and soft.  But still,</p>
<p>there remains something I have not said and believed I could.<br />
I thought it had to do with poetry, but it seems I was wrong.<br />
Keats’ desire was to make something beautiful and true,</p>
<p>and also the satisfaction not only of knowing he’d done so,<br />
but that the world would know it and acknowledge it too,<br />
and that acknowledgment came too late to do him any good.</p>
<p>One more, and among the least, in the endless human plague<br />
of unsatisfied desires.  And what I might have said, or might yet,<br />
has nothing to do with the viewless wings of Poesy,</p>
<p>and more to do with the way the dull brain perplexes and retards<br />
the body’s progress toward love.  Imagine writing the line,<br />
“More happy love! more happy, happy love!”  What does it mean</p>
<p>that I can’t?   Her lack of satisfaction makes Alexia look miserable<br />
in an ever-so-ravishable way, but if I clicked on “Aiutala,”<br />
I would be no closer to her than I am to Keats.</p>
<p>Therefore, the villa’s twenty-four stone stairs<br />
back down to the second floor fly by as swift as in a dream,<br />
and back in my bed and my lover’s arms again,</p>
<p>it is my mind that reawakens and overpowers, for a while at least,<br />
my body, and I speak:  nothing of Alexia, Keats, the nightingale, or the odes;<br />
nothing of how tender the night has been, or the least sickness for home;</p>
<p>only remembrance, softly:  that she recall the night of the day<br />
she took my picture as I knelt by the grave of a Young English Poet.<br />
Weary from hours walking the ancient streets of Rome,</p>
<p>we lay on a roof-top terrace no more than a hundred yards<br />
from the room he died in.  In the distance, St. Peter’s dome<br />
glowed silver-blue.  Remember?  We were there all night,</p>
<p>and all night, gulls from the Tiber passed overhead, squawking.<br />
No one would ever describe their calls as soulful or melodious,<br />
but that night, I say, they were beautiful, and she is satisfied.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNoSpacing"> One lies on one’s back in the woods, savoring the sun,<br />
and for some reason one has opted<br />
for what Fowler calls the “false first person pronoun”—one,<br />
that is, over the other.  One brushes an ant from one’s ear.<br />
One peers up into the breeze-swayed branches<br />
of a Ponderosa pine, one among many<br />
one has arranged oneself under.  Perhaps the wind,<br />
which is easy and warm, dislodged the ant<br />
one swept from one’s ear, meaning<br />
it had fallen many times its height to land there,<br />
in the whorl of the ear of one.  In truth, one wishes<br />
for the tongue of a sylph instead of an ant.  Even two sylphs,<br />
one thinks, though perhaps it is not sylphs one means—<br />
they being invisible spirits of the air—<br />
but rather the slender girls of one’s conjuring.  (One conjures,<br />
one admits.)  Thinking one dead, a deer approaches.<br />
One imagines being a deer, but then one rises<br />
to a seated position, so that the deer will startle<br />
and run.  If only one could run as a deer does.<br />
If one were not so weary, one would that very deer chase<br />
a ways, beguiled by the wave of its white tail.<br />
But no, one is molten.  One seems to have no bones.<br />
One shall not run, not now, nor even rise.<br />
Instead one shall subside to one’s supine pose<br />
and by the sun through the needles of the trees be dappled.<br />
Though of course one should avoid the word dappled.<br />
One knows this.  Yet something about the sun<br />
and the sway of the shadows makes one<br />
larcenous as well as slothful.  And as one acknowledges<br />
one’s Hopkinsian trespass, one notes<br />
perhaps the same sort of finch spoken of<br />
in his poem and sees one’s borrowing as praise.<br />
Of the finch, that is, although it dawns on one<br />
that this particular finch is an American Goldfinch,<br />
and one decides one’s praise is for him instead, the poet.<br />
One feels literary and allusive then.  It seems one’s time<br />
upon one’s back in the woods is not wasted after all.<br />
There is the <em>squeegee-squeegee-squeegee-squeegee</em> song<br />
of the goldfinch.  One is delighted by the nineteen ees<br />
in the preceding line, not one of which has been written,<br />
since one is reclined under the trees<br />
with none of the usual writing implements.  (One counts them<br />
in one’s head and upon one’s fingers instead.)  One’s 1965<br />
Book-of-the-Month Club edition of Fowler’s <em>Modern<br />
English Usage </em>delights one also, though it is a quarter-mile away<br />
and stamped with the name and address of a dead woman<br />
one knew once.  One knew her and she died, and one is glad<br />
to have known her, for she was droll and brilliant,<br />
although one wishes one had known her when she was young.<br />
Once one was young but is no longer,<br />
though one still conjures as if one were—sylphs, women,<br />
the too-soon dead, the chaste and priestly poets of yore.<br />
Otherwise, one does not imagine one is certain of much.<br />
In fact, one is almost asleep, but then a hawk alights<br />
on the limb directly above, a rabbit in its talons.<br />
One’s breath is held.  One perceives the soul<br />
of the rabbit does not abide.  One dares not move,<br />
even though one’s face and white T-shirt<br />
will soon be dappled with the rabbit’s blood.<br />
One imagines.  One thinks of the one one loves<br />
and knows that she will startle<br />
to see one’s bloody face and shirt.<br />
One will stand seemingly wounded and speak to her<br />
of wind and sun, the hawk and its prey, the finch and the deer,<br />
even Fowler (all things whose beauty is past change),<br />
and the one one loves will not understand at first,<br />
when one insists that one must never be<br />
the last one<br />
to die.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> I am a woman; I am a mountain,<br />
I hover over you, a thumb laid<br />
hard across the thickest vein that pulses<br />
fuel down your neck. I’ve locked my knees<br />
beneath oceans, and for nine hours<br />
at a time, I’ve rocked back on your sex,<br />
your hips; I’ve bitten clean through your lip,<br />
and chained you to this chalky wall as skull<br />
and a prick, but you keep on fashioning<br />
this cell for yourself: roof and rib, roof<br />
and rib. And while I clutch your neck<br />
between my tall black boots, blindfolded<br />
and dumbfounded, you’ve the nerve to shine<br />
a lamp in my face and call me <em>mine</em>.<br />
But I’m that peak that does beguile, full<br />
of a darkness that begets your fire<br />
And deep in my womb, where you do sin,<br />
I moan as that little canary<br />
sings. I tell you now I will let blood<br />
flow like water and thicken as mud,<br />
carrying your body off without<br />
guilt, deep in the hole in me you have<br />
built&#8211;filling the fissure, fossilized<br />
in lode, petrified, crushed to coal.</p>

<p>If I’m not a bear, thought the bear&#8211;<br />
and wistfulness rose in him, <em>maybe<br />
he was a falcon, a redwood, a slug,<br />
a raccoon</em>&#8211;but then his bear brain<br />
made him look down at his chest and belly,<br />
and what he saw&#8211;his furry paunch,<br />
the queer white of his skin, a tick<br />
so full of bear blood it would soon<br />
drop off&#8211;was like a boulder blocking<br />
the path of his thinking.<span>  </span><em>A soft<br />
little spring breeze, he thought, why<br />
couldn’t I be the high meadow full<br />
of quarrelsome bobolinks who nip<br />
the little yellow moths from the air<br />
when they’re hungry?<span>  </span>Why couldn’t I…?</em><br />
but suddenly such mental bearfoolery<br />
sickened him into standing humanlike<br />
to bam his ribcage with his front legs,<br />
and to angrily stomp (though he hated<br />
when he split infinitives) Lady Fern,<br />
Guelder Rose, and Carpet Moss until<br />
he’d dampened his lower paws with black-<br />
green juice, conjured a rich forest dirt<br />
and vegetable stink to waft upward.<span>  </span>Oh,<br />
that was when the bear got it straight,<br />
not just the news of his irrevocable<br />
bearness and the piss-ant misery<br />
of a bear’s lot but also on the other<br />
hand the luck of his snout, his tongue,<br />
his penis and balls, his improbable speed,<br />
his forever hidden-from-himself asshole,<br />
his being no other creature or thing<br />
than the bear that he was, an aging<br />
and otherwise unremarkable eastern<br />
black bear.<span>  </span>He was never to be a brown<br />
trout married to icy water and speckled<br />
slithering among stones, nor could he be<br />
the red-tailed hawk whose killing ways<br />
were, to the bear in his picture of it<br />
right then&#8211;death falling from the sky&#8211;<br />
so merciless, clean, and righteous.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>And I return to the bear, claw marks<br />
and scratches on the tree, was it oak or pine,</p>
<p>where the tinker chained his pet<br />
while he went from house to house</p>
<p>hawking knifes and patching pans.<br />
A story told to my father by his grandmother</p>
<p>as they planted seeds in a small bucket,<br />
in forty years a fruit tree big enough</p>
<p>to fill a barrel, the story of the bear<br />
growing in my mind.</p>
<p>There was a whorehouse<br />
turned hotel that burned down.</p>
<p>The willowy son of the town madame<br />
taught me how to waltz there.</p>
<p>The bear long gone, its manacles<br />
melted down</p>
<p>for horseshoes.  You’re right,<br />
I write about white people</p>
<p>as if I wasn’t one of them.<br />
And the orange tree my father planted,</p>
<p>the stories he was told that I was told<br />
to take down—why should anyone care?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not “is survived by,” that gravely passive voice<br />
to deactivate the dead, but “He leaves his wife<br />
of fifty years, Constance,” as if the journey<br />
were his to determine, and compared with this life<br />
the more important thing. There is no choice,<br />
but there may be a setting forth, a way with key<br />
in hand to unlock some admittedly unknown<br />
door or portal. In other words, maybe he’s busy,<br />
careless of the cherished days left behind (below?)<br />
and in such a departure neither bed-ridden nor dizzy<br />
nor undignified, he leaves a little of his leaving<br />
so that it’s hers, too, making the event hardly<br />
more than errand, if indeed his faculties were sturdy:<br />
“leaves,” she almost believes, will carry off her grieving.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -1in;"> “all are mere productions of the brain”<br />
<span>    </span>J. Swift, “On Dreams”</p>
<p>Midnight in the deanery, gangrenous flies,<br />
his mind having moved from honey pot<br />
to excrement, as when God invades the ear.<br />
Vertiginous, silver, trees of the past are weeping<br />
into the canal.<span>  </span>Eels, slim as women’s ankles,<br />
signal beneath the pond’s glass.<br />
Fleet clouds suddenly, Presto!<br />
In the Sluttery mirror, memory’s weeds,<br />
his Ladies – Skinnibonia, Pooh, Skinage, Governor Huff,<br />
brats, rakes, all! &amp; esp. those known “on horseback.”<br />
Something like Regret:<span>  </span>the small married one, cowering<br />
at the locked drawer whom he swiped &amp; pinched,<br />
forced by mouth with rum before turning gravely away to prayer,<br />
the Chancery finding him finally unsound of Mind &amp; Memory,<br />
altered for the worse.<span>  </span>Sinuous eels of the trousers of Ireland,<br />
pink, freckled flesh, fetid swamp of jock, pubis,<br />
clenching menstrual flowers &amp; vaginal sponges,<br />
sheep’s-gut johnnies tied to the flagging horn with red ribbons.<br />
Never much one for that, now Self in fugue:<br />
<em>I hardly understand one word I write.</em><br />
He’s a ruined mill up-river, greens martyred,<br />
rotting in the shallows – <em>hear me, Stella</em> –<br />
No Romantick, but his scrupulous, pared nails,<br />
clumsy tutor’s hands once fumbled in her tiny doll house.<br />
Giant thoughts, minute spoons, forks, dung beetles, men, swallows<br />
lasso and devour the brain &amp; all its unconsummated vistas<br />
still gloaming behind his feminine, his bent &amp; supple spines.</p>

was in black and white,<br />
or sometimes in the sepia<br />
memory tints things with.</p>
<p>The soundtrack was a Victrola<br />
playing “I’ll Get By.”<br />
The stars were a father<br />
with his important mustache;</p>
<p>a maid in the kitchen shelling peas;<br />
a mother who looked<br />
a lot like me, but beautiful,<br />
who wore serenity like a badge,</p>
<p>who scripted our lives<br />
and never flubbed her lines.<br />
Listen to the staccato music<br />
high heels make as they move</p>
<p>down the polished hallways<br />
of the past.<span>  </span>Absorb<br />
the darkness of coal piled up<br />
outside the house, smudging</p>
<p>what seem like mountains<br />
of snow at the curb.<span>  </span>Today,<br />
speeded up and in color,<br />
my life flashes by in short takes:</p>
<p>a curtain of blue sky behind<br />
the arc of a child on a swing;<br />
the dogwoods dying one by one,<br />
punctuating other losses;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">the seductive rustle of pages<br />
turning.<span>  </span>And as I settle<br />
into my part, the final<br />
credits start to roll.</p>

that wouldn’t have us, whose woods<br />
beyond the cemetery<br />
hide houses made of leaves,<br />
their windows lit low<br />
by peat fires, the slow stink<br />
of heat rising through trees<br />
then sinking into grass, the mounds<br />
that seem to shrug and settle.<br />
And the exiles we are, in overcoats<br />
and heavy shoes, we present<br />
our sticky faces to the tellers<br />
and soda jerks, the lovely girls<br />
cracking gum at the luncheonettes,<br />
and we’re told to leave, simple<br />
as that, told to walk our sorry selves<br />
back to sea, back to sod, back<br />
to wherever we come from which, funny<br />
enough, is a place a lot like<br />
this one, happy once and<br />
lovely and now turned<br />
like the moon to black.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal"> The man has been gone so long,<br />
his own child won’t know him.</p>
<p>She and the woman, they must have<br />
their own stories now, their own songs—</p>
<p>some for hauling wood and water,<br />
others to sweeten the girl’s sleep.</p>
<p>The wilderness is a strange place<br />
to slumber, always the other-worldly</p>
<p>howl of something too close.<br />
The man has been gone so long,</p>
<p>working over the mountain, maybe<br />
his child’s hair will be dark and wild</p>
<p>as feathers, her eyes more yellow,<br />
hawk-eyes always spying birds</p>
<p>in the leaves. When he left, the girl<br />
was moon-faced, her wispy curls</p>
<p>as gold as his long ago. But memory’s<br />
spell is always broken. The man knows</p>
<p>her curls will darken as his did,<br />
like honey left too long in the jar.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoFooter">Many men moving, trying to get something<br />
out of the lake. Bending. Pulling.<br />
From a raft with yellow crime tape<br />
around it. I have to stop dancing<br />
to look. I have to find the binoculars,<br />
and turn off the music to hone in.<br />
The silver offering plate of the lake stops<br />
spinning. What hovers at the hooks’ ends?<br />
Tooth by tooth, scar by scar, what who<br />
will stick to which name? Or won’t?<br />
That on and on of the not germane?<br />
The men kneel. They yank and tug.<br />
What arrives to eradicate the kingdom?<br />
What enters the eye of always?<sub><br />

<span>Here, where I am buffeted,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;barely able to stand,<br />
a kestrel hangs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;impossibly still in the wind.<br />
I envy its otherness,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its look of being somewhere else—</span></p>
<p>far from where I’ve scrabbled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up the slope, unloosening scree<br />
as I climbed, lacking altogether<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the grace of this hawk<br />
becalmed in mid air.  <em>Becalmed</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;despite gusts strong enough<br />
to rend a sail in the firth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that blue hem<br />
at the end of these hills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want down.<br />
Without tripping over moles<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tunneling their runways<br />
under my feet. Sheep, stones, shrew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;half-hidden in the upland grasses—<br />
all of us tilting toward sea level,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exposed as the skylark<br />
and golden plover that veer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the airspace between Scald Law<br />
and the kestrel’s barely quivering wings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a recurring dream<br />
I have of hovering, the calm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call kestrel in this storm.<br />
Waking I know even the bird’s lift<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is short-lived. The hair’s-breadth<br />
between heather and heath,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those seconds before it plunges<br />
headlong into a vole.</p>

<p>The male tweezes a bald millet stalk<br />
off a sahara of graveled paper.</p>
<p>The pert watch movements of his head<br />
ignite a ember on each cheek, buff bright</p>
<p>the beak’s rose hip hue. His elderberry eye<br />
subjects this meter cubed of universe</p>
<p>to further scrutiny. The struggles of<br />
a downy filament attract him.</p>
<p>With these two finds he alights, caresses<br />
the injection-molded branch. But there is</p>
<p>no flaw to catch on, no way to make a start.<br />
A problem he sets aside for the moment,</p>
<p>pinning it down with his foot. In the dusky<br />
corner his mate dangles off brass wires,</p>
<p>mobile as a chandelier earring.<br />
Extending her wing, she makes him</p>
<p>more to find, fussing<br />
a small snow from the hot and pearly hollow.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Making a wall stone by stone<br />
as you used to relish<br />
doing, or stacking stone on stone<br />
in the woods to make a cairn,<br />
is like building a sentence<br />
word by word.  If that’s so,<br />
this poem is a word cairn,<br />
and the wall that shambles about<br />
the woodlot, losing stones<br />
to frost heaves and tree roots,<br />
is a sentence that won’t parse,<br />
however long I tinker with it.<br />
Today I’m wondering<br />
what I can say, having listened<br />
hard, without understanding,<br />
as you explained “a position”<br />
when it’s only clear<br />
that the words you utter don’t<br />
fit the thought<br />
you claim is clear when it’s closeted<br />
in your head, failing when you try it<br />
on your tongue.  Some poets<br />
go after “something not sayable”—<br />
how one might describe color<br />
or the idea of God.  You’re after<br />
simply how to translate<br />
the vivid _____ that stutters across<br />
your brain, right hemisphere to left.<br />
Imagine the. . . <em>frustration</em> is too easy.<br />
Try <em>sacrifice</em>, an unwilling one at that.<br />
“Too great a sacrifice makes<br />
a stone of the heart”—<br />
you used to quote Yeats<br />
when anger sent you off into a silent<br />
retreat.  “Come back,”<br />
I’d call across the wall. “Let’s keep trying.”<br />
That was years ago; you don’t remember.<br />
“I like being <em>provisional</em>,”<br />
you do remember saying,<br />
back when your life lay ahead<br />
unbounded, and you were young.<br />
<em>Being provisional</em>, is that my aim now,<br />
out for a walk in the woods<br />
with the dog?  <em>Come here</em>,<br />
I call, <em>come here now, </em>and he won’t,<br />
preoccupied with scents made rich by rain.<br />
Nothing promises us <em>now and forever,</em><br />
only <em>now. </em>And just now,<br />
letting the stubborn dog<br />
and everything else in my life<br />
just be what it is—surely a form of<br />
surrender—I muse<br />
and shift from one outcropping of stone<br />
to the next flank of stone<br />
half-buried in beech leaves,<br />
lifting loose, irregular chunks of smaller stone,<br />
their moss a green-fuse green,<br />
still others unevenly spangled<br />
by pastel ovals of lichen—<br />
stacking the stones.<br />
Raising cairn after cairn,<br />
mute stone after mute stone.<br />
Knowing that each cairn, or any<br />
one stone, may list in place<br />
or tumble, unbalanced<br />
by the least leaf or spit of rain<br />
before I return<br />
to the stones, to lift and coax them,<br />
to turn them—so much is guesswork—and try again.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hayscent fern in one windowpane, rhododendron<br />
in another, red barn siding—</p>
<p>you’re staring out the window, as if what you see<br />
out there might wake</p>
<p>the inner word you want, that fugitive, unfaithful<br />
word wed now to silence.  As we wait,</p>
<p>I try to imagine your brain as a window<br />
fitted with white squares of mist—then frost,</p>
<p>then snow thickening on one pane, on another,<br />
and another . . . .  Slowly</p>
<p>the ferns vanish, scent and root.  For you, each moment<br />
arrives and departs in a swift</p>
<p>migration, like the tanagers that didn’t, this spring, return.<br />
Mist over the memory of tanagers.</p>
<p>And now I blank out the panes that frame two oaks<br />
and a rope hammock. . .</p>
<p>a void where once were form and fragrance,<br />
tall trees and the faint</p>
<p>pattern of braided rope—an impression (now<br />
I remember) a fossil</p>
<p>printed on my firm thighs and onto the smooth<br />
under skin of your arms—after</p>
<p>we’d slept there, barely an hour, suspended in sunlight.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The leaves are turning, one by one carried away in the crisp wind.<br />
In one letter he penned<br />
Coleridge turned away, calling love<br />
a local anguish he meant to leave<br />
behind him.  <em>Away, away</em>,<br />
says the blue and gold day, and no one hears it but the wind, whose law<br />
it echoes.  The dog has a red ball to chase.<br />
You pick a flat, perfect stone for the wall you hope to live long enough<br />
to rebuild.  I prune<br />
briars, pick burrs from the dog’s fur.<br />
I teach <em>come</em> and <em>sit</em>.  <em>Sit here—</em><br />
a longer sit beneath the cedars.  The grass is freshly cut,<br />
sun low, all the energy<br />
of a summer day rushing into bulb and root.<br />
The dog runs off, returns.  The stones balance<br />
steeply.  Good work.  Good dog.  This is<br />
heaven.  Sit.  Stay.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All these greenings and gleanings<br />
in the fields, and her own body moving easily<br />
in and out of the weather. Her parents<br />
still themselves in their glowing home<br />
far away, poised to welcome her.</p>
<p>Sometimes the memory of another house<br />
and the sullen silences that filled it<br />
and the abandoned water tower behind it<br />
where she sneaked away after quarrels<br />
to weep alone, old at thirty.<br />
Now her will sails on, nothing</p>
<p>to impede it, as the men, even the ones<br />
who’ve done the leaving—a lover<br />
damaged by divorce, a lover damaged<br />
by war—shrink far behind.<br />
Even the two horses seem to<br />
linger in their long prime,</p>
<p>the bellied sling of these middle years.<br />
The rhythms of the fields.<br />
Her solid little house.<br />
Some evenings a run in the fading light.<br />
Or dancing, then driving home alone<br />
and happy, sweat drying under the sequins.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mind walks through the house turning off<br />
every lamp but one, leaving<br />
a trail of small relinquishments—</p>
<p>a book turned face-down<br />
at the spot where sleepiness overtook<br />
the little cogs and wheels,</p>
<p>a cup of tea tasted and then forgotten.<br />
What has not been accomplished<br />
lingers as restlessness that braids</p>
<p>itself into Mind’s imperfect<br />
sleep, the cogs and wheels of dreams<br />
and now the house and all the other houses</p>
<p>strung along the seams of the valley are left<br />
to themselves. The words spoken inside them<br />
all day, the air displaced from objects</p>
<p>lifted and set down, and the scents of onion<br />
or lemon oil settle into paper, into cloth,<br />
between grains of polished wood. Each house</p>
<p>breathes on its own now, the sound of<br />
water staying warm in its tank.</p>
<p>The mountain melts into the night, veiled<br />
and uninhabited. An altar. A silence.<br />
The houses melt into the mountain</p>
<p>in that most private hour just before<br />
dawn sets every timber and stone, every<br />
roof, every dish and birdcall back in place.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>In that most private hour, Mind<br />
heats the coffee and, some mornings,<br />
finds itself reading of other lives</p>
<p>as the sun inches towards plums<br />
in a white bowl. The ceramic glaze<br />
of the cup. They could be stones resting</p>
<p>in a clear stream, bathed as they are<br />
in the silence of another kind of morning<br />
absorbed and given purpose:</p>
<p>stones to be shaped and fitted for<br />
the cathedral, bone needles<br />
pulled along seams of rough cloth</p>
<p>as the nuns’ way of listening to their God<br />
and bread broken and passed around,<br />
breaking a fast that once sharpened, as it</p>
<p>sharpens still, the colors and contours<br />
of faith, and savored as though nothing,<br />
at the moment, could be more desired.</p>

the kangaroo joey rides<br />
his first heartbeats. As does the wombat, wrapped</p>
<p>in darkness, and the cuscus, the sugar glider,<br />
flying possum, dasyure. Wise nature,<br />
to stitch onto even the smallest pouched-mouse</p>
<p>a sleeve in which to hide. My grandmother,<br />
mother of eleven with little to claim<br />
her own, loved pockets so deeply</p>
<p>she fastened them to every apron,<br />
and no hands but hers ever ventured inside.<br />
Pockets! What would we be without you.</p>
<p>Where would the diner waitress tuck<br />
her filled bills, extra straws, the gnawed pencil<br />
adding it all up. And in the ancient</p>
<p>land that was my childhood<br />
and maybe yours, where else to secure<br />
the tackle and trim of the nerds and geeks—</p>
<p>protractors, slide rules, pens and more pens<br />
leaking out answers I was not yet<br />
ready to hear, above the racking clack</p>
<p>of my uncles’ billiards, the break<br />
and spread then the padded gulp of the pocket<br />
taking it all in. Another child,</p>
<p>my husband’s mother, lined her pockets<br />
with stones on her way to school<br />
so her birdlike bones would register sufficiently</p>
<p>on the Great Depression’s official scales.<br />
<em>Pocket</em>: keeper of secrets,<br />
hidden lining. Something to empty</p>
<p>at day’s end. Encoder, ender<br />
of marriages. Someone discovers a phone number,<br />
receipt, a lipstick-smudged handkerchief,</p>
<p>the human stain. <em>Hide</em>: skin<br />
of an animal, tacked to a wall. <em>Go ahead,<br />
spill it out</em>, nods the man with the diploma</p>
<p>nailed above his desk, proferring<br />
a tissue for your tears. Don’t take it,<br />
why should you, why surrender the clenched purse</p>
<p>of your history: the nights you’ve hoarded,<br />
your unspoken prayers, the liturgy<br />
of keys riding the blue-jeaned pocket of a lover,</p>
<p>wearing down year by year<br />
a pocket-sized bald spot on his thigh<br />
for your eyes only, here beside the nightstand</p>
<p>where he spills his keys, matches, wadded<br />
bills, loose change. All day you will wear his scent<br />
in your hair, your closed lips sealing</p>
<p>the contract. Even the smallest nation requires<br />
pockets of resistance, hidden heartbeat,<br />
muted drum. If you never hide,</p>
<p>who will come seeking? Beneath the earth,<br />
in hollows too deep to mine,<br />
alluvial gold. Untapped vein, secret ore.</p>
