								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"> This prized fish on the wall in our suburban split-level is a rainbow trout, an identification I know because my husband made a point of telling me this, more than once, when he brought the fish home from the lake. When I forget what type of fish it is, the engraved brass plaque beneath the rainbow trout is there to remind me. There is no rainbow on this trout, though; just one long rosy band down the side that flares like a blush on the gills. Also, the fish’s skin is dotted with black speckles. So “rainbow” is not necessarily a given, not something I would naturally intuit about this fish. I admit I only know one side, the fish’s left side, but wouldn’t one safely assume its other side is more of the same? Sometimes I wonder though. This fish appears to have been pinned mid-leap to the wood behind it, as if it leapt up and got stuck there right in our dry house. The long curve of its body looks pliable and at the same time frozen stiff. The fish is empty. That silent open mouth with the underbite concerns me; it makes the fish appear at an utter loss to explain its circumstances. Its left eye stares at me when I use the chamois to clean the cobwebs from its gaping mouth. I’m most careful when I wipe the artificial tongue.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">A real trout’s tongue is quite long and barbed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Mounted just above the fish’s head is the jig, in other words, the hook and lure the fish swallowed. This jig resembles a flashy skirt that hides the hook. When this fish swallowed the hook, the hook lodged deep in the back of its tongue and stayed there. Even if it had not grown to an unfortunate trophy size, this fish was a goner. My husband refused to cut the line to release the fish; he wasn’t about to lose that lure. Now the lure is mounted right there alongside the fish’s mouth, just out of its reach.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I don’t fish with my husband. I can’t stand how the fish look once they’ve been landed, the way their mouths open and close, open and close, with no sound.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">My husband likes to tell the story of how he caught this fish. “True story,” he always begins. I’ve heard it so often I sometimes misremember; I get confused and become convinced that I was the one out on the clear lake that day with my rod and reel, that I was the one who saw this amazing thing leap straight out of the water into blue sky, saw it flash and twist high in the sun, that I was the one who felt the splash on my cheek when it dropped deep back into the cold lake. And I am the one who feels a suffocating sadness when I recall how strong this fish was while it fought.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">To land such a fish as this is rare. When you fish for trout you must make that jig dance just so.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The fish is mounted over our bed. For a trout, this fish is enormous. When I look at it long enough, yes, I can see that it’s beautiful; but also that it’s monstrous. Its length is nearly as wide as our bed. My husband says it weighed over 39 pounds. Not anymore. This fish has been hollowed out. My husband paid a fortune to have it done. Its stripped skin has been expertly dried and stretched over a frame that restores it to its fish-like shape. Its gleaming scales are polished and sealed. At night, before my husband turns out the light, I stare up at its pale silver belly. When we make love, I close my eyes and dream of leaping into fresh water.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"> <strong>&#8220;The Pointer&#8221; received the 2nd annual Bevel Summers Prize for the Short Short Story.</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>Swallows fly in and out the broken windows of a V-12 silvered by weather, our great-grandfather’s ancient Sunday cruising sedan. We’re sitting on the hoods of the used-up cars that rust now on the first farm he ever owned, waiting for shooting hours to begin. We talk about our city jobs and toss a baseball back and forth. A profusely ticked young pointer, intelligent-eyed, with shivering legs, tilts her nose toward the sky as a gust of wind clears the ragged woods. Pinned against the logo on the side of a derelict tractor is a sunflower, brittle and spiked; the neighbor’s little combine did not catch it. Our watches say it’s time or we would dally there all day in the automobile graveyard.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>Out in the field we see the young pointer, John’s dog, quarter like an Elhew and shake the cover to pieces. Seeing her courage so young, we want to be bird dogs ourselves. John whistles her in and makes a show of apologizing that there are so few birds to find. The spring was wet and cold when it shouldn’t have been; young quail died of exposure by the thousands. Thousands more did not make it through the summer-long drought. We walk the cover anyway and carry our side-by-sides at port-arms as if we might have a chance to use them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">John keeps the pointer at heel until we’re within sight of the overgrown feedlot. Two hundred calves used to bawl here during each fall’s weaning. The original owner of the farm had built for his family an improbable four-story house. In the grass we see the stone foundation with nothing above it, the root cellar open to the skies, the splayed piles of weathered boards. We shift our path and walk around.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>In the feedlot the dog ghosts through foxtail spikes. The bell attached to her collar chimes. When there is no sound, we fight through the cover and see her standing so still it seems she cannot move. The bird is not the bobwhite we had been hoping for. The bird is a wren. We watch its swerving flight and crack our guns.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>At the family plot there are the matched headstones and what seems like too much space on every side. We walk the savage grass, the pointer leading us toward a wild plum thicket as bluebirds scatter. The headstones are turning green. Each year it is harder to read what they say. The family cemetery never took; our ancestor and his second wife alone honored the idea. We have killed birds near the graves before. We have stopped to talk about how this outsider did so much of the work of getting somewhere that we don’t have to. All of our own work, we have said, is just a kind of playing around.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>He should have died one winter; the polio was the worst sign yet of his father’s vexed luck in the new world. The virus damaged his leg for good. While his brothers and sisters helped labor to right the farm, he took piano lessons and was spoiled by his mother and aunts. No one went to college but him; only he needed to make a living in town. He studied military history, learned the Civil War to no end, went on to become a music teacher. He wore suits and won cash with his sunny tenor though his brothers never learned to read. Eventually, he made a killing dealing cars.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>Cow-and-calf operators sold out to him and he built his land empire. Some of the ruined men he kept on as hired hands or sharecroppers. They drove his cast-off cars and trucks to death to do his work for him, left them out in the open to save the cost of hauling them away.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>After he turned to business, our ancestor would do anything, it was said, to get another dollar. Crafty Irish bastard: the worst chiseler around. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>Wandering the last piece of land we have to know him by, we have shrugged our shoulders. Every family commits a shameful act. If it does not, a run of bad luck could set it back forever.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The next day we clamber on the cars in early afternoon. Our boots dangle near wheel wells; the backs of our knees graze bumpers. The last two hours we marched through hedgerow jungles without a break. The universe of clover across the wet-weather creek was also empty. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>A tractor starts up by the neighbor’s new barn; the engine catches and begins to rumble. A cropduster makes another pass above the neighbor’s winter wheat. John taps the hood of the V-12 and the pointer jumps up. In a moment she is on the roof. Facing forward, the beautiful dog we all admire ornaments the old sedan.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>After dark we take the ferry across the James and find our table at Taylor’s in town. Another empty place, another way of telling us the birds aren’t here. A game is on TV: seven-man football, the Triple A Championship carried live. The air stinks from a solitary cigar angled toward the ceiling by an aged farmer’s stumped fingers. He drinks by himself at the bar. Almost without noticing, we decide the matter: we’ll make a deal with the neighbor. By Christmas it will be done.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>Past midnight we spill out the door. The silent streets of the town rebuke us. We wander across railroad tracks and stand dumbstruck before a wire cage stuffed to a height of twenty feet with salvaged aluminum cans. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>In the daytime at the farm, the light was all over us. We could have been an army at rest, young men in camp at Shiloh after taking a dip in Owl Creek. Ten miles distant, the farm is quiet. The burying ground for old cars reveals three rows of still forms. Near the woods edge, the ancient V-12 sinks lower and pushes itself hard against the earth like a soldier drying himself in the sun. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>wetatuhneesáhUt.  I am holding onto the gut.</p>
<p>Wah.  Once they were accepted they were allowed inside—White men.  D. D. Mitchell, Indian Agent, among them.  They sent a boy.  The Arikara men.  Bear Medicine Men, their society.  They sent him.  Words, he gave them.  Their eyes showed the white of trust, them not having it.  They did not.  Belief—they could not open themselves to it.  They followed the boy, his words out in front.  Walking, they were behind them.</p>
<p>&#8220;A band of bears.  They are preparing now to demonstrate their power.  If you would like.  You may come and witness.&#8221;</p>
<p>The men, D. D. Mitchell, being one, were fat with the pleasure of the bears&#8217; invitation.  Stories.  They had heard them.  They knew.  Arikara men were known.  Bear Medicine Men Society was famous.  Six bears.  They looked like men wearing skins to the men whose eyes showed the white.  They looked like bears.  They were.  Sahnish.  Sitting.  The bears in the center of the lodge.  The people standing like grass around them.</p>
<p>This is the world.</p>
<p>We live in.</p>
<p>Everyone has their view.  A place for it was provided.  The small up close.  The large in the back.  Sitting or standing.  The men, D. D. Mitchell was one, were let so close they could easily tell.  Deception.  For it, they were looking.  Their faces, with the eyes that showed white reflected their mind.  Doubting D. D. Mitchell.  His thoughts, he recorded.  He was a white man, keeping a journal:  <em>I thought them so grotesquely made up I could not decide if they were ludicrous or frightful.  I was uncertain which response was the best:  laughter or terror.</em></p>
<p>Time lingers in the great Earth Lodge.  In this world we are living.  A young boy, again, he was called.  Clay.  It was needed.  The earth is particular.  Power has a place, so specific, instructions were detailed.  Where.  The boy, he was to go, a designated spot for digging.</p>
<p>It was soon.  His return from the river bed.  The clay, it was, given shape.  Each piece in the palm of a bear:  buffaloes, men, horses, bows and arrows.  Each clay man set on a mount, armed.  Each mount placed three feet in front.  The line of buffalo they were standing.</p>
<p>The man, his eyes still showing their white thought.  These were thoughts, he was thinking.  <em>Ludicrous solemnity.</em>  <em>They are performing.  Ridiculous.</em>  His thoughts, he wrote them, explaining how they were changing the arrangement.  Each one was placed, then the Bears addressed them, the hunters.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Children, mine.  I know the time between hunts has been long.  You are hungry.  I know.  Now.  Use strength.  Wah.  Kill as many as you can.  There are people here who are laughing if you do not kill.  They will, laugh.  Go now.  They  have already smelt you.  The buffalo, they have started.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The men with Mitchell were entirely amazed as the clay figures took off with the last breath of word.  The Bear&#8217;s mouth, he was speaking.  Straw arrows shot from clay bows pierced the buffalo three feet away.  The great animals began their falling.  Dead; they were falling.  All but two who completed the circle&#8217;s outermost edge with arrows sticking out of their sides, one with three, the other with five.  Finally they finished their fall.  Dead in the center.</p>
<p>At this he spoke, the same Bear Medicine Man, &#8220;Run.  Into the fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>One, it was lit.  Without fear they ran full toward the flame.  The horses pulled to a stop at the edge.  They were standing.  A clay rider called out—the leader— his anger clear,  &#8220;Why are you not going?&#8221;</p>
<p>The others of clay whipped their mounts.  The horses finally agreeing.  The flames took them at once—the mounts and their clay riders.  Tumbling into the flame.  The center taking them in, in a tumbling down they lay to bake.</p>
<p>The Bear Medicine Men gathered the slain buffalo and placed them on the fire.</p>
<p>Ash.</p>
<p>They were pounded down after baking dry.  The Bear Medicine Men spoke.  The men with the ridiculous eyes understood nothing of what they said.  No Translation.  The dust was brought to the top of the Earth Lodge and given to the wind.  The men with the white eyes still believe they were deceived, despite their senses.  They failed to understand the Bear Medicine Men&#8217;s Power:  the animated clay, the soul, the motion, the life.  Experience, they denied it, explained it away.  Their senses could not contradict what their thinking said was real.  Their breadth of power limited to them, individually, as one.</p>
<p>Man alone is nothing, shouting into the wind.  Believing the time is over, some, they have strange names, pledge allegiance to city limits.  Then it was our turn, the new everlasting feeling.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let me tell you bout my boy, she says, the way they do, the gnarled walnut knuckles working like the gnarled walnut of their cheeks swollen with that pride that slows her speech from the gallop it also wants her to take. But let me tell you, she says behind eyes dream ridden, about my boy, my boy’s boy, she means, her grandson, he’s the grandest thing she’s ever seen. Can play ball all day and not be too tired to watch her roll the biscuit in the shack of a kitchen out behind the shanty they inhabit, the flour powdering the cutting board, the floorboards when she sighs too hard. And he does well enough at school though those books fall apart at the spine and the mouse gnaws the corners where they’re stored back in the schoolhouse over summers, summers when he picks her a long stemmed weed that flowers and brings it to her from beside the road where he walks in the ditch when a car comes, well into the ditch because you never know who’s boiling the dust down that road, could be anybody, but he brings the flower with white petals dust speckled. And the little girls like him because his cocoa skin comes over those cheekbones that must owe something to that Cherokee down the line before they all moved north back in the day, the one with the ebony hair long past his shoulders that they had a tintype of once long ago but it warped and peeled in one fire or another. Noble looking man without a wrinkle round his squinting eyes. Whatever happened to him. But it’s that boy she wants to speak of, her boy’s boy, so lively and quick limbed, a caution with his bright eyes that grin though there’s a tooth missing from where that white grocerman kicked him at the fair. And he grows fine and tall and lone pine straight and when the war brings his turn he signs for the army and he’s in Ohio and New Jersey and then over there in France and Italy and she doesn’t know where all and when he comes home there’s a parade for them, for the black boys who went by the train from their side the tracks, a parade down their unpaved street and they’re all so sharp in those uniforms with the razored line in the pants legs all marching to time despite the dust to the flag whapping in the breeze at the head of the column and he’s got a medal on his pocket but when they try to describe to her what it’s for she has a hard time breathing it in because that world aint her world and never will be and she’s mostly glad and sleepy. So pretty soon he’s got him a girl of course and he’s so good he’s only got the one girl though the way they talk he could have them all, that gone tooth don’t matter to his smile, and then he’s got a boy of his own and that boy plays ball too in the pasture he’s let to play in with the other boys south of Main and that boy too has those same Cherokee cheekbones thank Lord that will mark him out as the envy of girls and not take after his mama who runs around but this boy, this newest one, the littlest one, her great grandson, four generations to account for now before you can fall asleep good, also brings her a flower from side the road, the same white weed that leans into the barbed wire and so gets protected from the mash of cattle and feeds on the lush water from the ditch when it rains and she squints at him there bringing her his flower in a hand palsied like hers only he never does because that boy she wants to tell you about in the beginning, her only grandboy, was never born at all except in the womb of sleep she sobs to wake from because his father, her own first boy that she fetched in her belly through ten moons and yet another winter rich with cold suds and bleached wash, never grew up to sire her any kin because one night while he was twenty during what they called the Red Summer of 1919 when the devils broke with hell after that first war and everone of them was stalking streets for Bolsheviks and work that there wasn’t enough of to go round he was hauled from the jailhouse (where they said he’d raped a white woman which he never did) and strung at the lamppost and burned alive with a chest full of lead over a pile of lumber and if you go back into the stacks of that yellow newspaper you can see his body still for yourself lying in a state of flames, the sphere of the skull fired clean of features, the broiled torso glowing in black and white, the legs or what’s left of them melting into the wreckage of the fire, it’s all there, the posers with hands on hips and grinning cigarettes, gawkers in good hats and even a laughing woman in a belted coat making the background of the night lit by the pyre of her boy’s body, her boy slowly refined into the night of his execution when she can’t sleep and for what.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Somewhere between McCook and the grid of rural routes she had traveled to reach the farm, Letty had applied a coat of lipstick. She liked to drive with the window down, her hand pressed flat against the wind. Now her skin was coated with a fine layer of dust, her red-pink mouth, glazed with grit.</p>
<p>Because her work sometimes required her to interview a male sheriff or mechanic or bartender, Letty wore a fly-fisherman&#8217;s vest over an ankle-length skirt. A hand-sized spiral notebook fit neatly inside one of the pockets. Later, in the air-conditioned drug store down the street from the room she rented at the Moore Motel or, sometimes, there and then on the side of the road, she recorded her observations. The condition of the house. The number of dogs. The demeanor of the children, watching from behind screens.</p>
<p>She didn’t like interviews. She didn’t like that she could make people say things they&#8217;d want to take back. Which they always did.</p>
<p><em> Read it out</em>, a voice would whine into a payphone receiver. Letty would pull the curtain away from the window and stare at the telephone wires strung between the poles across the street.  <em>I may have exaggerated that part about the little girl left for so long in the cellar.  What&#8217;s the harm in reading what you wrote?  </em></p>
<p>Letty&#8217;s skirt swung as she crossed the gravel road that seemed to disappear in a pool of watery light. She felt the brush of the hem against her ankles, the rush of air, high between her legs, and then, as if she’d been hit with a stone, the girl&#8217;s gaze struck.</p>
<p>Her bare feet scuffed at the powdery dust beneath the bottom strand of the barbed wire fence. Her shirtwaist dress was unbuttoned at the collar.  The design was flowers.  Dark-centered, round-petaled flowers. And though the collar was white, and the sleeves were trimmed in white, the front of the dress was smeared with grime, as if she’d been inching her way beneath the front porch or lying face down on the back of a horse.</p>
<p>Behind her stood an empty water trough. Farther back, in the shade of an oak, the house. Letty noted the storm windows of a root cellar in the foundation. The axe in the stump of a tree. A door squeaked open on a rusty hinge. Behind the screen, a woman watched Letty approach the girl with her hand on the fence.</p>
<p>The first time Letty spoke to the girl, she was standing outside the video arcade next door to the Rexall drugstore, where she went after work to transcribe her notes into reports. It was air conditioned. There was a soda fountain.  The counter was usually empty, evenings.</p>
<p>The girl told Letty that her parents were migrant workers, but she lived with a foster mother west of McCook. The social worker who had taken her there said she ran a horse farm, though it hadn’t taken but a day to find out there weren’t any horses any more.</p>
<p>Letty and the girl developed a vague relationship after that. Sometimes the girl missed the bus after school and spent the afternoon in the video arcade, waiting for her foster mother’s brother to finish his shift at the Conoco station at the end of the block. If Letty saw her through the window, she’d wave. The girl would come out, and they’d go inside the Rexall where Letty would buy her a Coke.</p>
<p>The girl sat across from her in the booth, sipping from two straws.  Sometimes they exchanged a few words. Mostly they exchanged looks. In any case, Letty looked at the girl, interpreting what she could from the circles beneath her eyes. The scattering of blemishes across her forehead. The blunt-cut hair that fell unevenly from a zig-zag part to her chin.</p>
<p>Sometimes Letty gave her coins to put in the miniature jukebox soldered to the wall above the table.  The girl turned the frames, reading the titles of the out-dated 45s handwritten on labels glued to the racks. She liked a song called “Ode to Billie Joe.” Letty watched her scratching the wax paper cup of melting ice with a dirty fingernail, mouthing the words<em>,</em> and handed her a business card embossed with her name and title. Field Agent. Child Protective Services. McCook, Nebraska. The girl’s thumb grazed the raised letters.</p>
<p>“Give it back a minute.” Letty printed a phone number on the back. “This is where I stay. This is where you can find me.”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t matter. She don’t let me use the telephone.”</p>
<p>The woman at the top of the stairs wore a checked apron tied at the waist, and, beneath the apron, a tea-length dress, also checked, but a different print from the apron. Landowner. Letty saw it in the fit of her dress. In the way her bare legs in the low-heeled pumps that were wrong for the landscape possessed the floor.</p>
<p>The girl flinched when the screen door slammed. The woman called out from the top of the stairs, and then she was walking toward the fence.</p>
<p>Letty reached for the notebook inside her vest pocket and drew the pen out from under the rubber band that held it closed. She pulled the cap off with her teeth, and, in a scrawl she hoped the girl could read, scribbled the telephone number on a page she ripped from the binder.</p>
<p>The girl held Letty’s eyes for a second before she let go of the fence and ran toward the house.</p>
<p>The woman caught the girl by the wrist, unfolded her fingers, and crushed Letty’s number in the palm of her hand.</p>
<p>Half skipping, half running, the girl followed, led like a goat on a rope. Just before they reached the stairs, she peered over her shoulder and raised her hand behind her back. A furtive farewell, Letty thought. Then her teeth broke into a smile, and the business card wagged between her fingers like a tail.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/05/Hollmeyer_IceRiver5.mp3">Hollmeyer_IceRiverHistoryMuseum</a></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;"> Dot hobbled along with her walker, making apologies for moving slow since her fall. The docent asked what happened, and she explained about the dark cat in the dark hallway. Then she pointed at his ankle and asked <em>him </em>what happened. He adjusted his pants leg so it covered the monitoring device. A dark man in a dark alley, he said.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The docent paused at the first room and held out his hand. This is what a nun’s room looked like. Here’s where she kept her vows. Here’s her bed, her bible, the sink where she splashed water on her face.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Dot and her daughter Mary stood in the doorway, feeling the thickness of the barrier rope against their shins.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">And here’s what their chapel looked like. Here’s a pew, a kneeler, an altar.<span>  </span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">This here is the religious artifacts room. The docent gestured to a headless mannequin modeling a faded habit. A forest of crucifixes grew around her.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">And the last room is the biggest one. The collected curios of Ice River’s residents. There was no rope here, so Dot and Mary stepped inside and followed the docent toward the doll collection.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">These are some of the finest porcelain dolls in the world, the docent said.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I used to have one just like that, Dot said, pointing to the one with chipped lips.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">They wandered among bookshelves stacked high with old photo albums, paperweight fetishes and a small herd of taxidermy — pheasants, mostly. There was Celia Smith’s candlestick collection, still dripped full of wax, and Thelma Logan’s wigs on plastic heads. She was the mayor’s mistress in the fifties, the docent said.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Yes, I knew her, Dot said. She lumbered ahead with her walker, past the record collections and on to the display of Patty Singleton’s crystal Christmas ornaments. I knew her, too, Dot said. She was a real bitch.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Mary didn’t think her mother was capable of saying that word — especially in a holy place, or a place that used to be holy.</p>
<p style="line-height: normal;">            Dot moved on, pushing past the docent. Here they are, she said, stopping mid-stride so that Mary nearly ran up on her heels. My elephants. A typed card taped to the shelf explained that there were a hundred and seventy-eight of them, made of ivory and wood and stone and brass and jewels.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“These are <em>yours?</em>” Mary asked.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Well, my goodness,” the docent said. “Thank you for your generosity.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“You never asked if I wanted any of these,” Mary said.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Because you don’t,” Dot said. “They only have meaning for me. When I worked at the embassy, I had friends from India and Africa and all over Asia, and they sent them for me to remember them by. But they’re all dead now.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I don’t think our donors have ever come in here. They’re usually dead, too,” the docent said. “We should interview you for the newsletter about the work you did.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Interview my daughter,” Dot said. “See if she can even tell you.”<span>  </span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I wouldn’t know what to say,” Mary said. “I’m still trying to figure out why you gave all these to a stranger instead of your only daughter.” She was staring at the leg where the docent wore his monitor.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Dot pulled a small white elephant from the back of a shelf. “Here. This one is for you.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Mary turned the misshapen lump in her hand. “Great. Thanks.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“See, you don’t know the value of anything. That piece is pure ivory. It’s three thousand years old.” Dot turned to the docent. “Bet you didn’t know that, did you?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">He turned red, as though he’d been caught stealing.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Mary looked the elephant in its dull eye and tried to imagine what it had seen in its long life that started before there was a difference between things that are holy and things that are not. But she couldn’t see that far, couldn’t see beyond this day, this walker plodding ahead of her, this handbag into which she dropped the elephant among the things that matter.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href='http://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/05/Althousefinal.mp3'>Althouse: Goran Holds His Breath</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The birds on the water have not heard him yet. Once they do they will burst upwards in flight and he will press the trigger. A gaggle of nine geese, necks huddled, drifts near the opposite bank. For a second the old farmer smells stuffed-goose, roasted on a spit. He kneads feathers on his fingers from cleaning past kills. The illusions—a warm fire, the taste of hot wine, the shelter of his chair after a good meal—are seductive. But he will not aim at the birds.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">At home he has the spit ready behind the kitchen, the fire set. His wife, Ingrid, assembled all the materials for a fruit and chestnut stuffing—twelve ounces of pitted prunes, an orange, six apples and a dozen chestnuts. She left these foods out on the kitchen counter as they agreed—for proof it was an accident when the police question him.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Goran Pettersson points the rifle away from the geese and looks again into the scope. Across the lake, still as glass, a doe stretches her neck toward the sky. The old farmer sees her ears pivoting, detecting. But he will not aim at the deer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The birds on the water have not heard him yet. The rifle is hard against his shoulder, the smell of metal burns his throat, and a rain of tears drowns his jaw. Goran does not want to enter his next minute. So he holds his breath.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Ingrid stands several yards ahead of him on the brown grassy slope of the hill where the birds will fly when they launch. She leans against her walking stick. She is as motionless as the doe, but is looking away toward the horizon where the sun begins to light. Goran turns the rifle toward her. In the scope he sees the long braid of her gray hair magnified, like a woven afghan—shades of silver, gray, ash blonde, white. He feels its familiar windings slide across his hand, from the thousand times he’s pulled her toward him.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">She is ten years older and from the beginning he always did what she said. Some called her bossy, but he never minded her ways. He knew he was prone to temper, easy to rile if things weren’t as expected, impatient around children. It was her decision not to have any. When they were younger and her father eventually died from the plaques and tangles in his brain, they began talking of their own deaths—in theory. One afternoon on a picnic, after wild loving on that same grassy hill—in the hour afterwards when he was always so grateful and would say yes to anything she asked—he had agreed to save her the agony of a long dying.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Now she stands there, watching the sun rise, trusting him completely.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The weight of the promise he made cuts into his spine. When the gun fires he fears his body will split, like a tree fractured in its fall.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Finally, he has to breathe. His exhale rustles the long grass where he stands.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The birds on the water blast off.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">But he lowers the rifle.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">When he does not fire, Ingrid turns, braces against her stick, and looks at Goran. After a while she shuffles down the hill toward him. He is afraid of her stare as she advances, that he has failed her, failed in his promise. He feels sweat run down his side, making his chambray shirt damp under his coat. His knees turn pliant and his lungs ache with the shame that has settled on him.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">But she walks past. Her eyes gaze blank, two holes in her face. She has forgotten why they came.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">He does not know what to do so he goes about his day. He mends the fence by the garden, sweeps the chicken pen, and picks ripe tomatoes for dinner salad. Sometimes, since he sold his cropland, keeping only his house and the property by the lake, he has to search for things to occupy his time. He does his chores slowly so they will last longer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">From outside he observes Ingrid through the windows. She passes back and forth behind the glass inside each room. He knows she will dust first and then vacuum. Sometimes, forgetting, she will dust again, starting over.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">They roast a chicken for dinner. He makes the stuffing. Afterwards they sit with coffee mugs at the bare kitchen table in their two straight-back chairs while the sun descends, darkening the room about them. Her hand lies still on the table top. He cups his hand over hers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Many mornings pass. Every morning Ingrid asks to walk to the lake.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">This new morning the birds on the water do not hear him yet. The birds on the water might be the same geese, older, or they might be descended from last year’s goslings or they might be new birds, just landed. The deer’s ears pivot in the scope, or it might be a jack rabbit with a twitching nose, or it might be a bob cat, still as a stone, anticipating prey. The rifle is the same rifle and it is loaded. Goran puts his finger gently on the trigger.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">His wife stands several yards ahead of him on the brown grassy slope of the hill. She is the same wife, but she is not the same wife.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The birds on the water have not heard him yet. He does not want to enter his next minute, or the next, <a name="_GoBack"></a>or the next. So Goran holds his breath.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong> &#8220;Permian Flats&#8221; was runner-up in the 2nd annual Bevel Summers Prize for the Short Story.</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>It had taken them three days to find the Spragg boy. A migrant worker heading to Permian Flats had found the abandoned truck out past Crooked Creek where the road sloped down and away from the pasture of feed grass. An hour or so later the group of searchers found the body lain out beside a great rent in the earth. A deputy later told us at the Blue Hat that down in there was a storm of hot slag flung up beneath the soil. Said that it reeked of bad things. Another man said that he could see the fiery glow from the top of Elk Butte where he had been trailing wolves for the state. A few of the boys finished their beers when they heard this and left their frothy bottles along the bar so they could drive out to find it. I watched them go and finished my own drink. The bar was mostly empty now and the silence sobered me. Although I was also curious I ended up driving over to Enterprise to see Amaya instead. She heated up some cold pork and rice and I ate them in corn tortillas and had another beer as I told her about what the deputy had said. It was a strange thing to talk about. Of otherworldly gashes in the earth and of the way it so easily killed. Of things one could not explain. Amaya crossed herself and put her small hand there on my chest as we sat on the couch together with the lights off and an afghan around us for warmth.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>­–Lo siento por la familia, she told me.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>–Me too, I agreed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span><span> </span>The next morning I took Amaya with me when I drove out with the others. There was a line of pickup trucks and a few sedans with scattergun blasts of mud across the undercarriages parked along the road. In the east two farm hands were rolling out spools of barbed wire at the direction of one of the deputies. They flung steel posts from the four-wheeler as they moved, and it was apparent they were building a barricade between us and that place beyond. Amaya and I stood apart from the others at first and I felt her hand move to my waist. Her fingers fit in at the belt loops her closeness comforted me. The father was a man I knew and whom I thought was decent. He stood out ahead of everyone else and was crouched near the ground. After a while he dug his hands under the grass into the netting of roots to find the clumped loess beneath. He brought it up and examined it before letting it sift away between his fingers. Trying to excavate some kind of reasoning for what had befallen his boy, I figured. A woman was smoking beside us but no one really spoke. Finally someone came up from the road and passed back a bottle of rye whisky. It made its way around and I took my share before giving it to Amaya. She swallowed a bit and I could smell the sweetness of it on her mouth. A stray heeler circled noiselessly. Its canine slouch looking like a patch of dirty snow in the late-summer grass. One of the men gave a low whistle to bid it return. The sound of it ended up seeming dramatic and loud.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Back at the road we waited to offer our condolences to the father but I grew uneasy with what to say and ended up leading Amaya back to my truck. She sat there in the middle of the bench seat and I saw that she was crying quietly. I kissed her hand and told her to wait and went up the road and spoke with Burgess and Stokes who were unloading another spool of wire from the farm truck. They had seen the place already and told me it had spat and stung of lava and smoke. Other men had come to climb the hills to the north the night before, but Stokes said the sheriff turned them away. Not that it had stopped many of them. There at the edge it had been like the earth had parted to reveal itself, and at first it had been strangely alluring, but then it reminded the men of what hell must look like. Burgess spat to the ground with his boot and said that that now he wished he had not seen it at all.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>At the bridge where Crooked Creek bent and then widened I brought the truck to a stop beneath a windbreak of cottonwood. I wanted to tell Amaya about how I had wanted to move on past the father and up over the berm to see that place. The very thought of this made me feel ashamed however and I remained quiet as she leaned against me. Outside I pushed the strands of barbed wire apart so she could slip through first and we both walked through the morning glory and into the pasture. Up the flank of the long hill we could finally see the bulk of smoke flattened out over the valley. In the fading light the smoky underbelly lay bruised with color as what unseen below seethed.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the ninth summer of the conflict, I was hired as a translator for a foreign officer. My wife was furious. For days, she refused to speak to me other than mumbling <em>That man is the devil</em> even though she’d never met him. I walked behind her as she mumbled. I reminded her our lives were rubble, and in spite of her warnings, I took the job.</p>
<p>I talked my younger brother into a job as our driver. His wife was no happier, but they had a baby on the way. I was relieved to see my brother occupied in legitimate work.</p>
<p>As it turned out, the foreign officer rarely spoke. The skin of his face was constantly peeling. In the open jeep I watched it flutter like torn parchment over his reddened skin. I suggested we stop for water. “No. Keep moving.” He said this to me. I relayed this to my brother. My brother, clearly exhausted and parched, said something back that I didn’t dare translate. The officer didn’t ask.</p>
<p>The foreign officer has a scar like a crescent slicing the back of his skull, as if someone at some time wanted to peer inside. The officer has a metal plate beneath his scalp. Sometimes, the metal gleams through his skin.</p>
<p>On a stretch of dusty road, after turns that took us nowhere, we stopped to ask directions from a shepherd. My brother claimed to know him which surprised me. He got out and walked through the goats and sheep. They talked for a long time. The animals milled about alongside the road, making their animal noises. From the back of the jeep, I watched the officer’s profile. He stared, unblinking through his sunglasses. “What are they saying?” “Nothing.” “They can’t be saying nothing.” I listened more closely. “He’s asking after the man’s father.” “They’re talking too long. Tell him get back in the jeep.” I yelled at my brother to hurry up. My brother told me to fuck off. He and the shepherd kept talking. Now and then they both looked over at the officer. The shepherd turned and pointed in one direction, then another. He leaned in to whisper. They embraced, and my brother palmed him money that the shepherd slipped into a pocket before walking back into the field, followed by the animals. Where my brother got the money, I had no idea. When he finally got back in the jeep, he had no time to open his mouth before the officer fired and blew open his skull. The officer pushed him out onto the dirt. He lay twitching; blood pooled around his head. I screamed and tried climbing out the back seat when the officer moved behind the wheel, put the jeep into gear, and drove us off.</p>
<p>*<br />
Later that day, I became the driver. When we arrived at the next village, it was quiet. The officer doesn’t like this kind of quiet. In front of a butcher shop little boys were squatting, shooting marbles in the dust. The officer told me to stop. I got out and went around to greet the boys. There were five of them, and a scrawny dog with three legs. The dog sniffed at my trousers. There was blood on them. The officer stood up in the jeep and looked down at us. From his attaché he removed a paper sack. He plunged his meaty hand inside and out came a wad of colorful wrapped candies. He held the sweaty fist of candy over the boys, waiting to drop it into their hands. The boys didn’t move. The tallest boy glared at me. I looked away. Eventually, the officer dropped the candy back into the sack. The sack rattled. He turned it upside down and shook it. Colorful candies rained down onto the dust. The dog hobbled over to inspect them. “Ask them where their fathers are.” I felt sick. A patch of skin on his left cheek flaked off in the hot wind. He opened his mouth to repeat the command but I’d already turned to the children and translated. The smallest boy replied before the tallest, the one who hated me, could clamp his hand over the little one’s mouth. “Well?” the officer asked. I looked at the boys, clutching onto each other. I looked at the pale animal carcasses hung up in the shop window. “Away,” I said. “Gone to look for work in the north.” The officer scrutinized me. I looked again at the boys. I wondered if the fathers were watching from their hiding places. I wondered if they were armed.</p>
<p>The officer stepped down from the jeep. His hand gripped the neck of the boy who’d spoken up; the others scattered. He put his pistol to the child’s temple.</p>
<p>The child shook. “Be calm…” I begged him.</p>
<p>“What did you say?”</p>
<p>“I’m telling him to be still!” I was shaking like the child.</p>
<p>“Why doesn’t his father come out? Ask him.”</p>
<p>When finally I could speak, I warned the child not to repeat what he’d said. I enunciated as if it were a question. I advised him to lie. I made promises I couldn’t keep.</p>
<p>The child’s eyes were enormous. A damp spot spread over the front of his shorts; urine trickled down his leg into his sandal.</p>
<p>The mother arrived, shouting, unafraid of the gun. The officer pushed the boy down into the candies.</p>
<p>“The men in this village are pussies. Tell her that.”</p>
<p>The woman resembled my sister. She looked at me. Hard. She gathered up the child and before she left, she made a gesture I understood as the transmission of a curse.</p>
<p>I climbed back into the jeep, still shaking. I drove the foreign officer away. That night the village was obliterated by bombs dropped from the foreign officer’s planes. And me, I survive.
