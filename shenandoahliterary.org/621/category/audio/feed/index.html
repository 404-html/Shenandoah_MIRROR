<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/06/nightwoods.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-649" title="nightwoods" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/06/nightwoods.jpeg" alt="" width="107" height="160" /></a>The lean, taut narrative of <em>Nightwoods</em> creates a story in which the setting holds as much spark as the characters, and is the central factor that brings forth the theme of the overwhelming power of nature. Charles Frazier writes about a young woman, Luce, who renounces the perils of civilization in favor of the raw beauty of the mountainous Appalachian South. In her self-exile, Luce attempts to find solace in the quiet mother the woods provides, but instead has to uphold the natural responsibility of taking care of her sister’s twin son and daughter after she is murdered by her husband, Bud. Unwittingly, Luce kindles a gradual maternal love for these children, and attempts to offer them security from their belligerent father while teaching them to tame their primal proclivity for fire. In this novel, Frazier offers depictions of various manifestations of nature—fire, the woods, the mountains—in such a way that underlines the bonds and emotions expressed by the characters. Though at times edging on the melodramatic, Frazier’s writing ultimately conveys the timeless message of survival and endurance.</p>
<p>Luce’s name speaks to her character, as <em>lucere</em> in Latin means “to shine.” Rather than allow her rape to smother her, she takes to the woods where her light becomes radiant. She embraces this secluded environment as preferable to the ugliness she had experienced at the hands of “civilized” mankind, for she considers “life” to have gotten “in the way” of nature. Her love for the wild becomes clear and is exemplified when she chooses to burn her canoe—her vehicle to society that made “town…only twenty minutes away.” She chooses to be an outsider and enjoys her removed existence. When she becomes caretaker to her niece and nephew, she recognizes the primitive, wild natures of these “tiny cavemen.” They are silent and communicate their angst through the physical act of destruction, markedly in setting things on fire. Yet, she is able “to shine” for these children and thus tame their rawness. Luce develops a love for them born of responsibility, a commitment stemming from her belief that “you take care of whatever needy things present themselves to you during your passage through [the world]. Otherwise you’re worthless.” With her love, she demonstrates to the twins that fire can be curbed to be warming, lapping flames of positive emotion.</p>
<p>Fire resurfaces throughout the novel as a metaphor for passionate emotion. Just as fire can be destructive when rampant and useful when controlled, too much passion can lead to vicious sentiment. Bud, the central antagonist of the novel, exemplifies this notion, as he justifies his flaming violence for its “spur-of-the-moment…purity.” After killing his wife, he passionately seeks to find the money he’s convinced she’s hidden. It is this drive that brings him to target his children. His desire utterly consumes him and can potentially consume all in his path, leaving devastation in his wake. The tempered love Luce exhibits works to stem this, in order to provide protection for her charges.</p>
<p>In essence, this is a violent story made palatable by Frazier’s measured and evocative prose. Though this characteristic of the novel actually interrupts any immediate pull to draw readers in, it provides a quiet strength akin to Luce’s that proves to be quite compelling. This is beautifully evidenced in the diction of the following descriptive passage where Luce reflects upon nature as an overwhelming force:<br />
&#8220;The black hole [of nature] was before life and beyond life. If you dipped a ladle of that water and drank it, visions would come so dark you wouldn&#8217;t want to live in the world that contained them. You&#8217;d be ready to flee toward the other darkness summed up in death, which is only distant kin to the black hole and the liquid it cups.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frazier fluidly guides the reader through <em>Nightwoods</em>, bolstering the inherent tension of his plotline through this understated style of writing.</p>
<p>Nature in its many guises becomes so important to this novel due to Frazier’s lush depictions, which indicate his profound knowledge of the region. He is able to manipulate natural elements and artfully integrate them into his story, implementing them as undercurrents to character interactions and relationships. In one of his many descriptions of setting, Frazier entwines fire and flora as, &#8220;poplars were already half bare and long grasses drooped burnt from the first frost. Bands of lavender and state clouds moving against a metallic sky, denoting the passage of autumn. Fallen leaves blown on the porch.&#8221; Though these passages add texture to his novel, there were perhaps so many of them that Frazier’s focus veered from adding depth to his plotline. For instance, in their shadow Bud began to seem like a caricature supervillain by the end of the novel, given no character depth aside from his bloodthirst.</p>
<p>The core value of <em>Nightwoods</em> lies in this novel’s superior construction. Frazier’s frequent use of fiery diction and imagery burns the book’s theme into readers’ minds, and adds to the notion of nature as an overwhelming force. Yet, perhaps the novel focuses too much on displaying Frazier’s writing toolbox rather than the core story, which was predictable at best. This can be easily forgiven, however, by relishing the descriptions Frazier offers of the Appalachian South of the late 1950’s. The enduring quality of nature is thus injected into the text, allowing <em>Nightwoods</em> to attain lasting literary worth.</p>

<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/05/yusef1.jpeg"><img src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/05/yusef1.jpeg" alt="" title="yusef" width="132" height="198" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-670" /></a><strong>Erudition as Disguise</strong></p>
<p>On occasion, an eager and adept reader happens upon a poetry collection that satisfies immediately. The lyric intensity of individual poems may carry the volume, or the narrative arc may be so compelling and taut that the reader shelves the collection knowing where the journey has taken her and that she’s been accompanied by a reliable guide.  <em>The Chameleon Couch</em> is not one of those collections.  In this, his eighteenth volume of poems, Yusef Komunyakaa employs a nearly overpowering display of erudition, a seemingly boundless range of historical and cultural referents, and a facility for metaphor and image, all of which combine both to dazzle and befuddle the reader.  Only a very small audience should approach <em>The Chameleon Couch</em> without a powerful search engine and adequate time for more than one reading.  The poems, however, ultimately justify the effort required to comprehend Komunyakaa’s purpose and how he goes about achieving it.</p>
<p>Frost suggested that a volume of poetry should be constructed well enough to serve as its own concluding poem. Most collections fall short on that count, but <em>The Chameleon Couch</em> is an exception. Recurring images link the three untitled sections, but the second section exhibits a thematic unity not evidenced in the first and third portions of the book.  Of the sixteen poems in the middle section, at least ten allude to, or explicitly refer to, war or combat. This is not a re-tilling of ground already plowed in <em>Dien Cai Dau</em>, although readers familiar with Komunyakaa’s biography and poems about his Viet Nam experiences may not be able to avoid making a connection.  What is striking in these war poems is Komunyakaa’s ability and willingness to focus relentlessly on the topic and yet do so in ways that remain fresh and surprising.</p>
<p>In the ekphrastic “Three Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion,” Komunyakaa explores a triptych painted by Francis Bacon.  War is never mentioned explicitly, but other horrors are:</p>
<blockquote><p>Did the painter ascend a dogwood<br />
or crawl into the hold of a slave ship<br />
to get a good view of the thing<br />
turning itself inside out beneath<br />
a century of interrogation lamps?</p></blockquote>
<p>The references to the crucifixion of Jesus (the dogwood legend), the slave trade, and torture convey with abundant clarity a tone of dread.  The poem requires no further investigation; but, as is the case often in <em>The Chameleon Couch</em>, a little mining yields treasure.  Here, a few clicks of the mouse will reveal that Bacon painted this bizarre and troubling work in 1944 at the height of World War II.  The poem’s images suddenly bear additional weight.  Komunyakaa then ends the poem with three of the most memorable lines in the entire collection, exhibiting both this poet’s mastery of image and his view that alienation, estrangement, and struggle are the critical markers of humankind’s existential situation—a perspective that permeates <em>The Chameleon Couch</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A twisted globe of flesh<br />
is held together by what<br />
it pushes against.</p></blockquote>
<p>The second section displays also Komunyakaa’s familiarity with Greek mythology and his ability to employ it in a way that, for the curious, motivated reader, adds additional texture to the poems.  In “Orpheus at the Second Gate of Hades,” the speaker is determined to make his second visit to the underworld despite unsettling recollections of the first visit – Furies, Tantalus, Tityus, Ixion, Sisyphus, Proserpine, and King Pluto.  Readers may be tempted to acknowledge Komunyakaa’s erudition and move on, shamed briefly by their familiarity only with the poet’s more contemporary allusions.  But that would be a mistake.  Poems like this one—and there are plenty here – require deliberate and resourceful reading.  The reader who is acquainted, or willing to become acquainted, with Greek mythology will be rewarded when the poem turns at line 41 to the speaker’s compulsion to speak of what he had seen:</p>
<blockquote><p>I saw a stall filled with human things, an endless<br />
list of names, a hill of shoes, a room of suitcases<br />
tagged to nowhere, eyeglasses, toothbrushes,<br />
baby shoes, dentures, ads for holiday spas,<br />
&amp; a wide roll of thick cloth woven of living hair.</p></blockquote>
<p>The interlocking of mythical suffering with the list of the spoils of a Nazi death camp demands the reader’s attention and genuine appreciation not only for the poet’s virtuosity but also for his deep humanity.  Making this poem—one of the collection’s most emotionally compelling—even more notable is Komunyakaa’s insertion of one of the few overtly humorous notes in the entire book.  Immediately prior to the speaker’s gruesome inventory, he hints at trouble getting through the gate:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . I don’t remember<br />
exactly what I said at the ticket office<br />
my first visit here, but I do know it grew<br />
ugly.  The classical allusions didn’t<br />
make it any easier. . . .</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the poems in the second section that does not address warfare explicitly offers another glimpse of the array of Komunyakaa’s cultural resources.  The immediate setting of “Blackbirding On the Hudson” is Czestochowa, Poland, where the speaker is reminded of the Hudson River when he pulls from the shelf a volume of poetry and opens it to Robert Lowell’s “The Mouth of the Hudson.”  The speaker recalls specific images from the Lowell poem, the “coke fumes &amp; the chemical air of / New Jersey.”  The Hudson’s flow and Lowell’s solitary figure, standing as if admiring the birds, calls to the speaker’s mind “another phrase—I think it is ‘blackbirding’— / pecking fiercely / at my gut.”  Besides echoing the vulture poised to tear at Tityus’s liver in “Orpheus at the Second Gate of Hades,” these lines mark a turn toward a complex reflection on the slave trade, the river’s permanent indifference in the face of its own despoliation, and the mood set by Thelonius Monk’s rendition of “Coming on the Hudson.”  As jarringly impressive as this plenitude of resources is, the reader will at some point in her reading ask whether Komunyakaa’s willingness to display his virtuosity with such abandon is a distraction and, if it is, whether that effect is intentional.  Before engaging that larger question, however, a brief look at poems in the first and third sections of the book is in order.</p>
<p>Although the first section of <em>The Chameleon Couch</em> is a looser thematic unit than section two, the poems here do share images and concerns that both permeate the entire collection and organize this portion of the book.  As with much of Komunyakaa’s poetry, music is a constant.  Expected allusions and explicit references to blues and jazz music and personalities appear in “Black Figs” and “Ignis Fatuus.”  More unusual is the poet’s meditation on a Japanese bamboo flute in “Ode to the Shakuhachi.”  That poem exemplifies the demands this collection places on the reader.  Komunyakaa’s reference to a famous piece composed for Shakuhachi, “The Sound of Deer Calling to One Another,” is not essential to the poem but invites the curious reader to investigate.  Perhaps it deepens subsequent approaches to the poem, but sometimes a distraction is just a distraction.</p>
<p>The volume’s opening poem, “Canticle,” forecasts the musical theme and puts the reader on notice that, although the poet will provide points of access, the trail will not always be well-marked.  Before shifting abruptly to a present tense East Village scene, one finds this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . Seasons sprouted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; went to seed as we circled the dance with silver cat bells<br />
tied to our feet.  Now, kissing you, I am the archheir of second<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chances.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because I know twelve ways to be wrong<br />
&amp; two to be good, I was wounded by the final question in the cave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; left side of the spirit level’s quiver.  I didn’t want to hug you<br />
into a cross, but I’m here to be measured down to each numbered<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bone.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A trembling runs through what pulls us to the blood knot.</p></blockquote>
<p>More hospitable—and thematically indicative of the collection as a whole—is another poem ostensibly related to Komunyakaa’s musical interests, “The One-Handed Concerto.”  The poet uses Ravel’s commissioned composition of the “Piano Concerto for the Left Hand” for Paul Wittgenstein, Ludwig’s older brother, to discuss absence, loss, and alienation.  Present at the same time is an instant of humor which, unfortunately, occurs too infrequently in this volume.  Both are at play when the poet reflects on the pianist’s war injury:</p>
<blockquote><p>Perhaps he could even forget &amp; snap<br />
the fingers of his lost hand to call his dog home,<br />
&amp; it would come running full trot, wagging its tail.<br />
But he didn’t know if he’d ever learn to play absence,<br />
because he could cover only one ear.</p></blockquote>
<p>Komunyakaa also includes in the first section what is arguably one of his best poems addressing racial oppression.  In “Cape Coast Castle,” the image of the slave trade center in Ghana before its relocation in 1877 follows the speaker and his lover from western Africa to Amsterdam and is pushed aside only by the ghost of his mother, and then only temporarily.  In a passage that, oddly enough, calls to mind the speaker’s realization in James Dickey’s “Slave Quarters” “that there is no hatred / Like love in the eyes / Of a wholly owned face . . . ,” Komunyakaa describes the “governor,” his selection of a slave woman to be brought to his rooms, and his approach to subjugating a race:  “There’s a whole tribe in this one, but I’ll break them / before they’re in the womb, before they’re conceived, / before they’re even thought of.”  Aside from the horror so effectively conveyed in this poem, the appearance of the ghost should not be overlooked.  It is one of at least seven references to ghosts in <em>The Chameleon Couch</em>.  Along with even more frequent invocations of the mask image and repeated references to shadows and labyrinths, Komunyakaa is hinting at the collection’s estrangement motif.  Images of impermanence and disguise abound in this first section.  With the ephemeral swamp gas in “Ignis Fatuus,” the “shape shifter” in “Ode to the Chameleon,” and the devil fish, makeup, sunglasses, and bleaching cream in “Ten or Eleven Disguises,” the poet is laying the foundation for a construct that is only visible in its entirety after the reader reflects upon the collection.</p>
<p>The third section of the book, by far the longest, is the least satisfying as a thematic unit; however, the miscellany is packed not only with echoes of poems appearing earlier in the volume but also of poems from prior collections.  In the concluding section, readers will note, for example, the reappearance of the Thorn Merchant in “The Thorn Merchant’s Godson.”  In addition to masks (“The Hedonist”), labyrinths (“Goodness,” “Surrender”), and ghosts (“Last of the Monkey Gods” and “Adonis in the Big Apple,” among others), this section also includes two overtly political poems, “Green” and “Dangerousness,” and the collection’s sole illustration of Komunyakaa’s facility with prose poems (“A Voice on an Answering Machine”).  Although traditional formal elements are not a distinguishing feature of <em>The Chameleon Couch</em>, Komunyakaa’s attention to sound effects in many of the poems is appropriate in a collection incorporating so many musical allusions.  One example from “Ontology &amp; Guinness” in this third section shows that, in addition to his obvious delight in manipulating theme, image, and cultural resourcefulness, the poet has not forsaken basic elements of craft:</p>
<blockquote><p>I can taste tear gas.  I hear a blur<br />
of billy clubs when I hit the drums.<br />
I haven’t witnessed this mug shot<br />
in decades, but I’m facing the mirror.<br />
I’m still the same man.  Almost.<br />
Led Zeppelin is still in my nogginbox.</p></blockquote>
<p>The slant rhymes, assonance, and alliteration are palpable, and examples of the poet’s fine ear can be found in almost every poem.</p>
<p>Yet image, metaphor, and allusion comprise this collection’s dominant currency.  Indeed, the volume is defined by the poet’s focus on image, the plethora of allusions, and the continual return to ideas of absence and estrangement combined with his persistent and effective efforts to deny the reader easy access while offering enough points of contact to keep the reader engaged.  Respect and admiration for a poet of Komunyakaa’s brilliance and resourcefulness requires that one assume that the poet intends every word and at least anticipates every effect.  He thinks about his audience and what their reaction might be.  It could be, of course, that Komunyakaa intends a very small audience for <em>The Chameleon Couch</em>.  But poems like “Grunge,” with its almost slapstick confusion of courtly love and Courtney Love, suggest otherwise.  Komunyakaa knows how to make a poem accessible.  He also knows how to make poems simultaneously difficult and rewarding.  “Flesh,” for example, certainly requires either prior knowledge of Dante and Beatrice or determination to figure it out.  Even poems like “Adonis in the Big Apple,” which will leave most readers scratching their heads about the identity of the protagonist (is it Jimmy Blanton?), invite—and then reward—curiosity and exploration.  Other poems, however, tease and seem to thwart understanding intentionally.  For example, there is no discernible reason, other than delight in the music, to insert into “Goodness” these lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . On how many paths<br />
do we dare seek the spun knot<br />
beneath the plum tree bent down<br />
with blooms in the Middle Kingdom?</p></blockquote>
<p>It would be sadistic to invite a reader into a poem with the sole intent of baffling her halfway in.  In that case, one might interpret the third section’s “Surrender” as less of a description and more of a command.  But Komunyakaa is not cruel.  Therefore, these poems that run along smoothly enough until stiff-arming the reader must have another intent, and only after coming back to the collection after at least one careful reading does one discern Komunyakaa’s masterful pacing and control.  Through the onslaught of mythical, musical, and historical allusions—through the back and forth of offering access and slamming the door—the poet makes a poem of the book, a poem willing to explore what is just beyond reach and the ways we hide ourselves for self-preservation, for life.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/05/Hollmeyer_IceRiver5.mp3">Hollmeyer_IceRiverHistoryMuseum</a></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;"> Dot hobbled along with her walker, making apologies for moving slow since her fall. The docent asked what happened, and she explained about the dark cat in the dark hallway. Then she pointed at his ankle and asked <em>him </em>what happened. He adjusted his pants leg so it covered the monitoring device. A dark man in a dark alley, he said.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The docent paused at the first room and held out his hand. This is what a nun’s room looked like. Here’s where she kept her vows. Here’s her bed, her bible, the sink where she splashed water on her face.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Dot and her daughter Mary stood in the doorway, feeling the thickness of the barrier rope against their shins.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">And here’s what their chapel looked like. Here’s a pew, a kneeler, an altar.<span>  </span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">This here is the religious artifacts room. The docent gestured to a headless mannequin modeling a faded habit. A forest of crucifixes grew around her.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">And the last room is the biggest one. The collected curios of Ice River’s residents. There was no rope here, so Dot and Mary stepped inside and followed the docent toward the doll collection.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">These are some of the finest porcelain dolls in the world, the docent said.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I used to have one just like that, Dot said, pointing to the one with chipped lips.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">They wandered among bookshelves stacked high with old photo albums, paperweight fetishes and a small herd of taxidermy — pheasants, mostly. There was Celia Smith’s candlestick collection, still dripped full of wax, and Thelma Logan’s wigs on plastic heads. She was the mayor’s mistress in the fifties, the docent said.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Yes, I knew her, Dot said. She lumbered ahead with her walker, past the record collections and on to the display of Patty Singleton’s crystal Christmas ornaments. I knew her, too, Dot said. She was a real bitch.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Mary didn’t think her mother was capable of saying that word — especially in a holy place, or a place that used to be holy.</p>
<p style="line-height: normal;">            Dot moved on, pushing past the docent. Here they are, she said, stopping mid-stride so that Mary nearly ran up on her heels. My elephants. A typed card taped to the shelf explained that there were a hundred and seventy-eight of them, made of ivory and wood and stone and brass and jewels.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“These are <em>yours?</em>” Mary asked.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Well, my goodness,” the docent said. “Thank you for your generosity.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“You never asked if I wanted any of these,” Mary said.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Because you don’t,” Dot said. “They only have meaning for me. When I worked at the embassy, I had friends from India and Africa and all over Asia, and they sent them for me to remember them by. But they’re all dead now.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I don’t think our donors have ever come in here. They’re usually dead, too,” the docent said. “We should interview you for the newsletter about the work you did.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Interview my daughter,” Dot said. “See if she can even tell you.”<span>  </span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I wouldn’t know what to say,” Mary said. “I’m still trying to figure out why you gave all these to a stranger instead of your only daughter.” She was staring at the leg where the docent wore his monitor.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Dot pulled a small white elephant from the back of a shelf. “Here. This one is for you.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Mary turned the misshapen lump in her hand. “Great. Thanks.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“See, you don’t know the value of anything. That piece is pure ivory. It’s three thousand years old.” Dot turned to the docent. “Bet you didn’t know that, did you?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">He turned red, as though he’d been caught stealing.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Mary looked the elephant in its dull eye and tried to imagine what it had seen in its long life that started before there was a difference between things that are holy and things that are not. But she couldn’t see that far, couldn’t see beyond this day, this walker plodding ahead of her, this handbag into which she dropped the elephant among the things that matter.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href='http://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/05/Althousefinal.mp3'>Althouse: Goran Holds His Breath</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The birds on the water have not heard him yet. Once they do they will burst upwards in flight and he will press the trigger. A gaggle of nine geese, necks huddled, drifts near the opposite bank. For a second the old farmer smells stuffed-goose, roasted on a spit. He kneads feathers on his fingers from cleaning past kills. The illusions—a warm fire, the taste of hot wine, the shelter of his chair after a good meal—are seductive. But he will not aim at the birds.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">At home he has the spit ready behind the kitchen, the fire set. His wife, Ingrid, assembled all the materials for a fruit and chestnut stuffing—twelve ounces of pitted prunes, an orange, six apples and a dozen chestnuts. She left these foods out on the kitchen counter as they agreed—for proof it was an accident when the police question him.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Goran Pettersson points the rifle away from the geese and looks again into the scope. Across the lake, still as glass, a doe stretches her neck toward the sky. The old farmer sees her ears pivoting, detecting. But he will not aim at the deer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The birds on the water have not heard him yet. The rifle is hard against his shoulder, the smell of metal burns his throat, and a rain of tears drowns his jaw. Goran does not want to enter his next minute. So he holds his breath.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Ingrid stands several yards ahead of him on the brown grassy slope of the hill where the birds will fly when they launch. She leans against her walking stick. She is as motionless as the doe, but is looking away toward the horizon where the sun begins to light. Goran turns the rifle toward her. In the scope he sees the long braid of her gray hair magnified, like a woven afghan—shades of silver, gray, ash blonde, white. He feels its familiar windings slide across his hand, from the thousand times he’s pulled her toward him.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">She is ten years older and from the beginning he always did what she said. Some called her bossy, but he never minded her ways. He knew he was prone to temper, easy to rile if things weren’t as expected, impatient around children. It was her decision not to have any. When they were younger and her father eventually died from the plaques and tangles in his brain, they began talking of their own deaths—in theory. One afternoon on a picnic, after wild loving on that same grassy hill—in the hour afterwards when he was always so grateful and would say yes to anything she asked—he had agreed to save her the agony of a long dying.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Now she stands there, watching the sun rise, trusting him completely.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The weight of the promise he made cuts into his spine. When the gun fires he fears his body will split, like a tree fractured in its fall.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Finally, he has to breathe. His exhale rustles the long grass where he stands.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The birds on the water blast off.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">But he lowers the rifle.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">When he does not fire, Ingrid turns, braces against her stick, and looks at Goran. After a while she shuffles down the hill toward him. He is afraid of her stare as she advances, that he has failed her, failed in his promise. He feels sweat run down his side, making his chambray shirt damp under his coat. His knees turn pliant and his lungs ache with the shame that has settled on him.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">But she walks past. Her eyes gaze blank, two holes in her face. She has forgotten why they came.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">He does not know what to do so he goes about his day. He mends the fence by the garden, sweeps the chicken pen, and picks ripe tomatoes for dinner salad. Sometimes, since he sold his cropland, keeping only his house and the property by the lake, he has to search for things to occupy his time. He does his chores slowly so they will last longer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">From outside he observes Ingrid through the windows. She passes back and forth behind the glass inside each room. He knows she will dust first and then vacuum. Sometimes, forgetting, she will dust again, starting over.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">They roast a chicken for dinner. He makes the stuffing. Afterwards they sit with coffee mugs at the bare kitchen table in their two straight-back chairs while the sun descends, darkening the room about them. Her hand lies still on the table top. He cups his hand over hers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Many mornings pass. Every morning Ingrid asks to walk to the lake.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">This new morning the birds on the water do not hear him yet. The birds on the water might be the same geese, older, or they might be descended from last year’s goslings or they might be new birds, just landed. The deer’s ears pivot in the scope, or it might be a jack rabbit with a twitching nose, or it might be a bob cat, still as a stone, anticipating prey. The rifle is the same rifle and it is loaded. Goran puts his finger gently on the trigger.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">His wife stands several yards ahead of him on the brown grassy slope of the hill. She is the same wife, but she is not the same wife.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The birds on the water have not heard him yet. He does not want to enter his next minute, or the next, <a name="_GoBack"></a>or the next. So Goran holds his breath.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>            </span>I’m eating rice krispies when my mother asks me whether I’d like to go to church camp. She pours corn flakes for my little sister and douses them with milk.<span>  </span>It’s March and snow is piled on the window sill.<span>  </span>Frost has tooled lace on the glass.<span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>“When?” I ask.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>“Next summer.” </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>Next summer seems like an eternity away.<span>  </span>First comes Easter, then my birthday in May, then summer.<span>  </span>My brother is swinging his legs under the table.<span>  </span>He kicks me accidentally and I kick him back.<span>  </span>So he kicks me on purpose and I kick him back hard. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>“Kids from lots of different churches will be there.<span>  </span>It lasts for a week.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span><span>  </span>My brother pokes me on the shoulder and I punch him on the arm.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>“Stop it, you two,” Mother orders.<span>  </span>Then she pulls out a chair and sits down with her bowl of Wheaties.<span>  </span>“Why don’t you think about it for a while,” she suggests shrewdly.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>I had never been separated from my parents over night.<span>  </span>But c</span>hurch camp offered the fabulous and real possibility of life without my brother and sister and without my parents.<span>   </span>No one would force me to pick the peas, or eat my slimy kohlrabi, or dry the ugly dishes, or go to bed while it was still light.<span>  </span>Six whole days of freedom stretched before me like a veritable midway of circus rides.<span>  </span>I could swim whenever I wanted, including after lunch.<span>  </span>My reading reveries wouldn’t be interrupted by my mother telling me to go outside and get fresh air.<span>  </span>I could get by eating nothing but cookies, and stay up all night.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>  </span><span>          </span>The Monday I set out for camp, my mother had to leave for work at seven.<span>   </span>I was already up and dressed.<span>  </span>I sat on my parents’ bed watching her pull on her white nylons and adjust the seams.<span>  </span>She powdered her chest above her bra and stepped into her nurse’s uniform. My father handed her the lunch he had packed for her and then we walked behind her to the car.<span>  </span>Her nylons made a reassuring whishing sound as she walked, but when she turned around to say goodbye, her face registered inclement weather.<span>  </span>She hugged me for several seconds longer than normal, then got into the car and twisted the key in the ignition.<span>  </span>The starter motor turned over, but she idled in the driveway, rolled down the window, stuck her head out, and said, <em>Don’t forget your sweater</em>.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">She backed the car a few feet, then stopped.<span>  </span><em>Give her a little money</em>, she said to my father.<span>  </span>He pulled out his wallet and handed me two dollars.<span>   </span><em>You’ll be okay, </em>she told me, flicking her head quickly.<span>  </span>Then she hastily backed out.<span>  </span>I felt delighted that she was going to miss me.<span>  </span>It gave me a sense of power.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">My father helped me fold and pack my Sunday dresses in our tan suitcase because I wanted to look cool at camp.<span>  </span>He had a heart condition, as my parents called it, which is why he’d sold his general store in Parkers Prairie, Minnesota and moved us to Lincoln, Nebraska, where my mother could get work.<span>  </span>In our new city he cheerfully scouted stores and vegetable markets for the family groceries, tended us kids, and sewed small cheesecloth bags of herbs for his savory vegetable soup.<span>  </span>That fall he had poured his energy into helping to establish The Lincoln Christian School in a church basement.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As I watched my princely sandy-haired father latch the suitcase with his freckled hands and buckle a belt around it, I began to feel slightly queasy.<span>  </span>I walked downstairs, carefully gripping the hand rail.<span>  </span>I stood beside my favorite spot in our back yard by the tiger lilies.<span>  </span>Closing my eyes, I tried to recover the reckless pleasure of being without any parents for a week, but I felt seasick, as if I were standing in a violently rocking rowboat.<span>  </span>The waves, pulling me farther from the shore, were not about to stop.<span>  </span>I was going to camp.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">A tenuous bunch of authorities ruled over us campers.<span>  </span>There was a director named Pastor Ray, who looked slightly goofy in his tight rayon shirt and brown pants.<span>  </span>A few parental volunteers stood around Pastor Ray, and a squadron of gangly kids worked behind folding tables.<span>  </span>They looked about the age of the high-schoolers I knew from church.<span>  </span>We were standing around a clearing in the woods.<span>   </span>Cabins were scattered around the edge, in the trees.<span>  </span>Above their doors, on posters, fat, cloud-shaped magic marker letters spelled out:<span>  </span><em>The Purple Dragons, The Holy Ghosts,</em> and <em>Nancy’s Storm Troopers.</em><span>  </span>One was called <em>Cabin Six.</em><span>  </span>I didn’t want to be assigned to Cabin Six, which I believed must have something wrong with it.<span>    </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Our counselors shoved one another, hooting and laughing as they checked off our names, allotted us sheets and pillows, and handed us our schedules,.<span>  </span>They ebbed and flowed like water, losing track of us briefly, retreating, whispering, buzzing, swarming in a group, then remembering their jobs, returning to their posts.<span>   </span>I didn’t know anyone except Audrey Jones, the friend of our family who had driven me to camp with her daughter, Marilyn.<span>  </span>She was talking with the other parent-volunteers.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Other campers went off with their friends, laughing and gabbing, holding their assignment sheets.<span>    </span>I was on my own, literally struck dumb by the high-jinks of the counselors.<span>  </span>I didn’t know which line to stand in and I was too shy to ask.<span>  </span>Hoping I was right, I added myself to the longest line.<span>  </span>When I got to the front, I faced a tousle-haired high school boy.<span>  </span>“Uh, I’m here for camp,” was my brilliant opening.<span>  </span>My words sounded far away and disconnected from me, like the voice of a ventriloquist.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Accepting the schedule and my cabin assignment and the whole unwieldy welcome packet, I juggled everything with my suitcase to the edge of the clearing where I stopped and put it all down in the brown pine needles.<span>  </span>Then I stooped over and picked up the documents one at a time.<span>  </span>I examined each, looking for some code explaining what I should do next.<span>  </span>Surreptitiously I watched other campers, trying to guess what the other girls were doing.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Many of them were rushing gracefully into one another’s arms, or screaming together with laughter as they crossed the clearing in small gangs.<span>  </span>That day, and truthfully every day after that, I watched with stupefied bewilderment as the other girls performed simple actions such as introducing themselves, or telling jokes, or playing volleyball, or testifying.<span>  </span>Many of them did these things with such elegance that I believed I had stumbled into a camp where everyone except me was destined to become Miss America.<span>     </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The camp schedule started with reveille, ran through breakfast, hymn sing, Bible study, lunch, quiet time, sports, crafts, free time, dinner, revival meeting, and campfire.<span>   </span>It ended with taps.<span>  </span>I didn’t know what any of these things were.<span>  </span>I discovered the next day.<span>   </span>Later I realized the schedule was something Pastor Ray could show our parents if they had any questions.<span>  </span>In practice, the drumbeat of the schedule turned out to be more irregular than it appeared on paper.<span>  </span>Above it I could always hear the soaring descant, the melody, the troubled, throbbing, torrid libretto of our counselors’ personal lives.<span><span> </span><span>  </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>I spotted the necklace on Monday afternoon, after unpacking my suitcase in my cabin.<span>   </span>I still remember that moment vividly, in the present tense.<span>   </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>Walking around the tables in the camp canteen, I see a small box holding a greenish plastic cross.<span>  </span></span>It’s about the width of a table knife and the height of a Popsicle stick, and it is affixed to a rawhide string.<span>  </span>I stand at the display table staring at it, keeping myself very still.<span>  </span>I can feel my heart beat in my wrists, which dangle at my sides.<span>  </span>In the stifling Nebraska summer afternoon, a trickle of sweat runs down my stomach.<span>  </span>I cannot believe how beautiful the cross is.<span>  </span>A little placard explains that it glows in the dark.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Glancing significantly at the grownup tending the cash register, so he understands that I am not stealing, I remove the cross from its box.<span>  </span>I stoop and thrust it into the shadows under the table.<span>  </span>It emits a minty light, which is entirely inexplicable, since the necklace doesn’t contain any light bulb or battery.<span>  </span>Shining beneath the table, it appears to be cutting into the darkness with its clear edges.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Mist clouds my eyes.<span>  </span>I want this cross the way a person wants health.<span>  </span>At Temple Baptist Church, where my family belongs, we believe it’s wrong to keep images.<span>  </span>Our sanctuary contains pews, facing a plain oak communion table and a podium.<span>  </span>We don’t keep religious symbols in our houses, either.<span>  </span>So I have never held a crucifix or looked at one carefully.<span>   </span>My aching love for this simple fluorescent cross in the palm of my hand is as astonishing as it is powerful and I haven’t the faintest idea at the time that my attraction to it is the first step of a journey that will lead me to a radical separation from my mother.<span>  </span>My problem at the moment is that the cross costs two dollars, and two dollars is the entire amount wadded up in the small red plastic coin purse back in my cabin, the amount my father handed me just before I got into Audrey Jones’ car yesterday and drove away from him.<span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">During weeks of dreaming about being at camp, I imagined buying soft drinks and cookies during breaks, wandering nonchalantly through the canteen with my hands in my pockets perusing the items carefully, weighing alternatives.<span>  </span>It feels lovely now, the possibility of putting my hand out to touch something, knowing that I could either choose that or move on to something else, knowing that I can touch something entirely different tomorrow and it will be mine too.<span>   </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I planned not to spend any of the two dollars on the first day.<span>  </span>I just looked.<span>  </span>What I had left was enough to buy something in the morning and in the afternoon every day for the rest of the week.<span>  </span>If I gave the man at the cash register my whole two dollars I would have to stop coming to the canteen, because I couldn’t bear seeing the crafts and candy and soda pop and books and book marks and plaques without being able to buy something.<span>      </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">So I made my feet walk out of the canteen past the cross, into the brilliant sunshine.<span>  </span>My feet felt sweaty in my tennis shoes. They didn’t want to leave.<span>  </span>Lifting them was as hard for me as lifting the heavy flatiron at my grandmother’s house in Pipestone, Minnesota, the one she set on the wood stove so it would heat up and she could press her dresses.<span>    </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>It’s Wednesday, after lunch.<span>  </span>I’ve gotten through two days and we are all hidden away from the consuming heat, resting on our bunks in our cool, dark cabin.<span>   </span>We can hear the sighing of the pines outside and a little breeze blows through the screened windows.<span>  </span>Our counselor, Nancy, checks the door to make sure no one is eavesdropping, then motions us campers to gather on the bunks around hers.<span>  </span>She confides in her hoarse, sensual voice, that the Lord is leading her toward John.<span>  </span>John has big shoulders and a beard.<span>  </span>He buries the camp garbage and builds the bonfires.<span>  </span>Just yesterday I saw John holding hands with Maureen.<span>  </span>I am astonished.<span>   </span>Does Nancy really think that God wants John to break Maureen’s heart?<span>   </span>My parents are intensely loyal to one another and it is just beginning to occur to me that people actually jilt and get jilted.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">As a mosquito buzzes in the humid early afternoon air, we sit, hushed.<span>  </span>I am stunned by the magnitude of Nancy’s confidence in us, waiting for her to unburden herself further. Nancy fishes in her purse and draws out a new lipstick.<span>  </span>She breaks the seal and screws out its tongue.<span>  </span>Then she passes it around, permitting us to test it on one another’s lips.<span>  </span>I am puzzled because I have been taught that wearing makeup leads to false pride.<span>   </span>It seems peculiar to me that a counselor at Bible Camp is pushing lipstick, but I’ve never held a tube of lipstick, and when I get my hands on it I feel a joyful flutter in my stomach.<span>   </span>I pass it to the girl on my left.<span>  </span>Before we resume Quiet Time, Nancy makes us hold up both hands, palms out, and swear to secrecy.<span>  </span>She plans to put a frog in John’s bed tonight.<span>   </span>As an afterthought she makes us swear that we will not get into mischief while she is busy with the frog.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>            </span>The amount of time our camp counselors spent climbing around in the Alps of teenage love damaged their judgment.<span>  </span>Maureen soon realized that Nancy’s objective was to gain the attention of Maureen’s boyfriend.<span>  </span>Under Maureen’s direction, her girls bolted our cabin door from the outside.<span>  </span>When a brown haired girl named Lavinia, who was the only camper quieter than I was, got up in the night to go to the bathroom, she couldn’t open the door.<span>  </span>I awoke to bumping and whispers.<span>  </span>Lavinia was wiping the floor with her pajama top.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">In our morning Bible study the counselors took turns giving testimonies about the Beatitudes, blessed are the meek, blessed are the poor in spirit, but cabin loyalty led to a system of tribal vengeance.<span>  </span>Nancy organized us.<span>  </span>During the revival service one evening, we propped a plastic pitcher filled with pancake syrup on Maureen’s cabin door so it would fall on whoever opened it first.<span>  </span>We threw sheets over our heads at midnight and waited for Maureen’s girls.<span>  </span>We hovered in silence among the ghostly trees by the dark, spooky path to the bathroom, not far from a massive stone we believed marked a grave.<span>  </span>One of the girls whispered to me that it denoted the place a former camper was buried, a camper, I thought, who might have been caught in the gears of heartbreak and revenge.<span>  </span>Trotting down the path to the bathroom, passing that stone, I could feel terror welling in my chest like a sparkly fountain, creating a romantic thrill that I now realize I must have nurtured, sometimes taking that path just so I could feel it again.<span>    </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Other pranks shocked me because they hovered outside the world I understood as civilized, which at that time meant the world of my family and our school.<span>  </span>One afternoon a counselor named Nate swam underwater, seizing and biting the leg of one of the fat, unpopular boys.<span>  </span>The boy, who thought he had been attacked by a shark, shrieked, and bounded out of the water.<span>  </span>He balled up his fists and screamed for a long time.<span>  </span>Everyone laughed.<span>  </span>It was supposed to be funny, so I laughed, but he never went swimming again.<span>  </span>Watching him sweat on the shore as we swam one day, I felt so sad for him that I didn’t get into the water myself.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Then some kids ran one camper’s pajamas up the flagpole so he had to sleep naked.<span>  </span>They stole and hid the silverware from the dining hall.<span>   </span>In our cabin, Nancy paged through <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Seventeen</span> magazine while we raced around and threw Rice Krispies at one another.<span>  </span>She painted our toenails the red of brake-lights.<span>  </span>She advised us about which boys she thought were cute and hinted at the sultry mysteries of sex.<span>  </span>I was so inexperienced that much of the time I was reduced to the status of a silent observer who was learning the jokes and gambits of an alien tribe. Meanwhile, the camp director sat in his shirtsleeves in the office, fanning himself and talking on the black telephone.<span>       </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>I was probably the smallest child at camp, and I had no inkling of the awakening that would befall me in a year or two.<span>  </span>For me the curtain hadn’t opened on the opera of adolescence.<span>  </span>I didn’t even know there <em>was</em> an opera.<span>  </span>Not that I wasn’t passionate.<span>  </span>That summer I lustily sang four part harmony:<span>  </span><em><span> </span>I’ve got a home in glory land that outshines the sun.<span>  </span>I’ve got a home in glory land that outshines the sun.<span>  </span>Do Lord, oh do Lord, oh do remember me, way beyond the blue.</em><span>  </span>They were the songs of my mother’s fundamentalist people, earthy and rowdy and I loved them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Then there were the lyrics that actually were love songs, though I didn’t yet comprehend that.<span>  </span><em>I come to the garden alone, when the dew is still on the roses and the voice I hear singing in my ear no other sound discloses.<span>  </span>And I walk with him and I talk with him and I tell him I am his own.<span>  </span>And the joy we share as we linger there, none other has ever known.<span>  </span></em><span> </span>I warbled the words with a reverent urgency that I didn’t comprehend as sexuality.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">And chow.<span>  </span>I adored chow:<span>  </span>fried chicken and mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, tapioca pudding, creamed cauliflower, all of it overcooked.<span>  </span>And cookies galore.<span>  </span>No one was making me eat carrots or liver.<span>  </span>We campers stood on the grass in a snaky line, breathing in the earthy aroma of baking bread, singing <em>Here we sit like birds in the wilderness, birds in the wilderness, waiting to be fed,</em> until the cooks opened the wide doors and we could heap our plates with white, starchy, abundant food unlike what my mother made at home.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">At night we huddled in a circle, mesmerized as the bonfire licked the sky with its yellow and red tongues.<span>  </span>I felt like a Neanderthal child:<span>   </span>close, folded into her tribe, safe against the enormous, feeling dark.<span>  </span>But during the day I walked around camp on the edge of tears, overwhelmed by the terrible facts I was discovering about the world.<span>  </span>Naïve as I was, I could feel the undercurrent of pulsing adolescent sexuality.<span>  </span>What did it mean?<span>  </span>I knew enough to be aware I was missing something, but what?<span>   </span>And then there was the fierce competition between cabins.<span>  </span>I began to wonder whether everything my mother had taught us at home as normal human behavior was actually deviant.<span>          </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">What brought on full blown homesickness in me was a tactless remark from some older girl, a sarcasm, some condescension that made me suddenly aware of how young I was, how terribly out of place.<span>  </span>The girl might have been Maureen, who by then had surrendered John to our counselor, Nancy.<span>  </span>I don’t remember.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">It’s mid-week and I am brushing my teeth in the rough-timbered, stinky bathroom.<span>  </span>The windows have been propped open and sparky bright morning air flows above the row of sinks.<span>  </span>Someone—say it’s Maureen&#8211;is standing beside me at the next sink.<span>  </span>She is a willowy high school girl with some power to say what happens at camp.<span>  </span>Her long, brown hair curls tastefully on her shoulders.<span>  </span>I feel a presence, and I look up at her, seeing that she is watching me, appraising me.<span>  </span>The glistening, hard black of her pupils in the middle of her blue eyes makes my heart hammer in my chest.<span>  </span>I work to breathe.<span>  </span>I feel like a flailing fish in a boat.<span>  </span>I try not to betray my alarm.<span>     </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>“Hi,” </span>I say through a mouthful of Colgate.<span>  </span>I have learned that much.<span>  </span>You have to greet people in the morning, even if you don’t feel like it.<span>  </span>Even if you never greet members of your own family at home.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">She tosses her hair back.<span>  </span>“Are you old enough for this camp?” she asks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I bet you’re not eleven!”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I’m ten.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>“Honey, Jesus wants you for a sunbeam</span>.”<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I’m not sure what she means by this, so I am unable to contribute a reply to the conversation she has honored me by starting.<span>  </span>In our church they sing <em>Jesus Wants You For A Sunbeam</em> at the children’s service.<span>  </span>The last time I sang it, I was about six.<span>   </span>It slowly dawns on me that Maureen must be telling me I am too young to be here.<span>  </span>I realize that she’s probably been watching me observe and then follow what the older kids do.<span>  </span>I wonder whether I appear even more bizarre than I feel.<span>  </span>I hear the water gushing from the faucet.<span>  </span>Outside there is the sound of tremendous flapping, as if wet sheets are blowing in a gale.<span>  </span>I see through the window a mob of startled crows taking to sky.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Maureen is standing with her orange toothbrush in her mouth, staring at me, waiting for me to reply.<span>  </span>I try to think of something, but my mind is blank and smooth as a bald gray highway going nowhere. I’m breathing fast.<span>  </span>I turn and begin brushing my teeth again.<span>  </span>She shuts the water off with a flourish and walks out.<span>  </span>That seems to put a period at the end of the long sentence of my weeklong childish incompetence.<span>  </span>Suddenly, after my conversation with Maureen, I long to go home.<span>  </span>I begin feeling what I later learn the word for.<span>  </span>I feel homesick.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">When I am done brushing my teeth, I walk to the canteen.<span>  </span>I saunter around the tables, pretending to be interested in the pastel candy with Bible verses printed on it or the fluorescent bumper stickers announcing that GOD IS LOVE.<span>  </span>But the cross reels me in a slow circle around it.<span>  </span>Finally I reach the table and pick it up.<span>  </span>I feel calmer.<span>  </span>I hold it in a shadow and it gives off lovely greening light.<span>         </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Homesickness is a disease that rivets its victim’s imagination on home so powerfully that nothing else seems real.<span>   </span>I, who had read <em>The Boxcar Children</em> and dreamed the pleasures of being an orphan, began suffering from an imagination entirely filled up with my mother.<span>  </span>I pictured her stepping into her car the Monday I left for camp.<span>  </span>I heard her voice calling my name over and over.<span>  </span>I smelled her Tweed perfume and felt her hand lightly on the back of my neck.<span>  </span>The very woodsy air I breathed stifled me.<span>  </span>I couldn’t eat.<span>  </span>I cried.<span>  </span>I vomited.<span>  </span>My head pulsated.<span>  </span>I feared talking to anyone, in case I might dissolve in tears.<span>  </span>I was infected with self-consciousness.<span>  </span>I watched myself like a homesick child in a movie who loses weight, dwindles, and slowly dissolves into the landscape.<span>  </span>The next day, I stayed in my cabin during Hymn Sing and Bible Study.<span>  </span>Pastor Ray didn’t notice.<span>  </span>Even Nancy didn’t notice.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Dutifully I went to craft time, where I lolled in front of bins of Popsicle sticks and clay and yarn strips and paper and sequins and glue and paints.<span>  </span>I could not think of a single reason to pick up any of it.<span>  </span>I needed to lie down.<span>  </span>I wanted to sleep.<span>  </span>The counselor in charge cheerfully tried to convince me to braid a lanyard, which he said I could use as a key chain.<span>  </span>He suggested different colors, the bright gold, the royal blue, the forest green.<span>  </span>The thing is, I didn’t own any keys.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Then give it to your mother,” he suggested.<span>   </span>I wanted to see my mother so desperately that the very word <em>mother </em>made me bolt from the tent.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">My mother’s friend, Audrey Jones, who had brought me to camp, drove up on Friday to volunteer.<span>  </span>She must have noticed that something was wrong with me.<span>  </span>She lured me out of my cabin by inviting me to the canteen.<span>  </span>She bought me a coke, and asked me whether I was all right.<span>  </span>She meant well.<span>  </span>But all I could see was how different she was from my cozy, black-haired mother.<span>  </span>She was athletic and plain-spoken, with a square jaw.<span>  </span>She had a habit of wearing anklets with heels.<span>  </span>As I sat at the table across from her, I couldn’t talk, I was so homesick.<span>  </span>I knew I was being monstrously ungrateful.<span>  </span>Her only crime was not being my mother.<span>  </span>But I was unable to stop the mawkish longing that this woman could not satisfy.<span>   </span>We listened to the rain beating on the canteen’s metal siding.<span>   </span>We sat together in awkward silence, a generous, concerned adult and the broken child she was trying to help.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The week at camp turned so ghastly partly because there wasn’t much adult supervision and our counselors were unprepared to manage a bunch of children.<span>  </span>And maybe my mother should have foreseen that.<span>  </span>But I need to explain.<span>  </span>She coyly lured me into signing up for this camp because I’d spent the previous August roving our neighborhood with a juvenile delinquent named Junior.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I took Junior with me one afternoon when my mother sent me to the supermarket down the block from our house to buy a bottle of catsup.<span>  </span>I had only been in the store a couple of times and as we strolled through the aisles I beheld a fantasy world I could barely believe.<span>  </span>We had just moved to Lincoln from Parkers Prairie, where my father’s General Store with its 8 aisles was the whole world of commerce.<span>  </span>But in this bright daydream of a supermarket I gazed at cartons of chocolate and pistachio and strawberry ice cream.<span>  </span>There were a dozen different kinds and colors of pasta.<span>  </span>There were cheeses of all shapes and colors and sizes.<span>  </span>I beheld Hershey bars and Mars bars and Heath bars and pink bubble gum with funnies and strings of licorice and chocolate frosting mix that our family could never hope to buy.<span>  </span>Pushing a cart, Junior and I started out with good intentions, but soon we were merely pretending to shop, stuffing licorice and Mary Janes and Hershey bars into our pockets.<span>  </span>Along the way, we dropped a bottle of catsup into the cart and stood in the check-out line and paid for it so we would appear legitimate and no one would suspect us.<span>  </span>We brought the catsup home to my mother and then made for our hide-out in Junior’s garage where we knocked back candy until my mother called me for dinner.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Some afternoons Junior and I lurked around houses in the neighborhood, sneaking onto porches and snitching whatever we fancied.<span>  </span>We invoked the “finders keepers” rule.<span>  </span>We figured that if people left toys and sprinklers out, our minor thievery might keep them from falling prey to even greater thievery. <span> </span>One afternoon we pillaged cookie samples from the garage of a Keebler salesman and ate them till we lay like fat ticks on his front lawn.<span>  </span>Afterwards, I felt vaguely guilty.<span>  </span>That evening when I saw a man heading for our front porch, I felt alarm.<span>  </span>His lunging walk and balled-up fists tipped me off.<span>  </span>I shouldn’t have taken the cookies.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">He rang our doorbell.<span>  </span>My mother answered the door.<span>  </span>He told her that her daughter had stolen and eaten the samples he needed to make a living.<span>   </span>He shouted loudly enough to attract attention from our neighbor, who stopped coiling his garden hose and watched.<span>  </span>The cookie salesman cursed and stomped his foot.<span>      </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">My mother slipped into her self-assured nurse persona.<span>  </span>“Oh, no, I don’t think my daughter would do that,” she informed him.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span> </span>He raised his voice.<span>  </span>He used words that were forbidden in our family.<span>  </span>My mother flipped the screen door lock to keep him outside and summoned me.<span>  </span>“This man says you went into his garage and took his cookies.”<span>  </span>I could feel her eyes evaluating me.<span>  </span>“You wouldn’t do that, would you?”<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span> </span>I swallowed back terror.<span>  </span>“No,” I told her.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">No.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">But my mother was not a fool.<span>  </span>Bible camp was her way of separating me from Junior.<span>  </span>Maybe she thought at Bible camp I’d experience a programmatic change of heart.<span>  </span>As it turns out, that week did set me on different path, but not one she would have chosen; she was a committed Baptist and religious images gave her the heebie jeebies.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">On Friday afternoon, I made a final journey to the canteen to look at the cross.<span>  </span>I’d taken that walk many times, even though I had decided early in the week that I couldn’t afford it.<span>  </span>Walking into the canteen tent, I saw they were having a sale.<span>  </span>The price of the cross had been slashed to a dollar thirty.<span>  </span>Noticing that I was eying it again, the man at the counter asked me how much money I had.<span>  </span>I showed him my dollar ten.<span>  </span>He took my money, slipped the cross in a bag, and handed it to me.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">For the first time during the entire week, I felt joy.<span>  </span>I crawled under the display table, where the cross illuminated the dark.<span>  </span>By its light I could see under the covers of my bunk.<span>  </span>And that night it lit up the path when I traveled alone to the bathroom.<span>  </span>Its Halloweeny radiance appeared transcendent to me, as it apparently did not to other campers.<span>  </span>There were almost as many necklaces remaining on the commissary table at the end of camp as there had been at the beginning.<span>   </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I don’t remember what happened to that cross.<span>  </span>During one of my many moves I must have given it away, probably because it bespoke a childhood I wanted to shed.<span>  </span>But it signaled a beginning, too, the first time I’d felt drawn to an image.<span>  </span>It was finally images and metaphors with their multivalent power that I followed out of my mother’s fundamentalism.<span>  </span>Now, as I sit here writing, I wish I could take the cross out again and look at it.<span>  </span>It was kitschy, I admit.<span>  </span>But I would make it stand for something, maybe for the fact that our most crucial decisions are small ones that start as secrets inside us and find their way out.<span>   </span>I’d let it stand for that mystery at the center of each of us and for the unpredictable, funny grace that can befall us&#8211;because it was grace, surely, that made me see the beauty of that cross.<span>  </span>I’d let the cross mark the first time I remember feeling the bitter-sweet longing we call homesickness and the first time I aligned myself against my mother’s literal way of seeing the world.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">On the bumpy ride back home with Audrey Jones, I looked forward to seeing my mother the way I looked forward to Christmas.<span>  </span>I wore the cross, holding it steady in a chute of sunlight that streamed into the car window.<span>  </span>I could almost hear the thing gathering whatever light it could into itself.<span>  </span>I wanted to show Mother how much light it gave off.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">When I got home, I did, I showed her.<span>   </span>“That’s nice,” she said and opened the oven to check whether the squash was done.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">She had not been homesick for me, of course, and she had no way of knowing that I had been homesick for her, because I didn’t know how to tell her.<span>  </span>And how could she know that I had been set on a path to collide with her most deeply felt and believed faith?<span>  </span>I didn’t know it yet myself.<span>  </span>Like much of what’s important, that remained secret.<span>  </span>Mother made a cake and the whole family celebrated my return. <span> </span>But that night, in my own bed, I watched the cross slowly pay out radiance into the darkness.<span>  </span>As the day around it failed and night came, it grew steadily more articulate, its edges sharpening against the dark.<span>  </span>It seemed like a star that had fallen to earth, something a person could navigate by.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href='http://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/05/soothsaying-audio.mp3'>Soothsaying Audio</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"> The clanking of the car’s engine ceases a few miles outside of town and Cliff and I settle into it, the wide quiet. We’re told that here, high up and in fall, aspens turn whole mountains gold.<span>  </span>I twist the knob on the radio, though it’s been broken for years.<span>  </span>We listen, instead, to rubber on asphalt.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">For a while I watch the scrub, scouring the beige sand for coyotes or jackrabbits.<span>  </span>Then, looking down I notice the specks of coffee and dust in the vinyl lining of the emergency brake.<span>  </span>My husband, Cliff, stares at the road, the yellow lines finally disappearing.<span>  </span>He’s from the desert and so he likes this, this alien blue sky, the way the road out in the distance wiggles and turns into a lake.<span>  </span>I’m from the coast.<span>  </span>I miss the trees, the way they hide wires and facades, the way they block up the view.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Because it’s quiet, because we are the only people we know here, Cliff and I argue.<span>  </span>It’s nothing serious.<span>  </span>He leaves his clothes in the washer until they’re dried to the sides and must be peeled away.<span>  </span>If I ask him to take out the trash, he asks me to pick up my clothes. This morning we argued about eggs, whether when you poach one, you put vinegar in the water.<span>  </span>Oh, the quiet—the big brown mesa out our window blowing air and dust and birds, the way it turns us toward each other like opposing magnets.<span>  </span>He’s still sore at me for asking him if he ever poached an egg.<span>  </span>“It’s not what you <em>ask</em>,” he said, leaning forward with his shoulders.<span>  </span>“It’s how you ask it.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Today, we’ll find the aspens.<span>  </span>But, Cliff seems to say with his jaw, with his arms locked in front of him like two table legs, this doesn’t mean he forgives me.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Let’s play a game,” I offer.<span>  </span>Cliff pushes back into his seat, listening. I remove my feet from the glovebox, leaving a dusty grid.<span>  </span>“Tell me a story.<span>  </span>Something I don’t know about you.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">He uses his thumb to flatten the hair above his sideburns.<span>  </span>Last night, during a peaceful interlude, I trimmed them.<span>  </span>Now they look shorn while the top of his hair puffs up, a shiny mushroom.<span>  </span>He’s clearly wrestling with it—whether to succumb to the invitation, filling the car with friendly chatter or refuse, keeping the petulant, if ridiculous, chill.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Cliff watches the road for a while.<span>  </span>He keeps mints in the cup holder and now he reaches for one.<span>  </span>It crunches between his teeth.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">We drive over a dead gopher and Cliff shakes his head slowly.<span>  </span>He’s a failed vegetarian, but the sight of road kill makes him pensive.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“What kind of story?” he asks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“I don’t know.<span>  </span>Something you’ve never told me.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Give me a topic,” he says.<span>  </span>I touch his hand on the steering wheel and briefly, he takes his other hand and puts it on top of mine.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Injuries or scars,” I say, because why not?<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“You already know about my scars,” he says, which is true.<span>  </span>He had a large mole removed from his thigh when he was young and it left a raw pink line which he sometimes claims is a shark bite.<span>  </span>He has a small white storm of marks on his ankle from getting caught in some barbed wire.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“The next time we see a gas station, we have to stop,” he says.<span>  </span>“Did I ever tell you about Shane and the BB gun?” I watch the little black arrow on the gas gauge hover over the white square.<span>  </span>The gas light flicks on.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“No,” I say.<span>  </span>“God, do you remember when everyone had a BB gun?<span>  </span>A kid in my first grade class had a BB embedded in his neck.<span>  </span>You could feel it if you put your fingers on the right place.”<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Cliff glances at the gas light.<span>  </span>He takes another mint.<span>  </span>When he chews, the hollows of his cheeks suck in, making deep caverns.<span>  </span>He hasn’t shaved.<span>  </span>Little flecks of copper and gold wink from the indentations.<span>  </span>“It was that kid, Todd, the one I told you about, the one whose mother brought in super-eight footage of his birth,” I say.<span>  </span>I’m thirty-four and still, whenever someone tells me they’re pregnant, I conjure Todd’s mom hanging from stirrups, screaming like her skin was on fire.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Cliff and I talk about having children—two maybe, even three, but we’ve never actually tried.<span>  </span>Sometimes at night, I pat at the space between us and say, here she is, our Josephina, our Noah, our little progeny.<span>  </span>For a few years, Cliff played along, contributing geographical baby names: Topanga, Tonopah, Sierra.<span>  </span>But now it’s become routine, an airy joke.<span>  </span>Often, he just ignores me.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>He sees a sign and circles back to the last Allsup’s before the mountains.<span>  </span>Leaving the nozzle in the car, he walks into the mini-mart.<span>  </span>The passenger seat won’t move back, no matter how much I try to force it, and when I reach under to wiggle the crank, I find an empty wine bottle there, escaped from the recycling.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">My mind flits to a story I heard in school years ago.<span>  </span>Apollo, god of light and music, is struck by the beauty of a sibyl. What will she trade him for one night in bed?<span>  </span>She considers it.<span>  </span>This is a sharp sibyl and she sees her chance.<span>  </span>He’s a god.<span>  </span>What else to wish for but eternal life?<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Time passes, though, and the sibyl has a change of heart.<span>  </span>She doesn’t want to sleep with him, doesn’t want to hold up her end of the bargain.<span>  </span>It doesn’t take Apollo long to tilt the scales back in his favor.<span>  </span>He’s given her eternal life, but not yet eternal youth.<span>  </span>So, the sibyl ages—and ages forever—growing smaller and smaller as she does.<span>  </span>When she’s finally as small as a grain of sand, she’s swept into a bottle at the ocean’s edge, trapped in a prison of glass.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>It’s moments like these, with a story in my head, that the absence of little Josephina is most pronounced.<span>  </span>She appears, but in ghost form.<span>  </span>I can almost feel her.<span>  </span>Her fine hair is a version of my own, coppery with a corkscrew curl.<span>  </span>She listens to the myth or the song on the radio and I feel a sweep of understanding.<span>  </span>I will leave the world someday, but she will carry our history in these details.<span>  </span>The time I told her the myth while waiting for Cliff to fill the tank.<span>  </span>The way the sun warmed the plastic dash, the fungusy smell of the car.<span>  </span>These things will crawl inside of her like seeds, becoming both important and frivolous, the way history does.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>I would tell Josephina that a sibyl knows everything.<span>  </span>She can see war coming to her country, she can see her friends in peril.<span>   </span>If she were free, she’d have the power to change this, but she’s not free.<span>  </span>She’ll see her predictions come true through the fog of sea-salted glass, growing even tinier, even more insignificant.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><em>I want to die!</em> she’ll cry in her tiny voice.<span>  </span><em>I want to die!</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Cliff tosses a bag of chips at me.<span>   </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“They only had that kind,” he says.<span>  </span>“Super Nacho Cheese with Jalapeño.”<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">A cartoon animal on the front of the package looks like he’d like to lunge at my throat.<span>  </span>I stick the chips by my feet.<span>  </span>Cliff finishes up the gas.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I pick the bottle up and check it for sibyls.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“That’s my emergency plan,” he says, climbing back in.<span>  </span>“Since I refuse to get a cell phone.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">It takes me a minute to understand.<span>  </span>“And float it in what ocean?” I ask.<span>  </span>He shrugs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“God will provide,” he says.<span>  </span>“Open the chips.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The bag’s swollen from the elevation and makes a whooshing sound when I tug.<span>   </span>The quiet happens again.<span>  </span>Two cars pass, making wind.<span>  </span>A large black bird hangs in the sky.<span>  </span>We’re headed up now, then down into a small canyon where some adobes are sprinkled at random, then up again, climbing the side of a mountain.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“It was in Reno,” Cliff says.<span>  </span>“When we lived in Reno, me, my mom, and that guy Ray.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I’ve heard about Ray.<span>  </span>I imagine he was wound too tight, his jaw just skin over a series of pulleys and wires.<span>  </span>Oiled black hair and an oiled black jacket and oiled black shoes.<span>  </span>A belt buckle that sagged toward the floor.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Well, Ray was married when he was seeing my mom.<span>  </span>I told you that, right?<span>  </span>He had this wife.<span>  </span>I can’t remember her name—Pricilla, Prissy—she came around every once in a while.”<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>I put a woman with oily Ray.<span>  </span>One of those women who lack moisture, whose face stretches taught against bone.<span>  </span>She wears a dress—no a waitress uniform.<span>  </span>Light blue with an apron.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Cliff reaches for more chips.<span>  </span>One has fallen onto his tee shirt, defying gravity.<span>  </span>It sits there, cockeyed, at an improbable angle, like a small invisible hand props it up.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“She got a boob job.<span>  </span>That I remember.”<span>  </span>He shakes his head.<span>  </span>“Is that even possible?<span>  </span>Were people getting boob jobs in the late seventies?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“I’d guess yes.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Well, one day she came to the house to pick up her son, Shane.<span>  </span>I guess Ray had joint custody or something.<span>  </span>Shane stashed all these low-budget porno magazines in our shed, so we used to go out there.”<span>  </span>Cliff widens his eyes and makes a smooth, angel face. “Of course, I never looked at the magazines,” he says.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Right.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Prissy was just some older lady, but that day she arrived with a rack like you’ve never seen.<span>  </span>Made a big impression on me.<span>  </span>I was ten.”<span>  </span>He takes another handful of chips.<span>   </span>The rack doesn’t fit with my light blue uniform.<span>  </span>I try to reinvent her—polyester tee shirts?<span>  </span>Low cut blouses?<span>  </span>But now my images are muddled.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Shane had this BB gun.<span>  </span>These chips are gross.<span>  </span>The jalapeño tastes like motor oil.”<span>   </span>Cliff tosses his handful back in the bag, then wipes his hand on his shorts, leaving a small orange dusting.<span>  </span>“I have no idea if Ray got it for him, or if he borrowed it, or if it was from one of his mother’s boyfriends.<span>  </span>Because I remember a lot of boyfriends involved in this Ray thing.<span>  </span>There was Ray, my mom’s boyfriend, but then there were these huge guys with wolves for pets that tagged along with Shane’s mother.<span>  </span>And Ray would get really drunk and cry on the back porch and sometimes my mom would kick him out.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Cliff’s hands clench and unclench around the wheel, his mind skimming over its own history.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Shane had the gun,” he says again.<span>  </span>“And so, obviously, we had to go shoot some stuff.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Obviously.”<span>  </span>I pick the chip off Cliff’s shirt.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Neither of us could drive yet.<span>  </span>Shane put the BB gun in a duffle bag and we got on a bus out of town, this bus that went to the edge of a housing development.<span>  </span>You could walk straight into nowhere after the last house ended.” <span>          </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“You were ten?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“I know.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>For a woman who soothed dying people for a living, who saw that life was temporary, Cliff’s mother, Connie, was surprisingly oblivious to danger.<span>  </span>She dated men with gun racks, knife collections and special radios.<span>  </span>Once, she rode on the back of a motorcycle wearing nothing but a negligee.<span>  </span>I met her two years before she died, after her exotic beauty had given way to a muted and fleshy facade.<span>  </span>She had the coloring of a Christmas dinner—ham and bread pudding, overboiled green beans.<span>  </span>But photos of her young capture sharp shoulders and lithe arms, a butt poured into dark denim.<span>  </span>In a few she winks, as if she knows a secret.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Shane wanted to shoot lizards.<span>  </span>So we did.<span>  </span>We shot maybe six of them.<span>  </span>They were sunning on the rocks and we just picked them off.<span>  </span>I don’t think we missed even one.”<span>  </span>It’s odd he doesn’t cringe, this man who softens over the sight of a gopher smeared like jam over the asphalt.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“And then, the weird part,” Cliff said.<span>  </span>“Shane wanted me to take the gun.<span>  </span>He put it in my hands and he dared me to shoot my own foot.<span>  </span>I said no. He said it would feel good.<span>  </span>I asked him if he’d done it, shot his own foot.<span>  </span>And Shane pulled up his pant leg and showed me a whole mess of scars, a million tiny white bumps and lines.”<span>  </span>He reaches for the chips, but changes his mind.<span>  </span>“Do you have any gum?” he asks.<span>  </span>I don’t.<span>  </span>“Water?” he asks.<span>  </span>I hand him my Nalgene.<span>  </span>He drinks for what seems like a long time.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“And then?” I say.<span>  </span>Cliff takes another swig of water and wedges the bottle between his thighs.<span>  </span>He taps his thumbs on the wheel and curls his lips around his teeth.<span>  </span>He sits there lipless, remembering.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Shane got really intense.<span>  </span>He took my hand and tried to force me to shoot myself.<span>  </span>I didn’t want to do it, but I was only ten and I wasn’t as strong as him.<span>  </span>Finally he managed to get me pinned beneath him, but he couldn’t hold me down and make me shoot at the same time.<span>  </span>The gun was actually a little ways off in the dirt. Shane said he’d only let me go if I shot him.<span>  </span>I haven’t ever told anyone this,” he says.<span>  </span>“It’s not really a story.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span> </span>“Well, I want to know what happens.<span>  </span>Did you shoot him in the leg?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Yes,” Cliff says. He curls his lips around his teeth again.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“You shot him in the leg.”<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I defrost Cliff from old photos I’ve seen of his childhood.<span>  </span>He’s in a yellow soccer jersey and he’s grinning, smashing his eyes to slits, a front tooth cockeyed, his cowlicks untamed.<span>  </span>I try adding a gun to the visual, but as soon as I do, the whole thing collapses.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I shot him in the leg. He picked up the gun and handed it to me then he turned around.<span>  </span>I got him in the back of the calf.”<span>  </span>Cliff hunches his shoulders.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I’m about to ask what it felt like, that moment the metal hit skin. But before I can ask, Cliff jerks the wheel to the right to take a turn.<span>  </span>“Is this what we’re looking for?” he asks.<span>  </span>Indeed, a green sign points the way.<span>  </span>The car flies over a series of potholes, causing us both to jolt forward.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Slow down,” I say.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“No kidding,” he says.<span>  </span>“Anyway.<span>  </span>Shane wanted me to touch his bleeding calf.<span>  </span>He grabbed my hand.<span>  </span>He just kept staring at me, like in a creepy way, romantic, sort of, like he was going to lean in.<span>  </span>And he was holding my hand.<span>  </span>So finally, I took a rock and punched him with it.”<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I can tell this is the part of the story, more than the gun, more than the creepy staring, that Cliff doesn’t like telling.<span>  </span>One side of his face looks cramped.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Shane didn’t do anything.<span>  </span>He just let go and covered his eye.<span>  </span>I walked back to the bus stop.<span>  </span>I had no money so I had to beg my way on.”<span>  </span>Cliff takes another mint.<span>  </span>The hollows happen. An ancient van looms in front of us and Cliff slows the car.<span>  </span>Someone has written <em>bite me you cougar</em> in the dirt on the back window.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“My mom broke up with Ray.<span>  </span>She said he drank too much.<span>  </span>And that was the end of Shane.<span>  </span>We never saw each other again.”<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">“I wonder what he’s doing now,” I say.<span>  </span>Cliff shrugs.<span>  </span>“Do you think he remembers it?” “Sure,” Cliff says.<span>  </span>“Wouldn’t you?”<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">And it’s true that these are the things you hold onto and don’t tell.<span>  </span>Because they’re weird, the wishes people make, the things we make come true.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“How come you’ve never told me that?” I ask.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“It’s not the kind of thing you tell,” he says.<span>  </span>I know what he means.<span>  </span>I take my thumb and run it over the prickly hair on his neck.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“It’s not such a bad story,” I say.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“You got worse?” he says.<span>  </span>I run my thumb over his neck again.<span>  </span>“Bite me you cougar,” Cliff says.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Do you know the story about the sibyl in the bottle?” I ask.<span>  </span>Cliff squints.<span>  </span>He shakes his head.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>I tell him about her, about how Apollo wants her then traps her.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">We sit quietly feeling each turn of the car.<span>  </span>The fall has frozen the air.<span>  </span>It has that particular quality of cool; it mutes the trees.<span>  </span>Even the bark looks grayer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“That’s a sad story,” Cliff says.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“There are a lot of sad stories,” I say.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Why didn’t she just sleep with him?” Cliff asks.<span>  </span>“He’s the sexiest god, right?”<span>  </span>I roll the bottle back and forth with my toe.<span>  </span>“What’s one thing I don’t know about you?” he asks.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>I’m not as good at things like this.<span>  </span>I can feel the feeling: that whirring sense of being unmoored by my own trespass.<span>  </span>But the only memory I have, the only one that fits this game, is one I don’t feel like telling.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“I used to step on ants outside and then try to heal them with Children’s Tylenol,” I say.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“That’s it?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“I once let a whole jar full of grasshoppers go in the living room.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Cliff shakes his head. <span> </span>“I’m never telling you anything again,” he says.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Okay, I know something.<span>  </span>I had a Spanish teacher in high school, Mr. Lombardi, who used to always threaten to give me a bad grade.<span>  </span>He said I was too quiet.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Hard to believe.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“My friend Kelsie said to go and talk to him.<span>  </span>She said if you went to talk with him, he’d be reasonable.<span>  </span>Kelsie was an awful student, but she always got As in Spanish.<span>  </span>Kelsie also had a big rack, to use your poetic phrasing.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Cliff smirks and brushes his eye with his hand.<span>  </span>One eyebrow sticks up, pointing to the dotted roof of the car.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“She was stacked,” I say.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“I get it,” Cliff says.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“But she was plain and none of the guys really liked her.<span>  </span>So anyways, I walked up to the door and the first thing I saw was Kelsie and Mr. Lombardi in the corner near the map of Mexico.<span>  </span>Then I saw that the map of Mexico was weirdly crinkled.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Uh oh.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Mr. Lombardi had both hands up her shirt.<span>  </span>Kelsie was sealed to the map, going up and down with his hands.<span>  </span>And she saw me.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“What a perv.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“I backed up and waited for her around the corner.<span>  </span>I said we should go to the principal.<span>  </span>That year we had a new principal, a woman.<span>  </span>I was excited to get Mr. Lombardi in trouble so I could avoid a C in Spanish.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“That’s why I love you.<span>  </span>Always thinking of others.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“But Kelsie said that if I told anyone, she would never speak to me again.<span>  </span>To this day, I’ve never seen anyone so certain, so—I don’t know—possessed.<span>  </span>She looked like this.”<span>  </span>I point to the lunging animal on the bag of chips.<span>  </span>“Years later, when we were both home for Winter Break, Kelsie told me that she lost her virginity to Mr. Lombardi on his daughter’s bed.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Gross,” Cliff says.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Yeah. She said she wished it would happen with him and it had.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“She wished to lose her virginity on the Spanish teacher’s daughter’s bed?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“I guess.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“So what’s the moral of your story?” Cliff asks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“What’s the moral of yours?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Cliff shrugs.<span>  </span>“Don’t take the bus,” he says.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“I never took another language class,” I say.<span>  </span>“Even in college.<span>  </span>I stayed away.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Is that the moral?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Does there have to be a moral?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I roll the window down.<span>  </span>Clouds are creeping in from the west. My sister, Kate, says that every year, people from the coasts go into the Rockies, the Sandias, the Jemez, and they don’t know about flash floods or lightning.<span>  </span>They bring cheese and specialty bars wrapped in foil, then wham, they’re dead.<span>  </span>She told me this when she came to hike in these very mountains.<span>  </span>It’s as though, by acknowledging this, she avoids that fate.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Does knowing help?<span>  </span>Sibyls are supposed to see into the future.<span>  </span>Couldn’t this one?<span>  </span>When she said no to Apollo, she didn’t see herself trapped in the bottle, wishing to die?<span>  </span>Or was that <em>why </em>she didn’t sleep with Apollo?<span>  </span>Did she know that the outside world, from the captivity within glass would glow brighter and brighter?<span>  </span>That because of the glass, the world inside of her would go vivid with longing and despair?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">In the distance, I see a yellow stand of aspens, but the car turns into some thick juniper and cottonwoods and they disappear.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Do you think he wanted to put something in or get something out?” I ask.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“What?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Do you think the point was to make a scar or to let something out, through the skin.<span>  </span>You know, like bloodletting.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Shane?”<span>  </span>Cliff moves his head slowly in a no.<span>  </span>“I couldn’t tell you.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>The wine bottle rolls under the seat and hits something metal.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span><span> </span>“If Apollo gave you one wish, what would you wish for?” I ask.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“To not have to sleep with Apollo,” Cliff says.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“I might wish for a baby.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Cliff looks at me sideways.<span>  </span>“It would come out half-god,” he says.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“It would come out, though.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Yes,” he says.<span>  </span>“I suppose so.<span>  </span>But maybe through the crown of your head.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“A baby for every grain of sand.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“A baby for every turning tree,” he says, “and you would be one busy woman.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>And then there they are, yellow as a room of canaries.<span>  </span>This is what they do at the end of their season—yelp this color into the desert sky, then send it scattering to the red ground.<span>  </span>Cliff parks the car under a stand of them.<span>  </span>I open the door.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“Look at that,” Cliff says, pointing to a rainstorm of leaves, sent sailing with a wind.<span>  </span>His brow relaxes.<span>  </span>In typical desert fashion, the blue sky of the morning has transformed to dark clouds.<span>  </span>There will be storms tonight. The trees will go silver with winter.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Cliff’s mom told me about a client once, a fourteen-year-old girl dying of leukemia.<span>  </span>I was sitting on the sofa after brunch, stuffed to the gills, watching a cartoon and she just told me, out of the blue.<span>  </span>All this girl wanted was for a particular boy to come to her bedside.<span>  </span>She talked of nothing else.<span>  </span>But when the girl’s friends finally dragged the boy there, the girl wouldn’t look at him.<span>  </span>She was embarrassed by the state of her skin.<span>  </span>Then she died.<span>  </span>Connie finished this story, slapped her thighs, and got up to clean some counters.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Cliff arches his back.<span>  </span>“Let’s walk,” he says.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“It’s going to storm.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I know,” he says.<span>  </span>Far off over another set of hills, the first lightning flashes.<span>  </span>The wind moves slowly.<span>  </span>The world seems to shiver under its big hand.<span>  </span>Families in colorful jackets pack their cars, fleeing the mountains.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Cliff closes his door, but I wait, caught for a moment.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I try not to think about it, this one thing.<span>  </span>The memory—even just a hint of it—makes my skin cringe all at once, like a sheet ripped from the line.<span>  </span>I was ten when my mother decided to foster Derrick.<span>  </span>My father had just left us—a trial separation everyone knew would last.<span>  </span>My mother needed a project.<span>  </span>I’m not sure how we qualified; maybe she lied on the forms, maybe she and my father had interviewed before he left.<span>  </span>Derrick was fourteen, skinny and big-eyed.<span>  </span>He’d been beaten up at the group home, probably because of his willowy build, the way his hands tapered like a girl’s. He arrived with a black eye and a brown duffle bag.<span>  </span>My mother set him up in the room that used to be my father’s study.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">In the first weeks, Derrick drew into himself like a sea snail snatched from its rock.<span>  </span>And his silence lured out of my mother a warm, maternal heat.<span>  </span>“How was school?” she’d ask him in a way that she never asked me, her eyes damp and curious, her mouth parted in anticipation.<span>  </span>He’d mumble fine, and try and walk away, but she’d try harder, following him with questions about his homework, his school supplies, sports, and friends.<span>  </span>She urged me to sit next to him at dinner, to ask him to go swimming at the Y.<span>  </span>She assigned the two of us chores to do in tandem—planting a berry patch out back, reorganizing the pots beneath the stove.<span>  </span>When he wasn’t around, she asked me my opinion.<span>  </span>How did I think he was doing?<span>  </span>Did he say anything to me about being happy or sad?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">It makes sense to me now.<span>  </span>She wasn’t playing favorites.<span>  </span>She was trying to make up for the world’s bad temper, compensate for Derrick’s hard luck, put some pennies in his cosmic bank. She must have known, as I didn’t, that his mother wouldn’t get out of jail, that Derrick would spend the next years in a world of unstable charity.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Derrick stayed away from me as much as he could.<span>  </span>He understood that he was treading on someone else’s turf.<span>  </span>If I came in to talk to my mother while the two of them watched television, he’d get up and go to his room.<span>  </span>Once—how this came to pass, I can’t recall—he let me sit on his bed and read the comic books he stored in the nightstand.<span>  </span>He stood at the mirror and asked me if he should cut off the long floppy bangs that shielded his eyes.<span>  </span>I liked him in that moment.<span>  </span>I felt important—let into a world of older kids and their concerns.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">My mother tried and tried.<span>  </span>She bought him new shirts, the baggy shorts all the boys were wearing, even a skateboard. But she couldn’t quite get him to relax.<span>  </span>He ate his meals quietly and rinsed his plate.<span>  </span>He kept all his clothes neatly stacked in the drawers, his duffle bag folded atop the dresser.<span>  </span>It was as if he expected, at any moment, to have to leave.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">One Saturday, a couple of months after he arrived, she told me she wanted to take him out to the lake, just the two of them.<span>  </span>Nature might do him good.<span>  </span>I’d understand, right?<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I went to my friend Jenny’s house, but I remember the feeling of that day so clearly.<span>  </span>I was a ringing thing, a bell chiming out into a windy sky.<span>  </span>Jenny left me in her bedroom, confused by my unwillingness to play, and I quietly ripped the tail off a stuffed squirrel near her bed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">That night, my mother tucked me in.<span>  </span>I tried to tell her about it, that I didn’t feel well, that I’d ripped Jenny’s toy squirrel and hidden it in a closet.<span>  </span>“You’ll survive, sweetie,” she said, and patted my head.<span>  </span>I wasn’t even finished talking when she called me a trooper and left the room.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">It began again, the feeling of being a bell in a big wind.<span>  </span>I waited until I heard her close the door to her bathroom, turn on the faucet, open a drawer.<span>  </span>The tile was cold under my feet.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“What’s wrong?” she asked.<span>  </span>Her mouth was bare of lipstick, flecked with the faintest white toothpaste.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I could have said that I missed her.<span>  </span>That I missed my dad. That every penny I threw into the well at the mall was about them, about having them back.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">But instead, I twisted my hands together.<span>  </span>I said that Derrick came into my room at night.<span>  </span>I watched her face contract, then loosen into a surface as smooth as a plate.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“What?” she asked.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“He touches himself,” I said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">My mother knelt down, staring into my eyes.<span>  </span>“Are you telling me the truth?” she asked.<span>  </span>I could have burst into tears, admitted my lie. I nodded.<span>  </span>She tucked my hair away from my cheek.<span>  </span>“Did he touch you?” she asked, her voice a strong whisper.<span>  </span>I shook my head.<span>  </span>She kept her hand on my cheek.<span>  </span>She closed her eyes.<span>  </span>Then she reached out and pulled me to her, smoothing the back of my head.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“I’m sorry,” she said, finally.<span>  </span>“I’m sorry.<span>  </span>Sometimes people go through things inside that they don’t show everyone.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">She walked me to bed and held my hand and the heat from it seemed to shoot directly into my face.<span>  </span>“I didn’t know,” she whispered.<span>  </span>“I didn’t know.”<span>  </span>I knew she was crying, though I’d shut my eyes so tightly, the silver eyespots swarmed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Derrick was gone that afternoon.<span>  </span>Drawers and closet empty, borrowed bed turned on its side.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">My mother returned to me.<span>  </span>I got her back.<span>  </span>She never fostered another child.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">What did Derrick think when my mother drove him back to the social worker?<span>  </span>Left him there with his duffel and an envelope of money?<span>  </span>I don’t know if my mother explained her reasons, or if she simply said she wasn’t cut out for raising other people’s kids.<span>  </span>In twenty-four years, we’ve never uttered his name—as if we can make him disappear from our past.<span>  </span>As if by acting like the world can’t hurt us, we will make it so.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I’m still in the car.<span>  </span>A roll of thunder, then a clap.<span>  </span>The noise happens once in the sky, then silently with feeling through the earth. I open the door, stand in the cool wind.<span>  </span>I didn’t bring a raincoat and within seconds, the shoulders of my shirt are soaked through.<span>  </span>Cliff’s hair is flat against his skull.<span>  </span>He looks out into the gray and red, into the yellow and silver.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span> </span>The rain is loud, falling against the wood, the dirt, the trees, my face.<span>  </span>When drops hit the dusty trail, they stay risen like tiny bunkers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Cliff’s walking away from me, down into the trees.<span>  </span>His body’s small against the bleak view of peaks and I feel a wash of gratitude—for him, for the air and trees.<span>  </span>A clump of leaves lands near my foot, layers of yellow and brown.<span>  </span>I grab a handful and squeeze.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The truth is, if I had one wish right now, if I could wish on a handful of leaves—for baby Josephina, eternal life, eternal youth, domestic peace, a love that would never stray from me, never end—well, I’ve listened closely.<span>  </span>I know what happens.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span> </span>I wouldn’t wish for anything at all.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I drop the leaves and lock the door.<span>  </span>Cliff gets smaller and smaller.<span>  </span>And then I follow him down the dust paths turning to mud, into the brown, silver and yellow, into the crashing storm.<span>  </span></p>

<p>If I’m not a bear, thought the bear&#8211;<br />
and wistfulness rose in him, <em>maybe<br />
he was a falcon, a redwood, a slug,<br />
a raccoon</em>&#8211;but then his bear brain<br />
made him look down at his chest and belly,<br />
and what he saw&#8211;his furry paunch,<br />
the queer white of his skin, a tick<br />
so full of bear blood it would soon<br />
drop off&#8211;was like a boulder blocking<br />
the path of his thinking.<span>  </span><em>A soft<br />
little spring breeze, he thought, why<br />
couldn’t I be the high meadow full<br />
of quarrelsome bobolinks who nip<br />
the little yellow moths from the air<br />
when they’re hungry?<span>  </span>Why couldn’t I…?</em><br />
but suddenly such mental bearfoolery<br />
sickened him into standing humanlike<br />
to bam his ribcage with his front legs,<br />
and to angrily stomp (though he hated<br />
when he split infinitives) Lady Fern,<br />
Guelder Rose, and Carpet Moss until<br />
he’d dampened his lower paws with black-<br />
green juice, conjured a rich forest dirt<br />
and vegetable stink to waft upward.<span>  </span>Oh,<br />
that was when the bear got it straight,<br />
not just the news of his irrevocable<br />
bearness and the piss-ant misery<br />
of a bear’s lot but also on the other<br />
hand the luck of his snout, his tongue,<br />
his penis and balls, his improbable speed,<br />
his forever hidden-from-himself asshole,<br />
his being no other creature or thing<br />
than the bear that he was, an aging<br />
and otherwise unremarkable eastern<br />
black bear.<span>  </span>He was never to be a brown<br />
trout married to icy water and speckled<br />
slithering among stones, nor could he be<br />
the red-tailed hawk whose killing ways<br />
were, to the bear in his picture of it<br />
right then&#8211;death falling from the sky&#8211;<br />
so merciless, clean, and righteous.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/02/hike-to-the-black-madonna.mp3">Hike to the Black Madonna</a></p>
<p>The aching muscles of my calves began to tremble just as the forest broke away. A white river threaded the valley floor far below. I turned to the right and above the tips of pine emerged the Sümela Monastery. This windowed building of six stories—seamlessly carved out of sheer rock—opened to the sky, its arched doorways shrouded in cloud I had perceived as mist from far below.</p>
<p>In 1930, a fire gutted the library, guest rooms, courtyards, church, and monk housing. It was only seven years after the new Turkish government relocated local Orthodox Greeks to Greece. Among the skeletal wall-remains, 1200 meters above sea level, tourists appeared and disappeared; secured to their heads were hardhats the color of lemons, an illusion of safety amid falling rock and slippery walkways.</p>
<p>The clash of the mountain panorama and cliff-side building amplified as I walked among the monastery’s dissolving walls. Graffiti-carved names—Nurten, Yavir, and Nebile—looked like words of prayer. On the interiors of some walls, sun and wind peeled the paint off frescoes even as I studied them. Cut out sections revealed layers of plaster over rough stone. Vandals gouged out saints’ eyes on paintings within arm’s reach. In one, too high for violence, the hand of Jesus compelled Lazarus’s body from an open tomb. And was this Mary, head halo-wrapped, body cloaked in red? At her center, the infant Jesus holding his arms out in blessing. The walls of my childhood church seemed to rise up, and I felt awe just as I did praying before the fourth station of the cross, the priest’s words <em>Jesus meets his mother</em> in my ears.</p>
<p>I stood within these stories overwhelmed by an interior of debris: desire, conception, death, and resurrection held together in stone even as that stone decayed. How was I to know then that the icon—the Black Madonna—serene in her wall niche, was missing? Mary and I gazed at each other with serious eyes, and I searched through a jumble of stories, time and space blurring—a choice to look for the woman inside.</p>
<p align="center">* * *</p>
<p>Trabzon: our school’s-out destination. Neither Chad, my boyfriend, nor I had traipsed across northeastern Turkey yet. With my two-year teaching stint in Tarsus complete, I planned to unwind from an exhausting semester before returning to the States for graduate school. Only halfway through his contract, Chad would be back in Turkey in August. I hoped our time alone would strengthen our relationship before the “long distance” phase.</p>
<p>We walked across tarmac toward a twenty-seater airplane, scarlet-lettered <em>Bodrum</em> emblazoned upon its white paint. A colleague of ours nicknamed Bodrum “Bed Room:” a place to swim, barhop, and seduce tourists. A rather sinful city.</p>
<p>“That’s hilarious. We’re flying to Trabzon in the <em>Bodrum</em>,” I said to Chad, reaching for his hand. “It’s like flying to Las Vegas in the <em>Chastity</em>. Instead of beaches and bars, we’ll be touring Orthodox churches.”</p>
<p>He smiled and slung his arm around my backpack.</p>
<p>I pictured the Sümela monastery, named for a Greek word stemming from “dark” or “black.” Later I would learn about the Black Madonna icon and ponder the incongruity of her slender, European nose and thin lips with her black hair and dark skin. Like all Black Madonnas, her contrasting features inspired conjecture. Centuries of stories, deposited within the vessel of Mary’s body, shifted over time.</p>
<p>Chad sighed and stretched out, staring at the seatback in front of him. I read this as preoccupation, as invitation to initiate conversation. Nearby a passenger shoved a duffel bag into an overhead bin; others squeezed themselves between armrests. I pulled out the seat belt and buckled it across my waist.</p>
<p>“Hey. I’m sure I’m not,” I said to Chad. “I shouldn’t have mentioned I was late until I knew for sure. But if you keep being worried, you’ll make me worried.” I tried to catch his eye.</p>
<p>“We’re always safe, but you said you’re never this late.” Did he think I was lying? “Let’s not talk about this right now.” He pulled out a book from his bag.</p>
<p>The flight attendant’s ring glinted as she set the tea down on the mini-tray on my lap. I plunked a sugar cube into my glass, a tiny vase curved like a woman’s body. The grains of sugar broke free and floated up before merging into the steaming sienna tea. One of my hands drifted to my flat belly, the other to the rim of the glass.</p>
<p>“It’s probably stress,” I said. “If I don’t obsess about it, it’ll come. Besides, this is our <em>vacation</em>. Just the two of us.”</p>
<p>His answer: a squeeze of my hand before opening the book.</p>
<p>I interpreted this as affirmation. As I sipped the hot tea my mind turned the kaleidoscope of possibilities. A half-inch twist changed the geometric slips of paper—me, Chad, school, one year’s time—from a mandala of jewels into an aqua and russet burst, one version of the story. Another? Twelve years of Catholic school burned The Visitation behind my eyes. I imagine Mary’s hair as the color of walnuts. Cooking lamb, she tucks a stray curl under her hair covering and lapses into a daydream about a cute neighbor. Gabriel drops by; her kaleidoscope turns.</p>
<p>“God’s tapped you,” the angel explains. “What do you say?” She’s given a choice and thinks about it, but scripture doesn’t convey silence well. Her “yes” inverts the shape of her future. She could’ve said no.</p>
<p>Minus the angel and miraculous conception, I thought when faced with pregnancy, I’d watch mirrors and light blur the colors before me. I’d search for an answer within.</p>
<p align="center">* * *</p>
<p>With no summit of the Zigana Mountains to inspire us yet, Chad and I trekked the path snaking through the forest. The saturated air infused each deep breath with the scent of pine and slowed my pace. Tight from travel, my muscles strained to push, and I negotiated the curves of the steep ascension with care. Chad’s muscles, remembering thousands of bouldering hikes, propelled him with ease, yet sweat trickled down his neck. After an hour, my t-shirt and jeans stuck to my skin; I wished I had braved shorts despite the stares of disapproval I’d receive. The narrowed eyes of men always conjured fragments of a memory: a man’s hand on my shoulder; a wall closing in; my fingers squeezing his throat; his feet hitting pavement. I still breathed through the anger and fear summoned by memories of this attempted attack. With my blonde hair and blue eyes, had he assumed I was a “Natasha”—a Russian sex worker?</p>
<p>Our steps regularized as the forest thickened, the canopy of leaves shielding us from direct sun. Partway up, Chad and I veered off the main trail and followed an overgrown dirt path. It ended at ruins. We rested on a chunk of stone and sipped from water bottles. The smell of the crumbling house—two partial walls and pile of stacked rubble—was a blend of mold and piss. Perhaps this dwelling had once sheltered pilgrims seeking Sümela’s sacred springs. According to legend, the Black Madonna asked angels to remove her icon from Athens where Saint Luke had sent his painting. Mary chose this mountain and she created a place of healing.</p>
<p>Back on the dusty trail, I focused on my walking sandals, one step in front of the other. Every few minutes I caught a glimpse of a brown trunk swathed in moss or a branch veiled in leaves of translucent green, each leaf a halo of light.</p>
<p align="center">* * *</p>
<p>Chad and I had trouble finding a hotel in Trabzon. On the outside we were tourists—good business—but once hotel clerks opened our Turkish work permits (they designated our status as teachers which often meant cheaper prices) and studied the inside, they read a different story. The permit marked us “single,” but we asked for one room. They scrutinized me, listening to my clumsy Turkish. “No vacancy,” they finally said, snapping the permits shut.</p>
<p>I doubted them. The number of Natashas in Trabzon reinforced their stereotypes of non-Turkish women. I had become accustomed to, although never comfortable with, Turkish men glancing at my short blonde hair and blue eyes and asking me for sex. Walking home from the market, a sack of tomatoes and carrots in my arms, I would pass a small group of men leaning against a wall and smoking cigarettes. Avoiding eye contact that might “invite” a remark, I stared at the back of women’s tight ponytails or fringed headscarves. I imagine one of the smokers noticed my hair first. He probably elbowed his friend. Taking a drag of his cigarette, he would exhale: “Hello, Natasha” followed by a flurry of Turkish. The first month I blushed; the second I glared even though it amused them. When their “Hey, Natasha, Natasha” faded, my neck relaxed, shoulders softened, and pace slowed. I marched faster if one followed me for several blocks. I tried to ignore the ways men interpreted my exterior, the stories they assumed from the color of my hair and eyes.</p>
<p>We secured a hotel room after two proprietors refused us. Nestled among a series of red-shingled businesses, Hotel Nur topped a deeply sloping street. Two steep flights of stairs ended with our room. Once inside the door, Chad took four steps and stood in front of a nightstand between twin beds. The angle of light, streaming from a window, illuminated the thickness of his body, corded muscles from rock climbing softened by slight cushioning—the result of his own great cooking. I dropped my backpack on the right bed and pushed open the only other door. The closet-sized bathroom was just the right size for a saint’s niche. I could imagine Mary Magdalene—from a fresco featured in my guidebook—smoothing out her hair in the mirror. Her elongated fingers and neck, pale cheeks, and somber expression created a version of this woman I didn’t recognize; I always imagined her as curvy, a bit plump even, with knowing eyes, thick, loose hair, and a slight smile on her lips.</p>
<p>Only my head reflected in the mirror above the basin as I washed my hands and face. When I opened the door, Chad stood there, a pregnancy test in his hand.</p>
<p>“Where’d you get this?” I asked, touching the corner of the box.</p>
<p>“Lisa had one and gave it to me before we left.”</p>
<p>My hand recoiled. “You told her?” I wondered how many other friends knew about this possibility.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well I was worried that you’d be worried.”</p>
<p>“I’m not,” I replied, folding my arms in front of me.</p>
<p align="center">* * *</p>
<p>I put off the test by suggesting dinner. At the restaurant a case of fresh <em>alabalık</em> laid out on crushed ice greeted us, reminding me of my father’s autumn catches of trout in the cold streams of northern Iowa. We pointed to two we wanted and ordered tomato and cucumber salad, pita, and lentil soup. I placed a napkin over the head of my fish; its blank, watching eye bothered me as I separated meat from bones. Chad chatted about his plans to leave in three days for the States. I would travel alone for another week before meeting a friend in Istanbul and sightseeing for two weeks with her.</p>
<p>“Do you have to go back this week? Maybe you could change your departure date and go back when I meet Melissa.”</p>
<p>“That would be impossible. I’ve been planning a summer of mountain-climbing and beer-drinking for months.”</p>
<p>I don’t remember the rest of our conversation or if there was one.</p>
<p>When we returned to Hotel Nur, an actual Natasha—the first I’d seen—lingered a few doors down from the entrance. Her body was lean, all angles, especially the way her knees jutted out of her orange mini skirt. The only curve I could see was the curl of her bobbed platinum hair.</p>
<p>Chad insisted on the test. The sun made the burnt-red rooftops shimmer as I turned from him and stepped into the bathroom. His way, I figured, would produce an answer. Clarify things. I eased onto my haunches and balanced over a porcelain hole with cup in hand. Through the crack in the door I heard the call to prayer, and afterwards, a Russian voice arguing with someone on the street below our room.</p>
<p>When Mary Magdalene crashed Jesus’ dinner party, he recognized a fellow healer, one who could soothe with her caress. He touched her chin as she perfumed his feet with oil and turned her face up to his. “Things change,” he said when they were eye to eye. “Come with me. I’ll never leave you alone.”  The next day I would see a fresco of Mary Magdalene with regret painted in her eyes.  She would appear to weep into my hair from the ceiling.</p>
<p>I peed, then handed Chad the stick still wet with urine.</p>
<p align="center">* * *</p>
<p>I wish I could say I saw Sümela’s Black Madonna when I explored the monastery, but her image painted on cracked black wood and framed in eighteenth-century silver metalwork had disappeared. Maybe she resembled Our Lady of Jasna Gora: almond-shaped eyes half closed; a svelte nose lengthening her oval face; complexion the color of coffee with cream; a halo setting off the gold borders of her headpiece. Would her image have inspired me to wash my hands in her sacred spring or put the water to my lips? Perhaps I would have felt a sudden lift of spirit, a tingling from head to toe. I would have been able to step back from my life and trust everything would turn out okay.</p>
<p>Instead, I found stories of Black Madonnas long after my relationship with Chad was over. Two days after the hike, backpack slung over his arm, he climbed onto the airport bus. I waited for him to turn around, to change his mind. His bus roared away, the tires churning up a cloud of dust. On the outside our relationship wasn’t over—and wouldn’t be for another year—but on some level we’d both abandoned it.</p>
<p>I traveled west along the Black Sea following a route the spiritual descendants of Barnabus and Sophronius, the hermits credited with bringing Sümela’s Black Madonna to Anatolia. After the monastery was founded, the two traveled throughout Anatolia, the Balkans, and Russia to sell copies of their famous icon. In Sinop I said a prayer at St. Anne’s, the church of Mary’s mother, whose image time had transformed into a winged figure without a face. Alone in Safronbolu, I rambled into quiet neighborhoods where I watched women hang rugs on clotheslines and sweep stone steps.  Sometimes I stood on the side of a street to watch people sauntering by, worries or hope mapped on their faces. The breeze orchestrated their voices into a medley, tuning into my heartbeat, and I dissolved into the current for a moment.</p>
<p>Some scholars conjecture that artists darkened Mary’s image to illustrate a text from the Song of Songs: “I am black and beautiful;” others associate Black Madonnas with ancient earth goddesses; others say they express a feminine power not fully conveyed by a pale-skinned Mary and link them to Mary Magdalene. Perhaps the painter never intended her to be a “Black Madonna” and soot from centuries of burning candles turned her pigment dark. Perhaps she ended up so many miles from home by accident, a wrinkle in her predestined story. Perhaps she felt obliged to say yes. Perhaps the ways men looked at her fueled her desire to seek shelter—any shelter.</p>
<p>Sümela’s Black Madonna never appeared to me on that hike. She was gone. Or she was everywhere. Inside the monastery, hues of paintings lightened only to be darkened again by shadows of passing clouds. Stones crumbled underfoot—the possibilities in narratives conceived. And that interior debris, what’s left of desire, shifted. I wonder if Mary would choose, as I have, the stories that sustain her. I wonder if she would exist, as I have, in the spaces that they blur.</p>

<span>Here, where I am buffeted,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;barely able to stand,<br />
a kestrel hangs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;impossibly still in the wind.<br />
I envy its otherness,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its look of being somewhere else—</span></p>
<p>far from where I’ve scrabbled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up the slope, unloosening scree<br />
as I climbed, lacking altogether<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the grace of this hawk<br />
becalmed in mid air.  <em>Becalmed</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;despite gusts strong enough<br />
to rend a sail in the firth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that blue hem<br />
at the end of these hills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want down.<br />
Without tripping over moles<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tunneling their runways<br />
under my feet. Sheep, stones, shrew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;half-hidden in the upland grasses—<br />
all of us tilting toward sea level,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exposed as the skylark<br />
and golden plover that veer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the airspace between Scald Law<br />
and the kestrel’s barely quivering wings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a recurring dream<br />
I have of hovering, the calm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call kestrel in this storm.<br />
Waking I know even the bird’s lift<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is short-lived. The hair’s-breadth<br />
between heather and heath,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those seconds before it plunges<br />
headlong into a vole.</p>

<p>The male tweezes a bald millet stalk<br />
off a sahara of graveled paper.</p>
<p>The pert watch movements of his head<br />
ignite a ember on each cheek, buff bright</p>
<p>the beak’s rose hip hue. His elderberry eye<br />
subjects this meter cubed of universe</p>
<p>to further scrutiny. The struggles of<br />
a downy filament attract him.</p>
<p>With these two finds he alights, caresses<br />
the injection-molded branch. But there is</p>
<p>no flaw to catch on, no way to make a start.<br />
A problem he sets aside for the moment,</p>
<p>pinning it down with his foot. In the dusky<br />
corner his mate dangles off brass wires,</p>
<p>mobile as a chandelier earring.<br />
Extending her wing, she makes him</p>
<p>more to find, fussing<br />
a small snow from the hot and pearly hollow.</p>

This is the time of day we hear them coming back,<br />
when the first sunlight drops to the field<br />
like an animal being born, slick and shivering<br />
where it falls.  Their hooves grind against the earth,<br />
wheat pounded in a mortar<br />
with a pestle, freed from its husks and impurities.<br />
What wickedness clings to me, it sticks<br />
to the last.  I will keep my mouth with a bridle.</p>
