								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>A Face to Meet the Faces: An Anthology of Contemporary Persona Poetry</em><br />
edited by Stacey Lynn Brown and Oliver de la Paz (Akron, 2012)</p>
<p>by Nick Ripatrazone</p>
<p>Dislocated Identities, Found Personas<br />
Edward Hirsch notes that persona poetry originates “in archaic rituals where masks are independent beings that possess the ones who assume them,” resulting in the animistic “displacement of the poet’s self into another existence, a second self.” Hirsch quotes W.B. Yeats that the poet “never speaks directly as to someone at the breakfast table, there is always a phantasmagoria.” Each poetic or imaginative act is a form of persona, but persona poetry is the acknowledgment of disruption of the self’s shape, like a phantasmagoric, lantern-projected image onto an uneven rock wall.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/10/face-to-meet.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-797" title="face to meet" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/10/face-to-meet.jpeg" alt="" width="172" height="264" /></a>A Face to Meet the Faces</em> offers nearly 500 pages of persona poems arranged by both content and theme. Sections include historical figures, characters from mythology, folklore, popular culture, religious figures, fairy tales and other imaginative literature, as well as adoptions of the voices of poets and fiction writers. The editors have compiled a generous sampling of both established and emerging voices. Blas Falconer documents Diego Salcedo’s 16th century murder that preceded the Taíno rebellion. Tony Trigilio channels Lee Harvey Oswald’s confession to his father. Kazim Ali renews the Icarus myth. Jericho Brown performs as Diana Ross in “Track 4: Reflections.” Cornelius Eady elegizes Emmett Till through the young man’s glass-top casket. Patricia Smith braves the hate of a skinhead who has “my own beauty.” Susan Rich’s midrashic “Sarah’s Story” compliments the treatment of Isaac by William Robert Flowers. Philip Memmer shares a new magician’s assistant hopes to better her predecessors who have worn “the same short sequined dress.”  The collection spans moments of seriousness and absurdity, all glued by the transformative act of persona.</p>
<p>Three particular poems represent the breadth and depth of the collection. John Canaday’s “Robert Oppenheimer Near Los Alamos, October 1945” is a sensitive refiguring of Oppenheimer’s persona. Though the paradoxes of Oppenheimer’s personality are well known, his literary leanings are worthy of further investigation. “Robert Oppenheimer” makes no direct mention of the bomb, but for good reason: it postdates the Trinity test, the August bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and instead returns to Oppenheimer’s self-professed true loves, “physics and desert country.”</p>
<p>The poem is narrated by a group “urging their horses forward, watching ribbons / of steam rise from their flanks.” In the only metaphorical reference to the structures of Los Alamos, “Crises’ steel shoes sang / on the sandstone outcrops.” Moonlight is found “down by the river,” where “the boatman slept in an old alder shack / between two palms.” Though the boatman is unnamed, the postwar context, along with Oppenheimer’s poetic self-awareness of his role in the machinations of death, intimates Charon. Here Canaday revises the language of Oppenheimer’s own poem, “Crossing,” written at Harvard. Oppenheimer’s poetry induced Paul Dirac’s infamous jab: “I understand that you are writing poetry as well as working at physics. I do not see how you can do both. In science we say something that no one knew before in a way that everybody can understand. Whereas in poetry . . . ”</p>
<p>The poems of Oppenheimer and Canaday share content: several men on horseback crossing a river, a moon lost behind mountains. Phrases are nearly replicated: Oppenheimer’s “ranges barring the sky” has become “High slopes / barring the sky.” Yet Canaday’s divergence from Oppenheimer’s original poem creates a successful work of persona. Oppenheimer’s poem was written long before the reality of the Manhattan Project, and could be set anywhere in the Southwest. Canaday’s version is set on the Rio Grande, so that the riders see their boatman in the shadow of the bomb’s development. Oppenheimer’s boatman “called to us”; Canaday’s boatman sleeps. It is the riders, not the boatman, who “called farewell,” and only the “tamarisks replied” with “salty breath” before their “dry leaves . . . flickered like candles / and went out.” A soft ending to a poem about a man instrumental in developing a most dangerous weapon.</p>
<p><em>A Face to Meet the Faces</em> moves beyond refiguring historical personas to contemporary poets adopting past voices. Matthew Nienow’s “Walt Whitman Sings Happy Birthday to Himself” works well. In the preface to the 1855 version of Leaves of Grass, Whitman nearly contemplates such persona attention: “The greatest poet forms the consistence of what is to be from what has been and is. He drags the dead out of their coffins and stands them again on their feet.”</p>
<p>The 25-line poem is one sentence. Commas nudge the narrative forward, but the form never feels convoluted. Nienow resists the urge to elevate Whitman. The poem begins “Down the uneven plank stairs, down to the cellar-world” choked by “thick smoke.” There, “the low rumble of a hundred men” become one, joined by Whitman. They all “have come here, to celebrate / or curse the fact of our being here.” Though Nienow indulges, like Whitman, in “myself,” the personal reflexive is tempered: myself “is also to drink to you / for we are of the same flesh and must sing to say so.” Whitman, after “the long night among other men, smelling / still of smoke and earth,” returns to the now quiet city to “sing myself another year in this lingering body.”</p>
<p>Visitors to Whitman’s 1891 birthday celebration included the painter Thomas Eakins, who, speaking of painting Whitman, said “ordinary methods” were insufficient; “technique, rules, and traditions would have to be thrown aside; that, before all else, he was to be treated as a man.” Whitman’s confidence and voice threatens to burst through Nienow’s own words.</p>
<p>Not bound to the real, <em>A Face to Meet the Faces</em> also offers fictional personas. “Pinocchio’s Elegy for the Unreal” by Ariana-Sophia Kartsonis offers a continuation of Carlo Collodi’s serialized novel. In the novel, still-marionette Pinocchio is chased by assassins, and seeks refuge in the house of a “lovely maiden” who claims she is already dead, simply “waiting for the coffin to take me away.” Once Pinocchio is captured the narrative turns from sardonic to violent: the marionette is lynched, but as an unreal child, death is not possible. Pinocchio is taken down and wrapped in sheets. One of the doctors summoned, the Talking Cricket, calls Pinocchio “a rascal of the worst kind . . . rude, lazy, a runaway,” but he survives.<br />
Collodi’s novel ends with Pinocchio’s strange transformation into a boy: his wooden form is “leaning against a chair, head turned to one side, arms hanging limp, and legs twisted under him.” So the gift of life is one of displacement, the passing away of an old body. Collodi ends the novel abruptly, and the story begs continuation. Kartsonis offers the next act with Collodi’s wit. Geppetto, “who once pulled my strings, / knit the motion to my dance, tied to me / somewhere inside even now” is “deep in the sleep of death.” Now “you’re on your own.”</p>
<p>The speaker misses “the certainty of my ligneous hands” and that a “torn finger can’t be carved anew.” Unfortunately, with humanity comes mortality: “I wish you’d told me about the way it feels / to be watching life from a dying body.” The poem evolves from sarcasm to a concerted lament, as the speaker longs for moments of the unreal, since he “can still hear the toys talk, still hear the whispers / of the inanimate world, the soul of objects.”<br />
The poem ends with a return to Geppetto’s workshop, where “every old tool dreams of your hands, / your smoothing grip.” There, “veiled with cobwebs,” a spider “unlaces a luna moth, a dinner / too huge, too gossamer to be real.” In these final lines, the poem and novel coalesce, reaching another layer of story. Such conversation between poem, precedent, persona, and variations might be the best result of A Face to Meet the Faces, and of the persona act.</p>
<p>Donald Hall finds possible “dangers” in persona poetry, exampling the work of TS Eliot and James Dickey. In “The Self as Agent,” Dickey explains that each poem “is both an exploration and an invention of identity.” All poetry, for Dickey, is fiction, so critics should not expect autobiography or consistency of personality across works. For Dickey, a poet’s worth is synonymous with multiplicity of personality. Persona “gives the poet a chance to confront and dramatize parts of himself that otherwise would not have surfaced.”<br />
Hall posits that Dickey’s usage of persona might be an act of poetic cowardice, saying “we want him to try to find out what it means in his own life.” He finds that Dickey “does not accept the risk of his search . . . Instead, he uses a persona as a way out.” Such criticism might be valid in a particular, political realm, but the act of persona poetry is not the avoidance of the “I,” it is an acceptance and qualification of the “we.” Empathy&#8211;poetic or otherwise&#8211;is not easy, and the dramatic monologues of persona poetry offer valuable experiences for both reader and writer. Distortion of truth and identity is good for the breakfast table, as well as the page.</p>

<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/05/Komunyakaa-Review.mp3">Komunyakaa Review</a></p>
<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/05/yusef1.jpeg"><img src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/05/yusef1.jpeg" alt="" title="yusef" width="132" height="198" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-670" /></a><strong>Erudition as Disguise</strong></p>
<p>On occasion, an eager and adept reader happens upon a poetry collection that satisfies immediately. The lyric intensity of individual poems may carry the volume, or the narrative arc may be so compelling and taut that the reader shelves the collection knowing where the journey has taken her and that she’s been accompanied by a reliable guide.  <em>The Chameleon Couch</em> is not one of those collections.  In this, his eighteenth volume of poems, Yusef Komunyakaa employs a nearly overpowering display of erudition, a seemingly boundless range of historical and cultural referents, and a facility for metaphor and image, all of which combine both to dazzle and befuddle the reader.  Only a very small audience should approach <em>The Chameleon Couch</em> without a powerful search engine and adequate time for more than one reading.  The poems, however, ultimately justify the effort required to comprehend Komunyakaa’s purpose and how he goes about achieving it.</p>
<p>Frost suggested that a volume of poetry should be constructed well enough to serve as its own concluding poem. Most collections fall short on that count, but <em>The Chameleon Couch</em> is an exception. Recurring images link the three untitled sections, but the second section exhibits a thematic unity not evidenced in the first and third portions of the book.  Of the sixteen poems in the middle section, at least ten allude to, or explicitly refer to, war or combat. This is not a re-tilling of ground already plowed in <em>Dien Cai Dau</em>, although readers familiar with Komunyakaa’s biography and poems about his Viet Nam experiences may not be able to avoid making a connection.  What is striking in these war poems is Komunyakaa’s ability and willingness to focus relentlessly on the topic and yet do so in ways that remain fresh and surprising.</p>
<p>In the ekphrastic “Three Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion,” Komunyakaa explores a triptych painted by Francis Bacon.  War is never mentioned explicitly, but other horrors are:</p>
<blockquote><p>Did the painter ascend a dogwood<br />
or crawl into the hold of a slave ship<br />
to get a good view of the thing<br />
turning itself inside out beneath<br />
a century of interrogation lamps?</p></blockquote>
<p>The references to the crucifixion of Jesus (the dogwood legend), the slave trade, and torture convey with abundant clarity a tone of dread.  The poem requires no further investigation; but, as is the case often in <em>The Chameleon Couch</em>, a little mining yields treasure.  Here, a few clicks of the mouse will reveal that Bacon painted this bizarre and troubling work in 1944 at the height of World War II.  The poem’s images suddenly bear additional weight.  Komunyakaa then ends the poem with three of the most memorable lines in the entire collection, exhibiting both this poet’s mastery of image and his view that alienation, estrangement, and struggle are the critical markers of humankind’s existential situation—a perspective that permeates <em>The Chameleon Couch</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A twisted globe of flesh<br />
is held together by what<br />
it pushes against.</p></blockquote>
<p>The second section displays also Komunyakaa’s familiarity with Greek mythology and his ability to employ it in a way that, for the curious, motivated reader, adds additional texture to the poems.  In “Orpheus at the Second Gate of Hades,” the speaker is determined to make his second visit to the underworld despite unsettling recollections of the first visit – Furies, Tantalus, Tityus, Ixion, Sisyphus, Proserpine, and King Pluto.  Readers may be tempted to acknowledge Komunyakaa’s erudition and move on, shamed briefly by their familiarity only with the poet’s more contemporary allusions.  But that would be a mistake.  Poems like this one—and there are plenty here – require deliberate and resourceful reading.  The reader who is acquainted, or willing to become acquainted, with Greek mythology will be rewarded when the poem turns at line 41 to the speaker’s compulsion to speak of what he had seen:</p>
<blockquote><p>I saw a stall filled with human things, an endless<br />
list of names, a hill of shoes, a room of suitcases<br />
tagged to nowhere, eyeglasses, toothbrushes,<br />
baby shoes, dentures, ads for holiday spas,<br />
&amp; a wide roll of thick cloth woven of living hair.</p></blockquote>
<p>The interlocking of mythical suffering with the list of the spoils of a Nazi death camp demands the reader’s attention and genuine appreciation not only for the poet’s virtuosity but also for his deep humanity.  Making this poem—one of the collection’s most emotionally compelling—even more notable is Komunyakaa’s insertion of one of the few overtly humorous notes in the entire book.  Immediately prior to the speaker’s gruesome inventory, he hints at trouble getting through the gate:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . I don’t remember<br />
exactly what I said at the ticket office<br />
my first visit here, but I do know it grew<br />
ugly.  The classical allusions didn’t<br />
make it any easier. . . .</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the poems in the second section that does not address warfare explicitly offers another glimpse of the array of Komunyakaa’s cultural resources.  The immediate setting of “Blackbirding On the Hudson” is Czestochowa, Poland, where the speaker is reminded of the Hudson River when he pulls from the shelf a volume of poetry and opens it to Robert Lowell’s “The Mouth of the Hudson.”  The speaker recalls specific images from the Lowell poem, the “coke fumes &amp; the chemical air of / New Jersey.”  The Hudson’s flow and Lowell’s solitary figure, standing as if admiring the birds, calls to the speaker’s mind “another phrase—I think it is ‘blackbirding’— / pecking fiercely / at my gut.”  Besides echoing the vulture poised to tear at Tityus’s liver in “Orpheus at the Second Gate of Hades,” these lines mark a turn toward a complex reflection on the slave trade, the river’s permanent indifference in the face of its own despoliation, and the mood set by Thelonius Monk’s rendition of “Coming on the Hudson.”  As jarringly impressive as this plenitude of resources is, the reader will at some point in her reading ask whether Komunyakaa’s willingness to display his virtuosity with such abandon is a distraction and, if it is, whether that effect is intentional.  Before engaging that larger question, however, a brief look at poems in the first and third sections of the book is in order.</p>
<p>Although the first section of <em>The Chameleon Couch</em> is a looser thematic unit than section two, the poems here do share images and concerns that both permeate the entire collection and organize this portion of the book.  As with much of Komunyakaa’s poetry, music is a constant.  Expected allusions and explicit references to blues and jazz music and personalities appear in “Black Figs” and “Ignis Fatuus.”  More unusual is the poet’s meditation on a Japanese bamboo flute in “Ode to the Shakuhachi.”  That poem exemplifies the demands this collection places on the reader.  Komunyakaa’s reference to a famous piece composed for Shakuhachi, “The Sound of Deer Calling to One Another,” is not essential to the poem but invites the curious reader to investigate.  Perhaps it deepens subsequent approaches to the poem, but sometimes a distraction is just a distraction.</p>
<p>The volume’s opening poem, “Canticle,” forecasts the musical theme and puts the reader on notice that, although the poet will provide points of access, the trail will not always be well-marked.  Before shifting abruptly to a present tense East Village scene, one finds this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . Seasons sprouted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; went to seed as we circled the dance with silver cat bells<br />
tied to our feet.  Now, kissing you, I am the archheir of second<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chances.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because I know twelve ways to be wrong<br />
&amp; two to be good, I was wounded by the final question in the cave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; left side of the spirit level’s quiver.  I didn’t want to hug you<br />
into a cross, but I’m here to be measured down to each numbered<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bone.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A trembling runs through what pulls us to the blood knot.</p></blockquote>
<p>More hospitable—and thematically indicative of the collection as a whole—is another poem ostensibly related to Komunyakaa’s musical interests, “The One-Handed Concerto.”  The poet uses Ravel’s commissioned composition of the “Piano Concerto for the Left Hand” for Paul Wittgenstein, Ludwig’s older brother, to discuss absence, loss, and alienation.  Present at the same time is an instant of humor which, unfortunately, occurs too infrequently in this volume.  Both are at play when the poet reflects on the pianist’s war injury:</p>
<blockquote><p>Perhaps he could even forget &amp; snap<br />
the fingers of his lost hand to call his dog home,<br />
&amp; it would come running full trot, wagging its tail.<br />
But he didn’t know if he’d ever learn to play absence,<br />
because he could cover only one ear.</p></blockquote>
<p>Komunyakaa also includes in the first section what is arguably one of his best poems addressing racial oppression.  In “Cape Coast Castle,” the image of the slave trade center in Ghana before its relocation in 1877 follows the speaker and his lover from western Africa to Amsterdam and is pushed aside only by the ghost of his mother, and then only temporarily.  In a passage that, oddly enough, calls to mind the speaker’s realization in James Dickey’s “Slave Quarters” “that there is no hatred / Like love in the eyes / Of a wholly owned face . . . ,” Komunyakaa describes the “governor,” his selection of a slave woman to be brought to his rooms, and his approach to subjugating a race:  “There’s a whole tribe in this one, but I’ll break them / before they’re in the womb, before they’re conceived, / before they’re even thought of.”  Aside from the horror so effectively conveyed in this poem, the appearance of the ghost should not be overlooked.  It is one of at least seven references to ghosts in <em>The Chameleon Couch</em>.  Along with even more frequent invocations of the mask image and repeated references to shadows and labyrinths, Komunyakaa is hinting at the collection’s estrangement motif.  Images of impermanence and disguise abound in this first section.  With the ephemeral swamp gas in “Ignis Fatuus,” the “shape shifter” in “Ode to the Chameleon,” and the devil fish, makeup, sunglasses, and bleaching cream in “Ten or Eleven Disguises,” the poet is laying the foundation for a construct that is only visible in its entirety after the reader reflects upon the collection.</p>
<p>The third section of the book, by far the longest, is the least satisfying as a thematic unit; however, the miscellany is packed not only with echoes of poems appearing earlier in the volume but also of poems from prior collections.  In the concluding section, readers will note, for example, the reappearance of the Thorn Merchant in “The Thorn Merchant’s Godson.”  In addition to masks (“The Hedonist”), labyrinths (“Goodness,” “Surrender”), and ghosts (“Last of the Monkey Gods” and “Adonis in the Big Apple,” among others), this section also includes two overtly political poems, “Green” and “Dangerousness,” and the collection’s sole illustration of Komunyakaa’s facility with prose poems (“A Voice on an Answering Machine”).  Although traditional formal elements are not a distinguishing feature of <em>The Chameleon Couch</em>, Komunyakaa’s attention to sound effects in many of the poems is appropriate in a collection incorporating so many musical allusions.  One example from “Ontology &amp; Guinness” in this third section shows that, in addition to his obvious delight in manipulating theme, image, and cultural resourcefulness, the poet has not forsaken basic elements of craft:</p>
<blockquote><p>I can taste tear gas.  I hear a blur<br />
of billy clubs when I hit the drums.<br />
I haven’t witnessed this mug shot<br />
in decades, but I’m facing the mirror.<br />
I’m still the same man.  Almost.<br />
Led Zeppelin is still in my nogginbox.</p></blockquote>
<p>The slant rhymes, assonance, and alliteration are palpable, and examples of the poet’s fine ear can be found in almost every poem.</p>
<p>Yet image, metaphor, and allusion comprise this collection’s dominant currency.  Indeed, the volume is defined by the poet’s focus on image, the plethora of allusions, and the continual return to ideas of absence and estrangement combined with his persistent and effective efforts to deny the reader easy access while offering enough points of contact to keep the reader engaged.  Respect and admiration for a poet of Komunyakaa’s brilliance and resourcefulness requires that one assume that the poet intends every word and at least anticipates every effect.  He thinks about his audience and what their reaction might be.  It could be, of course, that Komunyakaa intends a very small audience for <em>The Chameleon Couch</em>.  But poems like “Grunge,” with its almost slapstick confusion of courtly love and Courtney Love, suggest otherwise.  Komunyakaa knows how to make a poem accessible.  He also knows how to make poems simultaneously difficult and rewarding.  “Flesh,” for example, certainly requires either prior knowledge of Dante and Beatrice or determination to figure it out.  Even poems like “Adonis in the Big Apple,” which will leave most readers scratching their heads about the identity of the protagonist (is it Jimmy Blanton?), invite—and then reward—curiosity and exploration.  Other poems, however, tease and seem to thwart understanding intentionally.  For example, there is no discernible reason, other than delight in the music, to insert into “Goodness” these lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . On how many paths<br />
do we dare seek the spun knot<br />
beneath the plum tree bent down<br />
with blooms in the Middle Kingdom?</p></blockquote>
<p>It would be sadistic to invite a reader into a poem with the sole intent of baffling her halfway in.  In that case, one might interpret the third section’s “Surrender” as less of a description and more of a command.  But Komunyakaa is not cruel.  Therefore, these poems that run along smoothly enough until stiff-arming the reader must have another intent, and only after coming back to the collection after at least one careful reading does one discern Komunyakaa’s masterful pacing and control.  Through the onslaught of mythical, musical, and historical allusions—through the back and forth of offering access and slamming the door—the poet makes a poem of the book, a poem willing to explore what is just beyond reach and the ways we hide ourselves for self-preservation, for life.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft" title="secure the shadow" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/621/files/2012/05/secure-the-shadow.jpeg" alt="" width="115" height="172" />Claudia Emerson’s poems have always stalked liminal territories—abandoned houses, vestigial buildings reclaimed by wildness, bodies caught in birth and death throes, the crucibles of girlhood, middle and old-age, the half-lives of institutions, situations, places, and families evaporating or succumbing to obliteration even as they tenaciously abide. She finds the sweet spot—the blue, the bent, the worried note—between lyric and narrative. Image and reality. Voice and silence. In the way that Emily Dickinson&#8217;s poems represent unnamed, precipitating crises of terror and awe by the word “it,” appearing at times in Dickinson as the contraction “Twas” (“It is dead – find it,” for example, or “It dropped so low in my regard” or “’Twas like a Maelstrom, with a notch” or “’Twas warm at first, like us”), Emerson’s <em>Secure the Shadow</em> is rife with the word.<span>  </span>In the opening, sonnet-haunted 14-line section of “Half-Life: Pittsylvania County, Virginia,” for instance, Emerson uses some form of “it” six times—</p>
<blockquote><p>That some slow, cold distant planet formed<br />
with a core of ice and stone and named<br />
for the embodiment of sky and heaven<br />
should have anything to do with it seemed wrong—<br />
given its rumored rise from pitchblende to the surface<br />
of fields and pasture, its dissolve into the wells<br />
dug and the ponds made for the animals,<br />
or its decay into the brief, more deadly</p>
<p>daughters—an old explosion’s persistent, widening<br />
wake—and now even more wrong, given its ungodly<br />
worth to the men who had already sold<br />
the rights to it, ignorant of the worse cost<br />
of confusing what chooses us with what we choose,<br />
the near-infinite half-life of remains.</p></blockquote>
<p>Emerson, like Dickinson, is less concerned with naming the ineffable source of horror or grief as she is with exploring its history and its aftermath, or its manifestation in “some small forgotten thing.” In “It,” a poem about what can happen to the human spirit forced to endure the travesties of warfare, Emerson excavates, again, not for the reason or cause of trauma, but for the “mouth closed-calm part of it,” for the aftermath of being blindsided, “with no way to tell it.”<span>  </span>The implication of this unnamable “it” is brought into concert with image and shadow in an italicized passage about a photograph from war-time,</p>
<blockquote><p>              &#8230;a girl, naked<br />
the scorched disfigurement</p>
<p>of her back unseen, inescapable<br />
as what had been the road</p>
<p>behind her, its vanishing point<br />
consumed inside an earthbound</p>
<p>cloud, her scream—seared<br />
aperture to something</p>
<p>the image cannot document.</p></blockquote>
<p>The undocumentable dimension reverberating beyond this image or of any effort we make in poems or photographs to frame and understand the horrific is something Emerson deepens into and confronts at the poem’s close, in a passage which talks back to the earlier photograph as it describes the experience of a cousin, a Vietnam war veteran:</p>
<blockquote><p>          &#8230;He would be<br />
matter of fact, telling me about</p>
<p>the Agent Orange he’d breathed, believed revenant<br />
in a tumor, the cancer in his throat—</p>
<p>its remission. Not a day had passed<br />
when he hadn’t smelled it, tasted it—</p>
<p>the <em>it</em> slender and exact as a compass needle—<br />
he would say as though to the road ahead,</p>
<p>or suddenly blind to it, his eyes, tongue, throat,<br />
his voice I would hear burning with</p>
<p>a knowing beyond memory—wordless,<br />
imageless—the body’s own account.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Secure the Shadow</em> is not as overtly sequential or serial in its conception and curation as some of Emerson’s earlier collections, but the word “It,” comprised of the “columnar self” of the “I/i” and the torso crux of the “t,” becomes, as the book progresses, a kind of ideogram for the body/shadow that haunts and moves, pilgrim-like, throughout the poems. Like the “hinges, latches, / doorknobs, keys still sunk in the locks” that remain in smoldering ash after the house fire in the opening poem, “Late April House Fire Along Interstate 81,” the “it” is “all that does not burn,” even if its nominal antecedent cannot be adequately articulated or fixed. The history of the shadow and its body, as Charles Wright reminds us, may be short, it may be a “brief, nearly // beautiful suspension that changes nothing,” but this does not deter Emerson from delving there, at the liminal “hourless” nexus it creates, where the meanings and the mysteries are.</p>
<p>Proving the interplay of self and body is, of course, the shadow, derived from the Old English <em>sceadu</em> and in its most common usage denoting a dark figure or image caste on the ground by a body or other object intercepting light.<span>  </span>Cognate with <em>shade</em> (a protective barrier but also a spirit, ghost, or apparition), a shadow can also mean a darkness, a semblance, a trace, the dark part of a photograph or other picture, a period of gloom, a dominant or pervasive threat, an inseparable companion, a spy.All of these meanings and more float over Emerson’s collection, perhaps most powerfully in the title poem, which derives from a slogan for mortuary photography—that is, from an advertisement for a company engaged in the practice of taking photographs of dead loved ones:<span>  </span>“Secure the shadow ‘ere the substance fade.” Of one such photograph that the speaker is thinking of buying, Emerson writes (and note, again, the way “it” ghosts the poem with provocative pronominal slippage): “It appears at first glance to be an infant / asleep before the fact of death is clear.” The speaker goes on to say that “the photograph contains the whole of it” and, later, that “while / the posture is of sleep, the heavy-lidded / inward gaze of the eyes, not quite closed, / makes no pretense of it.” After considering the mother of the dead child and the other children she may have subsequently borne, “who lived and in surviving her / let go this image they must have feared,” the speaker explains how</p>
<p>with some reluctance, I purchase its further<br />
removal from them, from her—making mine<br />
this orphaned but still secure correspondence<br />
with all that is about to disappear.</p>
<p>All manner of threshold places allow Emerson to position herself at the juncture of what is about to but which has not yet completely disappeared. Porches, which belong both to house and to the outside world, figure in several poems about the incipient or recent death of loved ones. In “The Porch,” Emerson begins</p>
<blockquote><p>This is not illness, not yet dying,<br />
this stillness a changed way</p>
<p>of being here on the porch.</p></blockquote>
<p>Emerson juxtaposes “illness” and “stillness” here in way that shows us how these states of being inhabit and complicate one another. “Variations from the Porch,” an elegy for the speaker’s brother, positions a speaker on a porch although “the season for it [is] past”:</p>
<blockquote><p>                         I don’t know</p>
<p>what felt safe about that bleak<br />
reclusion, out where anyone</p>
<p>could have seen me; but I<br />
understand now that when</p>
<p>a bird sleeps under its own wing,<br />
it is the world that ceases to see.</p></blockquote>
<p>A group of children in “Animal Funerals, 1964,” caught as they are between innocence and experience, conduct a service for a dead blue jay by building a “delicate lychgate of willow fronds, // supple and green, laced through with chains of clover,” symbolic bower interface between what “was real” about death and what was part of their “necessary rehearsals” for it. In “Vacancy,” a motel swimming pool allows the girl speaker her liminal space, “My favorite place to be, just beneath / the surface, the underwater pool lights // coming on with night,” the poet/speaker weightless among “those fathomless sources // of small light I did not want to give up, // plenty of air yet in the joyous hold of my lungs.”</p>
<p>I have been reading Claudia Emerson’s poems for over 20 years; I doubt she will ever write, say, or sing anything I won’t lean in eagerly to hear. Her flood subjects—death, grief, the angel of history, the deep delight of story, music and its healing pulse—prevail, but her poems never lapse into parodies of themselves, stylistically or thematically. Emerson’s work is unafraid of the silence surrounding its ineffable “it” and her attention to it touches in the reader’s shadow/self a sorrow and capacity for wonder that feels veracious and inevitable. Emerson knows, when she writes of the “beautiful suspension that changes nothing,” that what Auden famously says in his elegy for Yeats is true: “poetry makes nothing happen.” We are born and die, we witness and our part in it all ends, even as the world, as Emerson puts it in “Jubilation,” goes “on bright and raucous / without it, no worse for the absence, perhaps.” But poetry, as Auden puts it, though it may not change anything, “survives / In the valley of its saying . . . // it survives, / A way of happening, a mouth.” <em>Secure the Shadow</em> is, like all of Emerson’s books, the kind of poetry tat helps a person to live, to believe that</p>
<blockquote><p> . . . surely that was jubilation she heard<br />
in the cicadas’ immediate flourish</p>
<p>of sound, as though the hour itself had been<br />
restored with the bird it had moved through.</p></blockquote>
