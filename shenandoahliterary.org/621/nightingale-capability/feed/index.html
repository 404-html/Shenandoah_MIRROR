					<description><![CDATA[I think the nightingale poem here is an artistically well-chosen &quot;least favorite&quot;--since that ode, in particular, draws no differentiation between pleasure and pain--while the speaker of the this poem clearly does--his final gesture being the choice of pleasure--his lover&#039;s (and his own) satisfaction. Of course--it&#039;s more complicated than that--but this poem elbows Keats in the ribs sweetly--by suggesting there are fleeting moments we may steal away from Truth in the service of love and happiness. The real beauty of the this negatively capable poem is that both Keats and the writer embrace paradox--but while Keats tips his drink to the dark side of it--Wrigley tilts his wine to the light.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think you&#039;ve done wonderful work with &quot;Nightingale Capability,&quot; but Keats&#039; Nightingale is one of my favorites. Back in 1985, a friend and I made a short documentary film about the difficulties people face reading poetry, using Nightingale as our sample. The half-hour film was nominated that year for an Academy Award for short subject documentary. Didn&#039;t win but at least Keats&#039; name and face flashed on millions of TV sets around the world for a moment. If you go back to Rome, check to see that Keats didn&#039;t roll over in his grave.]]></description>
