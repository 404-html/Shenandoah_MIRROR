					<description><![CDATA[As my professor, poet Lesley Wheeler explained how critic Northrop Frye&#039;s understanding of poetry centers around the use of &quot;babble&quot; (word play) and &quot;doodle&quot; (visual construction).  In Holmberg&#039;s &quot;Zebra Finch at Petco,&quot; a relatively standard-looking free-verse poem written in couplets, draws from the wide range of verbal possibilities &quot;babble&quot; brings to the table.  I love Holmberg&#039;s phrase &quot;ember on each cheek, buff bright/ the beak&#039;s rose hip hue. His eldeberry eye&quot; precisely because of its rich alliteration and the continuity of sound between words.  &quot;Zebra Finch at Petco&#039;s&quot; babble surfaces throughout, from the repeated -ear sound of &quot;chandelier earring&quot; to the closing line &quot;fussing/ a small snow through the hot and pearly hollow.&quot;  The movement afforded by the alliteration and emphasis on flowing diction drives Holmberg&#039;s densely imagistic poem along, and keeps it from falling into a quagmire of disconnected, though well-wrought images.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This poem is fueled by the precision of its imagery. The opening lines are so delicately exact and thus entirely appropriate for the subject matter of the zebra finch. The details are also colorful, and I enjoyed lines such as &quot;the beak&#039;s rose hip hue&quot; and &quot;his elderberry eye,&quot; for their subtle alliteration, a similarity mirrored in the shades of pinks and reds. With the behavior of these two birds, and as is true in engaging poetry, the subtle movements indicate much larger gestures.]]></description>
