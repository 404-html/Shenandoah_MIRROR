					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know what filter you&#039;re looking through, but, I suppose, opinions ARE like a..holes -- everyone&#039;s got one. I only know that  &quot;the Last Child&quot;, by John Hart, is easily one of the most provocative, moving, and entertaining books I&#039;ve ever read, and I&#039;m seventy -- I&#039;ve read a bunch! I would go so far as to proclaim it&#039;s one of the best, if not THE best, I&#039;ve ever perused. I loved it and have nothing but praise for the author!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think the nightingale poem here is an artistically well-chosen &quot;least favorite&quot;--since that ode, in particular, draws no differentiation between pleasure and pain--while the speaker of the this poem clearly does--his final gesture being the choice of pleasure--his lover&#039;s (and his own) satisfaction. Of course--it&#039;s more complicated than that--but this poem elbows Keats in the ribs sweetly--by suggesting there are fleeting moments we may steal away from Truth in the service of love and happiness. The real beauty of the this negatively capable poem is that both Keats and the writer embrace paradox--but while Keats tips his drink to the dark side of it--Wrigley tilts his wine to the light.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really liked the idea of this story, although I had a difficult time reading it.  I would have enjoyed it more if it had been written with more conventional punctuation.  And I think actual quotations of the characters would have helped me.  I&#039;m a fan of Cormac McCarthy books, but I don&#039;t like his style of not clearly indicating the words of the different speakers.  It frustrates me to have to back up and re-read passages in order to figure out who&#039;s saying what.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think you&#039;ve done wonderful work with &quot;Nightingale Capability,&quot; but Keats&#039; Nightingale is one of my favorites. Back in 1985, a friend and I made a short documentary film about the difficulties people face reading poetry, using Nightingale as our sample. The half-hour film was nominated that year for an Academy Award for short subject documentary. Didn&#039;t win but at least Keats&#039; name and face flashed on millions of TV sets around the world for a moment. If you go back to Rome, check to see that Keats didn&#039;t roll over in his grave.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This piece carries with it an artistic presence I can&#039;t really put into words.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This piece carries with it an artistic presence I can&#8217;t really put into words. Jeanne Walker&#8217;s claim, &#8220;It was finally images and metaphors with their multivalent power that I followed out of my mother&#8217;s fundamentalism,&#8221; is especially fitting as she now commands quite a mastery of them.

					<description><![CDATA[This story is an interesting examination of not just baseball, but the exhilarating feeling when you&#039;re doing something you truly love. Everyone has something they&#039;re passionate about, sports, music, art; something that seems to stop the flow of time and allows you to briefly live in the Present, the now. It ends the constant dialogue in your head about work, school, or any other obligation, and makes you more like an animal, simply alive. The Present is fleeting though. Once you&#039;ve experienced it, all you want to do is return, like the author, to the next at-bat.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As my professor, poet Lesley Wheeler explained how critic Northrop Frye&#039;s understanding of poetry centers around the use of &quot;babble&quot; (word play) and &quot;doodle&quot; (visual construction).  In Holmberg&#039;s &quot;Zebra Finch at Petco,&quot; a relatively standard-looking free-verse poem written in couplets, draws from the wide range of verbal possibilities &quot;babble&quot; brings to the table.  I love Holmberg&#039;s phrase &quot;ember on each cheek, buff bright/ the beak&#039;s rose hip hue. His eldeberry eye&quot; precisely because of its rich alliteration and the continuity of sound between words.  &quot;Zebra Finch at Petco&#039;s&quot; babble surfaces throughout, from the repeated -ear sound of &quot;chandelier earring&quot; to the closing line &quot;fussing/ a small snow through the hot and pearly hollow.&quot;  The movement afforded by the alliteration and emphasis on flowing diction drives Holmberg&#039;s densely imagistic poem along, and keeps it from falling into a quagmire of disconnected, though well-wrought images.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This poem is fueled by the precision of its imagery. The opening lines are so delicately exact and thus entirely appropriate for the subject matter of the zebra finch. The details are also colorful, and I enjoyed lines such as &quot;the beak&#039;s rose hip hue&quot; and &quot;his elderberry eye,&quot; for their subtle alliteration, a similarity mirrored in the shades of pinks and reds. With the behavior of these two birds, and as is true in engaging poetry, the subtle movements indicate much larger gestures.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really identify with this short story, as my family also has a large fish mounted on the wall of our home. As the story goes, my grandfather caught this trout during a fishing trip and it is one of the only relics bequeathed to my mother upon his death that she remains devoted to. When we moved this past summer, she was entirely focused on the fish since it is not attached to a board, but instead is suspended and appears to leap on the wall. The movers were instructed numerous times to “Be careful with the fish!” In her story “Trophy,” Dawna Kemper conveys the almost irrational connection that a woman’s husband has to her rainbow trout. In contrast to his sense of pride, the narrator searches to find beauty, or even traces of “rainbow” on the fish’s body. Her reflections on how the fish has been cleaned, emptied out and fitted with a new tongue show the reader that she realizes it is a beautified representation of the thriving, wild and strong creature it once was. The jig’s placement next to the fish serves as a reminder that he was trapped, manipulated by a human’s hook and lure. Consequently, it seems as though this fish represents a slight distance that the woman has from her husband. She has heard his story multiple times, even envisioned herself as the fisherwoman, yet the fish’s presence over her bed still distracts her and gives her a feeling of discontent. It is thus apparent that she is unable to understand the immense pride he feels for this rare catch.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The relationship between the author and his father evokes a deep, but difficult, love.  Combining baseball and religion seems odd at first, but the author skillfully weaves the two together in order too create an effect more powerful than the two subjects standing alone.  The images are unique and vivid.  I never felt out of touch with the situation despite my lack of knowledge concerning baseball.  As my own father&#039;s child prodigy, I understand the complexities of a relationship driven by success in a sport.  The author pulls together a moving tale of a father and a son, a boy and his God, and an athlete and his sport.  Well done!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Her Last Boy, by Thomas McConnell, moved me deeply.  The beginning emits the sweet southern relationship between a grandmother and her grandson.  But as the story continues, her monologue becomes bittersweet.  The reader can hear the pain in her voice and see the horrors of her past.  The grandmother represents a character that all readers wish a happy ending upon.  But the story cultures a fear in readers, as they fear the possibility of living through experiences similar to hers.  Because of this, I almost wanted to distance myself from her to lesson the pain.  Her pain is one every parent fears.  No one hopes to bury a child they bore into the world, much less watch him experience pain they can’t alleviate.]]></description>

The use of sensory detail in the first paragraph with the wind catching Letty’s hand and her dust-coated lips created a sense of immediacy that really hooked me in. Both Letty and the girl are clearly defined and engaging in this subtle, provocative piece. The landscape and setting of McCook was very well developed and created a striking backdrop.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Christina,
Thank you for giving this little piece such a close reading. I like the episodic in fiction. A moment in time. A day in the life. You may be interested to know that it evolved from notes I took on an exhibition of Dorothea Lange&#039;s photographs of the Yakima Valley where I live and teach. http://depts.washington.edu/labpics/repository/v/depress/lange/8b34383r.jpg.html]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The power of this story derives from its tragedy as well as the vibrant language in the narrative. The author makes effective both of these forces by resisting over-dramatization or over-statement. This method allows lines such as “The foreign officer has a scar like a crescent slicing the back of his skull, as if someone wanted to peer inside” to show as deliberately as the scar itself. These images are grotesque and yet described with a delicacy that provides insight into the narrator. Observations such as “the child’s eyes were enormous” suggest that the translator does not see the child in the ruthless way of his officer; however, he must act the part. In this manner, Kemper’s language mirrors that of the translator’s: with restrained words both speakers must convey an image that cannot entirely be made explicit.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This story contains an intriguing blend of past, present, and future, one that is made all the more impressive given the length of the piece. Ms. Hollmeyer artfully raises the question of legacy -- the reader is left to ponder what it means to grow old and what happens of our belongings, our memories, and ultimately of ourselves after we&#039;re gone. I found myself viewing Dot as an artifact in her own right; amongst the relics housed in the Ice River History Museum, she carries with her a history that is essentially meaningless to both the daughter and the docent, just as the trinkets do. This lack of significance is more substantial with regard Mary, for her own mother has a past of which she was unable, or perhaps unwilling, to learn more about. By the end of the story, I felt motivated to delve into the shelves of my own home -- hopefully I will be able to unearth some trinkets of my own, ones that will not lose their uniqueness with the passing of time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[After I finished reading the first paragraph of this story, I knew that I was going to love the writer’s style. I could immediately picture myself in my own car, arm stuck out the window, feeling both simultaneously propelled and thwarted by the oncoming wind. Widner’s narrative does an excellent job of drawing the reader in immediately; we want to root for Letty and the little girl. The subtle descriptions of the girl’s foster home conditions juxtaposed with Letty’s conflicting and somewhat ambiguous feelings about her own job combine to give the brief story a heavy, yet meaningful tone. One of the strongest elements of Widner’s piece is its ability to provide a fleeting look into the “vague relationship” between Letty and the girl, and also provoke the reader to think about what happens on either side of the narrative. How did Letty end up in this career path? What happens to the little girl and her grubby hand gripping the business card?]]></description>
