					<description><![CDATA[This is the Author and the man I remember.  The run-on lines that whisk you along so fast it&#039;s like seeing a life pass outside the train window.  Always wondering what&#039;s the 2nd and 3rd tier story line running beneath this word flow that I don&#039;t see  is.   I&#039; m too caught up in fast bloom of the characters to see any deeper.

					<description><![CDATA[I really liked the idea of this story, although I had a difficult time reading it.  I would have enjoyed it more if it had been written with more conventional punctuation.  And I think actual quotations of the characters would have helped me.  I&#039;m a fan of Cormac McCarthy books, but I don&#039;t like his style of not clearly indicating the words of the different speakers.  It frustrates me to have to back up and re-read passages in order to figure out who&#039;s saying what.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Her Last Boy, by Thomas McConnell, moved me deeply.  The beginning emits the sweet southern relationship between a grandmother and her grandson.  But as the story continues, her monologue becomes bittersweet.  The reader can hear the pain in her voice and see the horrors of her past.  The grandmother represents a character that all readers wish a happy ending upon.  But the story cultures a fear in readers, as they fear the possibility of living through experiences similar to hers.  Because of this, I almost wanted to distance myself from her to lesson the pain.  Her pain is one every parent fears.  No one hopes to bury a child they bore into the world, much less watch him experience pain they can’t alleviate.]]></description>
