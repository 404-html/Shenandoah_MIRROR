					<description><![CDATA[This piece carries with it an artistic presence I can&#039;t really put into words. Jeanne Walker&#039;s claim, &quot;It was finally images and metaphors with their multivalent power that I followed out of my mother&#039;s fundamentalism,&quot; is especially fitting as she now commands quite a mastery of them. Her description of the week at Bible Camp as a sentence, with the teasing of a counselor as the end mark, and her articulation of struggling to understand &quot;the opera of adolescence&quot; fit fluidly into the progression of the work. I don&#039;t normally go for reading with a lesson (moral sounds too contrived), but this essay ends with not so much a lesson as an enlightenment. Everyone needs something to &quot;navigate by,&quot; and Jeanne&#039;s cross, &quot;like a star that had fallen to earth,&quot; is none other than the perfect image.]]></description>
