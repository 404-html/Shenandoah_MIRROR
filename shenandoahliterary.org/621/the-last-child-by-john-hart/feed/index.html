I only know that  &quot;the Last Child&quot;, by John Hart, is easily one of the most provocative, moving, and entertaining books I&#039;ve ever read, and I&#039;m seventy -- I&#039;ve read a bunch! I would go so far as to proclaim it&#039;s one of the best, if not THE best, I&#039;ve ever perused. I loved it and have nothing but praise for the author!]]></description>
