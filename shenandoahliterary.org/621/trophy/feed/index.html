					<description><![CDATA[I really identify with this short story, as my family also has a large fish mounted on the wall of our home. As the story goes, my grandfather caught this trout during a fishing trip and it is one of the only relics bequeathed to my mother upon his death that she remains devoted to. When we moved this past summer, she was entirely focused on the fish since it is not attached to a board, but instead is suspended and appears to leap on the wall. The movers were instructed numerous times to “Be careful with the fish!” In her story “Trophy,” Dawna Kemper conveys the almost irrational connection that a woman’s husband has to her rainbow trout. In contrast to his sense of pride, the narrator searches to find beauty, or even traces of “rainbow” on the fish’s body. Her reflections on how the fish has been cleaned, emptied out and fitted with a new tongue show the reader that she realizes it is a beautified representation of the thriving, wild and strong creature it once was. The jig’s placement next to the fish serves as a reminder that he was trapped, manipulated by a human’s hook and lure. Consequently, it seems as though this fish represents a slight distance that the woman has from her husband. She has heard his story multiple times, even envisioned herself as the fisherwoman, yet the fish’s presence over her bed still distracts her and gives her a feeling of discontent. It is thus apparent that she is unable to understand the immense pride he feels for this rare catch.]]></description>
