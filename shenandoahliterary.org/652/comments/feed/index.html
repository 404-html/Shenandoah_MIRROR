					<description><![CDATA[The title of this poem drew me in immediately. The juxtaposition of &quot;Mozart&quot; and &quot;Dump,&quot; two words that evoke completely different reactions, certainly has an intriguing effect that is sustained throughout the poem with the use of musical terms amidst unpleasant descriptions and occurrences. The discussion of Renoir’s painting furthers this idea and calls attention to the differences between a romanticized world and reality.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As a gardener who is about to lose the plot she has tended for 28 years, I cannot help but understand and cheer for the volunteers who have rescued these plants from steam shovels.  I pictured them taking these plants, most perennials, roots an all, to live another day in another place.  A victory, or rescue, small but real, against the creep of concrete and, perhaps, the conversion of land enjoyed by all to land reserved for the privileged.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Once again, you wow me with your ability to weave a story that captivates me.  The younger sister in charge of the older sister&#039;s mental state, and all of the details you give to try to understand why she swallows these foreign objects fascinated me to the point that I was lost in the story.  Your expressions and details fill in every aspect of the characters from the apartment to the difference of Florida and Santa Fe, to the lightning, to the expressive verbs and adjectives that fill in the characters. You make me want to know why Laura swallows these items from the very beginning to the very end, showing the sister wondering how she herself does these actions. You are a genius with your word selection in creating your characters.  BRAVOOOOO!]]></description>
