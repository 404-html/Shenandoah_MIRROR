					<description><![CDATA[As a gardener who is about to lose the plot she has tended for 28 years, I cannot help but understand and cheer for the volunteers who have rescued these plants from steam shovels.  I pictured them taking these plants, most perennials, roots an all, to live another day in another place.  A victory, or rescue, small but real, against the creep of concrete and, perhaps, the conversion of land enjoyed by all to land reserved for the privileged.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This poem so eloquently captures the clash of natural and urbanity that occurs in a city. The playful personification, substitution of flowers and trees for people, and general whirl of activity that goes on in this poem tempts you to read it as a happy poem, but there is a negative note to it. The crushing of petals, bullying of the river, reference to a selloff and crowdedness combined with the idea that we carry flowers in our shopping bags makes us you stop and wonder if we are trying to buy nature, and then ask: can we buy nature? The harmony between and seamless integration  of city into nature that, if quickly read, this poem might suggest on the surface is criticized if read thoroughly.]]></description>
