					<description><![CDATA[I love this poem. In my own visit to Gettysburg one fall in middle school, I was completely taken aback by the breathtaking beauty of the battlefield -- it didn&#039;t seem like a place that could have held such bloodshed. I like the differing perspective that Adair brings to the idea of looking upon a battlefield, completely emptied of its context: more of apathy than of disbelief in this poem&#039;s case, but still resulting in the same effect of alienation. History might seem incredibly far away to us, even if the little signs of life (the caterpillar, &quot;the sagging barn&quot;) we experience near the site of a major national conflict have been happening there for centuries. They&#039;re what bind us together and suggest that even though our ancestors&#039; lifestyles seem foreign to us based on historical distance alone, there&#039;s probably more to relate to than we might think.]]></description>
