					<description><![CDATA[This poem was entertaining from start to finish. I think what I enjoy most is the honest tone that is woven throughout the entire piece. Every writer has had that experience of feeling like the piece they&#039;ve chosen to share at a public reading is &quot;bad;&quot; you get up to the podium, and there&#039;s no turning back. No matter how &quot;bad&quot; you think your poem or short story is, you&#039;ve committed yourself to reading it. I think Mr. Kirby has done a great job of capturing these feelings of self doubt by putting a humorous spin on this nerve-wracking experience. In the end, he explains that a poetry reading has the power to inspire audience members and to pull people out of a dark place, which is motivation enough for writers everywhere to stand up and read their &quot;bad&quot; poems. Even if you think it&#039;s bad, someone out there will think otherwise. And your words may just save that person&#039;s life.]]></description>
