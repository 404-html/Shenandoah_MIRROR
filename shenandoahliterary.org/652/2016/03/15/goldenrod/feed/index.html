					<description><![CDATA[I like how Miriam Kotzin personifies the goldenrod plant in this poem. The opening lines, &quot;it busies itself with hoarding the heat and the sunlight&quot; makes me think of a young eager farmhand, busy preparing himself for the Summer season. Kotzin&#039;s exchange between the sunlight and the goldenrod makes you wonder what plants would think and say if they had the capacity to do so. I enjoy her interpretation of this relationship.]]></description>
