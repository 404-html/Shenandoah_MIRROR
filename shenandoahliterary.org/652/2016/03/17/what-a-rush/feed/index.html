					<description><![CDATA[Wow. This poem conveys raw emotion, an intriguing blend of love, hatred, longing, regret. It is even more intriguing because at points it is difficult to distinguish who is feeling what emotion. Who took who for granted? I keep finding evidence for either side.

I love that the first stanza follows a dreamy, quiet pattern one might expect in the average reminiscent love poem, but the second stanza jolts the reader into an expression of anger, agitation. The contrast plunges us from dream to nightmare, yet the narrator presumably does not want to wake up. The frustration he feels is almost tangible; there are so many things he would have changed while Claudia lived, but now it&#039;s too late.]]></description>
