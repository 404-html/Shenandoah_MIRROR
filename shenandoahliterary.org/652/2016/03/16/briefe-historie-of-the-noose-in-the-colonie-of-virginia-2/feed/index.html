					<description><![CDATA[At first I thought Berryman hadn&#039;t died, or was being channeled. The syntax. The ampersands aplenty. And the history rendered with shining details. The odd near, slant, or just off rhymes. But each sectioned pushed me forward (though the not strict chronology still puzzles), until 
 Kid Rock made a cameo, and Nine Ice Nails had a product placement. I knew for a fact I was caught in the Wojahn webs. Rock N Roll rules.

I offer what follows as further backdrop to the poem - not that it requires more evidence or is unclear in its message and purpose. It&#039;s just damn interesting.

The honorific of being the first recorded execution in the new colonies went to Captain George Kendall who did the dance of death in the Jamestown colony of Virginia in 1608. Kendall was executed after being accused of being a suspected Spanish spy. In 1612, Virginia Governor Sir Thomas Dale enacted the Divine, Moral and Martial Laws, (he was a far-thinker, and would be right at home today) which provided the death penalty for even minor offenses such as stealing grapes, killing chickens, and trading with Indians.]]></description>
