					<description><![CDATA[Once again, you wow me with your ability to weave a story that captivates me.  The younger sister in charge of the older sister&#039;s mental state, and all of the details you give to try to understand why she swallows these foreign objects fascinated me to the point that I was lost in the story.  Your expressions and details fill in every aspect of the characters from the apartment to the difference of Florida and Santa Fe, to the lightning, to the expressive verbs and adjectives that fill in the characters. You make me want to know why Laura swallows these items from the very beginning to the very end, showing the sister wondering how she herself does these actions. You are a genius with your word selection in creating your characters.  BRAVOOOOO!]]></description>
