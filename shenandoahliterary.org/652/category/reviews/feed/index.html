								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although William Faulkner’s oft-paraphrased claim that “[t]he past is never dead. It’s not even past,” is by its own terms continuously relevant, there are times during which its applicability seems more immediate than others. This is one of those times. More specifically, Thomas Jefferson, particularly as he is associated with questions of power, privilege, and race—questions that illuminate the gap between America’s promise and its fulfillment—continues to command the modern imagination. Within the last ten days, a review in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> and an interview in <em>Slate</em> have considered Jefferson in these terms. The Broadway musical <em>Hamilton</em> no doubt has fueled some of the current interest, but neither a singular focus on Jefferson’s relationship with Sally Hemings nor a debate about how best to dramatize eighteenth and nineteenth-century race and gender dynamics does adequate justice to the immeasurable importance of Thomas Jefferson in the development of this country.</p>
<p>The publication of Lisa Russ Spaar’s new anthology, <em>Monticello in Mind</em>, contributes significantly to the conversation. Few contemporary books of poetry explore Faulkner’s assertion as thoroughly and as adroitly as this welcome volume. It gathers a single poem from each of fifty contemporary poets and combines those ninety-one pages of poetry with a generous introduction and commentary. The result is in an anthology likely to appeal not only to poets and the poetry faithful but also to a broader audience still open to exploring the genius and the turpitude upon which the character and the institutions of the United States have been, and are still being, developed.</p>
<p>The variety and juxtaposition of the individual voices, themes, and styles presented in <em>Monticello in Mind</em> exemplify the complexity of Jefferson’s legacy. Further, as a group, the poems in the anthology acknowledge that Jefferson’s project—the sum of his professed ideals—has at best been only partially achieved. Indeed, by quoting from Jefferson’s <em>Preamble to a Bill for the More General Diffusion of Knowledge (1778)</em> in the epigraph to his <em>terza rima </em>poem “Thomas Jefferson in Kathmandu,” Ravi Shankar raises the specter of the project’s ultimate failure: “Experience hath shewn, that even under the best forms of government, those entrusted with power have, in time, and by slow operations, perverted it into tyranny.” The poem’s speaker recognizes the contradictions between Jefferson’s dreams for the country and his actions and attitudes: “I’m on the other side of the world and still / can’t see clearly what has succeeded and what failed / in the grand American experiment” (52-4).</p>
<p>Many of the featured poets scrutinize Jefferson’s calls for equality. Making this examination particularly effective and sobering is the multiplicity of cultural lenses through which the poets see issues of race and power. In “On Imagination,” Kevin Young moves from the poem’s first lines directly addressing Phillis Wheatley, a poet whose literary worth was denied by Jefferson, to Wheatley’s own thoughts as she realizes that her words—her worth— will not be appreciated in her own time. As the child of a white father and black mother, Natasha Trethewey addresses in “Enlightenment” the relationship between her autobiographical speaker and her father and how understandings of Jefferson’s legacy are still influenced by race. Mark Jarman’s approach to these issues in “Nora’s Nickel” is more oblique than some others in the anthology, but his subtlety only heightens the effect of the speaker’s description of his Southern grandmother’s “professed love of all her Mexican friends / like the grocer’s boy who came to her back door” at her home in San Diego (20-1).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding recurring treatments of Jefferson’s hypocrisy about slavery, particularly as evidenced by his relationship with Sally Hemings, <em>Monticello in Mind</em> is not thematically monolithic. The poets presented here concern themselves also with Monticello itself—its gardens, its architecture, and its inhabitants. Others address the contradiction between Jefferson’s expressions of admiration for Native Americans and his willingness to destroy them in the service of national expansion. Several, including Ron Slate and John Casteen, find their primary metaphor in Jefferson’s bible—his attempt to redact from the Gospels any verses that suggest the supernatural. They consider the limitations bound to result when one denies the possibility of anything other than what appears rational and expedient in one’s own time. One of the most beautiful and moving poems in the anthology is Kate Daniels’s “Reading a Biography of Thomas Jefferson in the Months of My Son’s Recovery.” Daniels combines a meditation on Jefferson’s “flawed example of human greatness” (28), his double-mindedness, with a compassionate reflection on the speaker’s son and how “two minds circulated inside him, / Tantalizing its brand-new victim with generations / Of charged-up narratives of drugs and drink  . . .” (49-51).</p>
<p>The diversity of approaches to Jefferson is reflected, too, in the formal range of the poems. Spaar’s decision to present the poems alphabetically by poets’ last names results in some fascinating, if accidental, juxtapositions. Reading Jarman’s double sonnet “Nora’s Nickel” immediately after Brenda Hillman’s “Near the Rim of the Ideal” is a reading experience not to be missed, and Terrance Hayes’s imagination broadens expectations of what a poem might be in “A Poem Inspired by a Frederick Douglass Middle Schooler’s Essay on Thomas Jefferson.”</p>
<p>The thoughtful anthologist’s task is never easy. Spaar describes her methods and motivations in her introduction and afterward, but the challenge is significant, particularly when the subject is as complex as describing the flaws and beauty of the still-coarse fabric of the United States, a fabric still unfinished on the loom designed by Jefferson. Spaar’s effort is remarkably successful. The diversity of poets, voices, styles, and perspectives contributes to the ongoing discussion of the status of the American adventure and to the success of Spaar’s own project, which is described in part in Mary Ann Samyn’s observation in “Heirloom” about the ongoing work to create a “more perfect union:”</p>
<p>Some days the sky whitens, but does not absolve.<br />
There is no cure but time, and for time, no cure.</p>
<p>Thus, among the beauties, grief, also,<br />
Itself an heirloom, held up, handed down.</p>
<p>History begins to come true as we tell it.<br />
This is the spot where. (7-12)</p>

Both young men are runaways who’ve traded harsh working conditions and brutal beatings to pursue their fascination with music. Their lives and stories intertwine through their participation in the minstrel tradition. A prolific writer on bluegrass, blues, and jazz, Piazza injects his prose with musical technique and terminology&#8211;so much so that his expertise may be lost on uninitiated readers. Still, it’s easy for any reader, musically inclined or not, to turn the pages of Piazza’s novel as quickly as a banjo player plucks his staccato strings. However, the entertaining melodies that carry <em>A Free State</em> serve as just another veneer covering up the harsh realities of minstrel shows’ roles in our cultural, political, and racial history.</p>
<p>In 1855, nineteen-year-old slave Henry Sims escapes a Virginia plantation and establishes himself in Philadelphia. That same year, a musician from a minstrel troupe hears Henry’s excellent banjo playing and invites the street performer to join his act. Not only does James Douglass’ invitation violate the law in hosting a Negro performer on-stage, but it also violates the tradition of minstrelsy. Minstrel shows, in which white male performers dress in blackface to parody African-influenced song and dance, succeed in entertaining only because of their masks. In assuming blackface and contemporary Ebonics, minstrel acts permit white audiences to enjoy this style of music without accepting or condoning it. Henry nonetheless accepts, donning a “double masquerade” (54), and sets the ball rolling for a number of further complications.</p>
<p>Piazza is at his best when describing the music of the novel. Once the Douglass’ troupe begins to play, they’re all “angles, elbows, knees, bouncing” in rapturous performance, with “bones clicking and arms crisscrossing on and off the beat; the banjo and the fiddle neck and neck with one another as they line sang the familiar song” (126). Meanwhile, “a tidal wave” rolls through the crowd, “submerging the entire world under applause, screams, and hollers, a wall of sound almost physical in its force” (127). The dynamic energy that Piazza can give static text is remarkable. The sounds and rhythm and flow of his prose give life to the musicians and their instruments. Piazza also mixes colloquial descriptions with technical jargon in these scenes of performances. The characters, obviously very skillful musicians, become even more convincing to us as experts or professionals when they comment on the addition of a “perceptible increment of bravado” (127) to a tune or of “a compact fireworks display of triplets, staggered rhythms, reversed patterns” (134). Piazza occasionally gets carried away with detailed, though often metaphorical, descriptions that read more like step-by-step instructions for playing the banjo. He painstakingly illustrates a player “stroking down twice on a low string with his index fingernail, and then plucking once on the short, high string with his thumb, leaving the strings open” (134). Overall, however, Piazza’s poetic passion for music gets his readers stomping and clapping along with the beat and undoubtedly complicates their perception of the serious racism that the novel presents.</p>
<p>Piazza experiments with voice and perspective in creating parallel narratives, mainly of Douglass, Henry, and the bounty hunter Tull. While innovative at times, such as when he slips into a second-person-point of view in which the reader must put himself in a slaves’ shoes, his strategy also fails to tell an engaging story. One of Piazza’s most important perspectives—Douglass’—does more telling than showing. Piazza speeds through a superficial development of Douglass and Henry’s relationship, which would seem to be at the heart of his novel, but he scarcely describes their progression. For this reason, Henry has an unconvincing impact on Douglass by the end of the novel and his feelings of guilt and responsibility seem like polite afterthoughts, for the sake of appearances, rather than genuine emotions. By contrast, some of the most vivid scenes of any of the narratives describe Tull’s utterly evil and barbaric acts of violence. Piazza focuses too much on Tarantino-esque brutality rather than, for example, Douglass and Henry’s one-on-one practice sessions.</p>
<p>As the novel progresses, Piazza weaves these multi-perspective threads tighter and switches between them in quicker succession as they begin to overlap to form the novel’s climax. And it does not take long to get there; Piazza’s plot proceeds rather quickly. At certain turns, he attempts to create mystery and suspense, perhaps stalling his rapid pace, but he ultimately rushes through his straightforward narrative. In effect, the novel skimps on asking for commitment and engagement from the reader. At its conclusion, <em>A Free State</em> leaves the reader wanting more. Not more of the same writing, but more depth, more development, more characterization, more <em>umph</em>. Piazza introduces a unique slave narrative about the talented, eloquent runaway Henry, but the author’s unsatisfying execution does not provoke the emotional response expected from a tale about such hardship, brutality, and hope.</p>
<p>To the characters in <em>A</em> <em>Free State</em>, minstrel shows are a form of escape in antebellum America. Douglass left his family and his home to pursue his passion for music. Henry uses his banjo to create a whole new life for himself, away from his oppressive slave life on the plantation. But the nature of Henry’s disguise proves the more fragile. Set against a historical backdrop, the author comments on the troubling tradition of minstrel shows in our nation’s culture and our responsibility to remember and recall the horrific conditions of slavery. But when Piazza is not entertaining the audience with scenes of high-energy performances, he often underwhelms them with brisk and unsatisfying responses to issues of injustice, prejudice and hardship.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/652/2016/04/02/sweet-caress-bloomsbury-2015-by-william-boyd/sweet-car/" rel="attachment wp-att-304"><img class="alignright  wp-image-304" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/652/files/2016/04/sweet-car-197x300.jpg" alt="sweet car" width="166" height="253" /></a>William Boyd’s <em>Sweet Caress</em> (Bloomsbury 2015) is a sweeping novel written in the voice of one English woman, Amory Clay—but in two different time frames.  An epic story of one woman’s life, punctuated by her experiences with both World Wars, Vietnam, and the American counter-culture, makes up the larger narrative.  The historical story is then punctuated by the shorter “journal” of the months leading up to Amory’s seventieth birthday.  This double-vision brought into sharp focus by the main character, whose eye for detail has made her a successful photographer and story-teller.</p>
<p>One of the most notable aspects of this fine, leisurely novel is the very plausible voice of Amory herself.  She is rather privileged in upbringing, though she falls on some hard times as she makes her way in the male-dominated world of art, but she is likeable—and believable.  Readers may, in fact, forget that this novel was written by a man.  Introspective and honest, Amory reveals herself to be ambitious without being completely career-driven and loving without being sentimental.  Even her long affair with a married man—along with the unpleasant encounter with his wife—does not diminish Amory’s character, either moral or narrative.  She has strong feelings, and she acts on them, but she is not unaware of the impact of her choices on her family and the families of others.  She’s sensible and competent.  As she says, “The fact that he was handsome and successful, selfish and self-absorbed . . . doesn’t reflect badly on me. . . .At certain periods in our live we—men and women—need exactly this type of person. . . . Then growing maturity tells you that this type of person simply will not do any more” (176).</p>
<p>Much of Amory’s life and many of her choices are affected by war—and those effects are largely brought about by men.  Her father returns from World War I suffering from shell-shock (though she never calls it that), and shatters the family with his erratic behavior.  This narrator does not spend pages describing warfare, at least early on.  The damage is suggested by Amory’s matter-of-fact, understated descriptions:</p>
<p>My father, a clever boy, won an exhibition to Lincoln College, Oxford, and became a professional writer (his brother, Walter, died at the Battle of Jutland, 1915). . . .He had become thoroughly middle class; a successful writer of several well-received books married to a judge’s daughter, with three children, living in a large and covetable big house in the East Sussex countryside.  And yet he was not entirely a happy man.  And then the war came and everything went wrong. (16-17)</p>
<p>Everything, indeed, goes wrong, but years elapse in the meantime.  By the onset of World War II, Amory is a working photographer, already with one obscenity charge behind her after taking photos in clubs in Berlin.  She marries a WWII veteran, who is, like her father, traumatized from battle, and in her later years travels to Vietnam in part to recover her professional self.  She asks herself later, “What was it that made me decide I had to go to Vietnam?”  The answer is clear:  “I really wanted  . . . to confront warfare again. . . . War had shaped, directed and distorted my life in so many ways . . . that I think that the zeal I was feeling was an unconscious response to this deeper need. . . .  wanted to experience something of what he had gone through but with my new knowledge—about him, about me—informing everything” (350-351).</p>
<p>Amory does not become a secondary figure, though some may prefer to see a character taking on the big battles of her era herself rather than experiencing them through others.  Amory does not join the military and fight heroically, nor does she magically find herself face to face with any of the famous generals, prime ministers, or presidents.  The “tell it slant” mode of this novel, in fact, adds an element of welcome realism.  The repetition of “I remember” at the beginnings of paragraphs keeps the point of view clearly within Amory’s experience, but placing her at the margins of the great wars of the twentieth century provides a larger political framework for her personal story without creating another <em>Forrest Gump</em>.</p>
<p>Putting main characters smack in the middle of the monumental political events of a period is one of the great temptations of any historical novelist—and it can also be one of the great mistakes.  Boyd avoids this error and so layers his work with cultural significance without trying the reader’s suspension of disbelief.  The addition of many photographs, supposedly Amory’s work, as well as a number of catalogues, of lovers, books, photos, and family members, centers the book on Amory as a complete person in her own right, who has experienced the great cataclysms of her era without becoming engulfed by them.</p>
<p>So the twentieth century winds its bloody way to a close in <em>Sweet Caress</em>, as Amory’s birthday approaches.  This other narrative, set on a small island near Oban in Scotland, neatly spliced into the more historically sweeping story, creeps to its conclusion.  Amory is now a woman in her sixties, more or less retired and suffering from a troublesome neurological problem.  She walks her dog Flam, visits the doctor, lunches with friends, and wards off the attentions of a local octogenarian.  A careful reader will pick up clues along the way of how the novel will end, but this doesn’t diminish its power.  Amory ends her story as she has told it, with calm intelligence and resolve.  At the end, the “Many Lives of Amory Clay” become one, and though the conclusion is not happy, it is deeply satisfying.  It’s quiet and inevitable, perfectly realizing both the title and the epigraph, an admonition to “feel life’s sweet caress.”</p>
