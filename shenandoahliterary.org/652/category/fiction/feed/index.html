								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
<p>When our daughter was four, she pushed half a turquoise crayon so far up her nose that Paul had to take her to the pediatrician, who removed it with tweezers. For a while the story was good for cocktail parties and playground conversations, but I’d forgotten about it for years, until I got the phone call about my sister.</p>
<p>When I hung up the phone, Paul paused from stirring the penang laksa on the stove and held out the spoon.</p>
<p>“You’re not going to believe this,” I said.</p>
<p>He drank the spoonful himself and wiped his hands on a dish towel. “Try me.”</p>
<p>The call had been from a hospital administrator in Sarasota, Florida, where my sister Laura lived. Apparently Laura had been admitted to the hospital for swallowing no fewer than nine foreign bodies.</p>
<p>“What do you mean, foreign bodies?”</p>
<p>“I was getting to that.” He knows I hate to be interrupted. “Stuff you shouldn’t swallow.”</p>
<p>“Like a crayon?”</p>
<p>“Or like staples, nail files, batteries, and small knives. All of which Laura swallowed.”</p>
<p>“What the fuck?” said Paul, then he looked around to make sure our children hadn’t heard.</p>
<p>The nine foreign bodies were in her stomach and digestive tract. The doctors were going to remove the sharpest ones, and the battery, tomorrow—endoscopically.</p>
<p>“Endoscopy is when they stick a tube down your throat and pull the objects out,” I said before he could ask. “If they can’t retrieve any that way, they’ll have to perform surgery.”</p>
<p>Paul sat down next to me. He had a slight beard tan line where he had recently shaved. He smelled like ginger and kaffir lime. “Why would anyone do that?”</p>
<p>I didn’t have an answer. And the worst part was, according to the hospital, this wasn’t the first time Laura had done such a thing. She’d been admitted to the hospital for swallowing foreign bodies six times in the past two years. On the hospital forms, she had listed me as her next of kin, but she had written down the wrong phone number. Only now, on her sixth visit, had she mentioned that her brother lived in Santa Fe, and when they inquired about me, she boasted that I was a lawyer and showed them my business card. The woman on the phone wanted to know if she had ever had a therapist. Laura was resisting all psychiatric care.</p>
<p>I hadn’t seen Laura since our mother’s funeral two years ago. Sure, she had seemed sad, but hadn’t we all?</p>
<p>We were supposed to go on vacation next week, to Mexico, Paul, me, and the kids. I’d been working too much. The kids were on summer break. Paul and I needed some time together. We hadn’t been abroad in years, since China, when we endured that nightmarish maze of international adoption. Paul had wanted to go to southeast Asia—he’d been talking about some crazy kite festival in Bali—but I could only take a week off, and frankly, all I wanted to do was a lie on a beach with a bottomless margarita.</p>
<p>“What should I do?”</p>
<p>“You could always go to Florida,” said Paul, “and then meet me and the kids in Cancun.”</p>
<p>After Paul went to bed I held a pen in front of my face. I didn’t see how it was feasible to swallow. I stuck it in my mouth, but I just gagged. So I googled it. You have to lean your head back when you open your mouth, creating a straight channel from your mouth down your throat. I leaned my head back and tried again. The pen did slide right down my throat. I yanked it out, suddenly fearful it would drop. I thought about swallowing something smaller and more benign, like a coin, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it. Instead I carried a phantom pen around inside of me until I fell asleep.Three days later when I stepped out of the Tampa airport at dusk, the humidity engulfed me. I preferred the dryness of New Mexico; no matter how hot it was during the day, when the sun went down, the air cooled. Back in Florida, I was struck by the tackiness of the palm trees—palm trees and concrete always seemed a depressing combination. By the time I got my rental car and reached the outskirts of Sarasota, clouds had gathered. When I pulled into my sister’s driveway, lightning dissected the sky.</p>
<p>Laura’s apartment complex was a ramshackle affair on the edge of an abandoned lot. I couldn’t see the ocean, but I could smell it—a salty smell, the odor of rotting seaweed. When Laura opened the door and unlocked the chain, she looked the same. I don’t know why I expected her to look different—crazier, perhaps? She was tan but not what we used to call “extra crispy”, wearing a peach housedress with her hair in a lazy french twist.</p>
<p>“Petey,” she said, throwing her arms around me. She was stronger than she looked. “I’m so glad you’re here. How was your flight?”</p>
<p>Inside, Laura’s paintings of surreal landscapes dominated the walls. Scattered amongst her rattan furniture and braided rugs were some items from our late parents’ house—the faded leather loveseat, our mother’s collection of porcelain cats. I gave Laura a small wreath of dried red chilies I’d bought at the Santa Fe airport gift shop. Her eyes widened with surprise. “Oh, you shouldn’t have,” she said, smiling as though I had just given her a million bucks or one of my kidneys. She draped it around a long-necked porcelain Siamese. “It’s so beautiful.”</p>
<p>She served me sweet tea and offered me a cigarette, which I declined for a full five minutes before I caved. I hadn’t smoked in almost a decade—not since Paul and I adopted the kids—but I felt as though I had entered a time warp, walked back into an earlier version of myself. Laura had given me my first cigarette when she was sixteen and I was twelve. She opened the window wider and together we smoked as rain pummeled the house.</p>
<p>She asked about the kids. She always sent them a birthday card, but sometimes she got their ages wrong, and sometimes she forgot to get a card, just sent a twenty dollar bill and a post-it note with a heart. I told her that Kendall liked her gymnastics class. She wanted a gymnastics-themed party for her tenth birthday. We weren’t sure what that entailed—everyone in leotards? Fake gold medal party favors? Kyle seemed to have a penchant for science. Paul and I had given him a microscope for Christmas, and we had feared he would abandon it after a few days, but every day he found something new to dissect, from a cactus pear to a carpet fiber.</p>
<p>“And Paul?” she asked. “How’s that hunk of a house husband?”</p>
<p>I told her he was good. He played a lot of tennis, lucky bastard. He wanted to visit southeast Asia, but since we couldn’t actually go, he’d been cooking up a banquet of cuisines from all over the region. Every day I’d come home to an odd-looking fruit nestled in between the apples and pears: a lychee, or a durian, or a mangosteen.</p>
<p>“Why can’t you go?” Laura had tucked her knees into her chest, her feet on the chair. Smoke curled around her. She always managed to look wistful.</p>
<p>I told her I couldn’t get enough time off work, that the airfare alone was a fortune, that we had to think about the kids’ college funds.</p>
<p>Laura stood and produced a bottle of vodka from the freezer. She poured some into our tumblers of sweet tea. “Paul’s been talking about Southeast Asia for years. I remember one Thanksgiving when he was trying to convince Dad that going to Vietnam was a good idea.” She pursed her lips. The rain stopped—it had been one of those fleeting summer storms. “If you want to go, you should go. You can do anything you set your mind to.”</p>
<p>I wondered what Dad would think of this situation, if he were still alive. I pictured his stern face, Mom’s quiet tears. I looked at Laura as though I had x-ray vision, imagining the outline of a pen or a small pair of scissors glowing under her skin.<br />
“And how are you?” I asked, trying to sound upbeat. I helped myself to another cigarette. “How’s the insurance business?”</p>
<p>Laura held up her arms and laughed. “It pays for this little piece of paradise.” She boasted that she had sold some of her paintings to a local motel. Honeymooners-on-a-budget might be consummating their marriage under her abstract depictions of a sandpiper or a sunset.</p>
<p>“Hey,” she said, looking at me intently. “You should let me paint you.”</p>
<p>I shook my head and asked her how the procedure at the hospital had gone.<br />
“Fine,” she said, her face suddenly slack. I couldn’t bring myself to ask her why she did it. When she was seventeen, she had eloped with her high school boyfriend and six months later came sulking back to complete her GED. Dad offered to pay for college but not art school, so her next boyfriend, a much older man who owned a questionable car dealership, footed the bill. She was twice-divorced by twenty-five. If she couldn’t find someone to support her, she found work, but she changed jobs whenever she got bored or got fired. Twenty-odd years later, she still hadn’t settled down. In our generous moods, we had described her as artsy, bohemian, otherwise just plain wild. Had we been oblivious—had my sister been suffering from mental illness her entire life?</p>
<p>We drank vodka and sweet tea out of our parents’ old mugs and watched the local news, mocking the weather forecaster and her obvious cleavage. The next day was Monday. I had made appointments with three different therapists. I planned to get my sister’s future treatment sorted, spend one more quality evening here, and then find my ass parked next to the Mexican surf in a lounge chair—or maybe a hammock—by Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Before going to bed, I scanned the kitchen counter. A bottle opener, a chopstick, the sharp tab of a soda can—everything was a threat. I hugged Laura close. I asked, “Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“I had a tough week.” She pushed me off and fussed with the sheet and pillows on the pull-out couch bed. The ceiling fan was broken, so she gave me her box fan. “Anything else you need?”</p>
<p>After she went to bed, I continued to look up personality disorders on my phone. According to all the sources I could find, these patients were notoriously difficult to treat. Nearly all diagnosed patients were women. Nearly all suffered from early childhood trauma.</p>
<p>I remembered my childhood as happy, at least as happy as a gay kid growing up in the Redneck Riviera could be. Our parents moved to Pensacola when Laura was a toddler and my mom was pregnant with me. Our father worked on the naval air station, and our mother was a substitute teacher. They were stern but loving and very forgiving that neither of their children turned out the way they had imagined them to be. I remember riding bikes and catching lizards and watching Saturday morning cartoons. Before Pensacola, my family had lived on Whidbey Island, Washington, the opposite end of the country, where my father had worked on another navy base. Our parents didn’t talk about it much except to complain about the winters. They seemed grateful to be on the warm shores of the gulf. Had something happened to my sister in Washington? Or had something happened in Pensacola, right under my nose?</p>
<p>As I closed my eyes and tried to fall asleep, the box fan hummed. I remembered playing with Laura as a child, kneeling behind a fan and speaking slowly, pretending to be Darth Vader. I shivered as I remembered her favorite line. <em>You underestimate the power of the dark side</em>.</p>
<p>At the first therapist’s office, I flipped through an issue of Men’s Health, occasionally checking my work email and feeling sorry for myself. My mouth still felt ashy from the cigarettes the night before. Paul texted a photo of the kids at the hotel’s breakfast buffet; their glasses of orange juice had cocktail umbrellas. I wondered how long their happiness could remain so simple. I wondered how long I could shield them from the world. I looked sideways at the other people in the waiting room, wondering what was wrong with them. Were they simply depressed, or could there be a psychopath among them?</p>
<p>When Laura came into the waiting room she smiled weakly and brushed past me.<br />
In the parking lot she trembled as she lit a cigarette. “He didn’t like me.”</p>
<p>I leaned against the rental car. “I’m sure that’s not true.”</p>
<p>“He spoke to me as if I were a child. He acted like I was mentally handicapped. Do I give that impression?”</p>
<p>I shook my head. In her slacks and sleeveless blouse, she looked like a fully functioning adult. I reminded her that we had two more appointments, that we’d find a better fit. I didn’t tell her how hard it was to get those appointments on such short notice, the legal jargon I had to throw around to convince the receptionists to squeeze us in.</p>
<p>It was a clear day; there was no sign of the previous night’s storm. We drove down palm-lined streets, past strip malls and parking garages. All the buildings were white. There was a lot of glass, floor-to-ceiling windows, reflecting more white buildings, more palm trees. The sun hurt my eyes.</p>
<p>We drove out to Siesta Key for lunch. As we ate hamburgers, Laura stared vacantly across the room, blinking when the waitress asked her if she wanted a refill on her coke. Afterwards we got ice cream cones and walked out to the beach. I started to take off my shoes, but Laura stopped me. “The sand’s too hot.”</p>
<p>I asked her if she wanted to try my mint chip, and she smiled. “You just want to try my black raspberry. You never could make up your mind.” We sampled each other’s ice creams and walked along the water’s edge. According to Laura, Sarasota was a tourist trap in the winter, but for the most part only the locals braved the summer climate. A handful of people were out sunbathing, and a couple of kids squealed and splashed each other in the water. Across the gulf, in Mexico, my children were frolicking in the same body of water, although Paul would have probably gotten them to do something more organized like snorkeling or stand-up paddle boarding.</p>
<p>Laura seemed more relaxed. The bright sun dulled all the colors except the lustrous blue of the ocean. The heat seemed to stifle all sounds: the lazy shush of the tide seemed a million miles away. We walked as if in a dream.</p>
<p>We paused at the stone pilings of a washed-away pier. I cleared my throat. “You know, you can talk to me.” Laura nodded and let her eyes drift to the horizon. I walked to the water’s edge and kicked at the wet sand, unearthing sand crabs that frantically burrowed back down again.</p>
<p>“Did something happen when you were a kid?” I asked. Laura continued to stare out across the water. “Did something happen on Whidbey Island?”</p>
<p>She bent over to pluck a shell from the sand. She held it up, a pink and white clamshell. “I don’t remember anything before Pensacola. I told you, I was having a bad week.” She squinted and held her hands over her eyes to examine the shell.<br />
I wanted to poke her, the way we did when we were kids on a road trip to Savannah or Daytona Beach, until Mom yelled no touching! and then I would hover my hand a half inch above her arms or legs, a half inch in front of her face. Not touching, can’t get mad, not touching, can’t get mad I would chant, and she would exhibit zen-like patience until the moment she didn’t, lashing out to slap my hand away or pinch my arm. One time she elbowed me in the eye. I had a black eye for a week.</p>
<p>I wanted her to to hurt me and not herself.</p>
<p>“A bad week? You have a bad week, and you swallow a couple of batteries?”</p>
<p>She shrugged. “It was only one battery.”</p>
<p>The sea looked impossibly big, and this was only the gulf. I couldn’t imagine how the old explorers embarked on a journey across the Atlantic, not sure what they would find on the other side, not sure they would find the other side at all.</p>
<p>I sighed, loudly, the way our father would have. “But they said you’d been to the hospital six times in the past two years.”</p>
<p>Laura frowned. “They must have gotten me mixed up with someone else. There’s no way I went six times.”</p>
<p>“How many times?”</p>
<p>She bent again, producing another clamshell, what could have been the first’s other half. She held them together, but they didn’t quite fit.</p>
<p>“I should tell you something. My car’s not in the shop.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean? Where is it?”</p>
<p>“It got totaled. It was the other driver’s fault, but I can’t prove it, and the police were no help, and I was behind on my insurance payments.”</p>
<p>“But you work for an insurance company.”</p>
<p>“I did.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Carol in HR always had it out for me.”</p>
<p>“Why would Carol in HR have it out for you?”</p>
<p>She shrugged. “She was always harassing me for this form or that form. I think she had a thing for Dale in the cubicle next to me. Dale and I were just friends.”<br />
“You don’t have a car or a job.” I digested the information as I said the words aloud. “How are you paying your bills?” By the time I finished the question, I knew the answer. Our parents had been hard workers, but they had not invested wisely, and our inheritance wasn’t much. “How much do you have left?”</p>
<p>“I’m good until the end of the month.”</p>
<p>“Oh Laura.” I grabbed her hand and squeezed. “Why didn’t you let me know sooner that you were in trouble?”</p>
<p>She shook her head. “You know me, I always land on my feet.”</p>
<p>I tried to look her in the eye, but she kept looking down, fiddling with the shells. “The last time I saw you was at the funeral,” I said. “We were all grieving. I’m sorry if I didn’t notice something I should have noticed.”</p>
<p>She turned her gaze back to the sea. When she was younger, she used to have auburn hair to her waist. Now her shoulder-length hair was brittle, and her roots were graying. She was slim, but the skin at the edge of her jaw was starting to fold. How did we get from point A to point B, from being young to being old? From being siblings to being strangers?</p>
<p>“I miss Mom,” she said. A white sailboat appeared a few hundred meters from shore, but there was no breeze. How had the boat gotten there? Laura tossed the clamshells into the water. “Now that she’s gone, how can I win her approval?”</p>
<p>I frowned. She laughed. “Jesus, can’t you take a joke?”</p>
<p>I grabbed her shoulders. Her eyes were glassy. “You could have died. Six times in two years, you could have died. So at this moment, no, I cannot take a joke.”</p>
<p>“Oh Petey,” she said, putting my face in her hands. “You worry too much. You always did.”</p>
<p>On the way to therapist number two, I told Laura I’d give her the money for next month’s rent. That night, I’d get her started on looking for a new job. I told her she could come visit whenever she wanted. The kids could bunk together, and she could have Kendall’s room. But the most important thing was to get treatment. I made her promise me that she’d give it a chance.</p>
<p>At the second therapist’s office, I thought about Mom and Dad. Had they known something? Was there a long-lost uncle or babysitter on Whidbey Island, and the truth was so ugly they thought it best to ignore? Or was Laura just wired differently—had they been bewildered by their daughter’s mood swings, her reckless choices? I flipped through a months-old issue of the Economist, dismayed at the international disasters I’d failed to observe at the time. Earthquakes, hostile takeovers, spiraling debt. Horrible events were unfolding all the time, out of sight, out of mind.</p>
<p>I shut the magazine. I wanted a cigarette. I stood and got some water from the cooler, finishing the little plastic cupful in one swig and pouring another. For the prices this therapist charged, you would think she could afford real glasses.</p>
<p>Paul texted another photo—the kids on the beach, their wet hair plastered to their heads, their arms slung around each other. I knew there were pictures of me and Laura like that, before she grew haughty and I self-conscious. I hoped our children would continue to be close when they grew up. So what if they weren’t tied together by blood?</p>
<p>I studied the photo. They seemed happy, but how could we know for sure? The first months of their lives must have been traumatic for them to arrive at a Chinese orphanage. What if they were suppressing a horrible experience—how might that affect them for the rest of their lives?</p>
<p>I switched the <em>Economist</em> out for a <em>People</em> magazine and wasted the next twenty minutes of my life looking at celebrities caught wearing sweatpants or walking their dogs, things that normal people do everyday without such derision or praise.<br />
When Laura emerged from this session, she was smiling.</p>
<p>“This one was better?”</p>
<p>She shrugged. I knew that look, that guilty smirk. The therapist—Serena, she’d insisted on being called—appeared in the doorway, frowning. She walked over to us.</p>
<p>“Peter Wilks? This is your sister?” She crossed her arms. She wore a baggy blazer and olive pants. Static electricity caused one strand of her hair to hover an inch in front of the rest. I suddenly felt bad for my sister. I wouldn’t want to tell this person my problems.</p>
<p>Serena sighed. “Your sister just swallowed my pen. A Montblanc. That’s a three-hundred dollar pen.”</p>
<p>Laura shrugged. “I don’t know what she&#8217;s talking about.”</p>
<p>Serena did not look serene. She put her hands on her hips. “My pen was sitting on my desk, in plain view. I went to the window to open the blinds, and when I turn around, Laura is standing over my desk, and the pen is gone.”</p>
<p>“Maybe you misplaced it,” said Laura. “I’m always misplacing my keys, even if I’m sure I put them back.”</p>
<p>“Let me get this straight,” I said to Serena. “You didn’t see her swallow your pen?”<br />
Serena bit her lip. “When you’re ready to admit you have a problem, you can begin to make progress.”</p>
<p>In the parking lot, we leaned against the rental car, smoking, careful not to let our bare arms touch the hot car.</p>
<p>“Why’d you do it?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t think it was possible,” said Laura, “but she was even worse than the first one.”</p>
<p>“Do you know how ridiculous this seems? You can’t keep doing this.”</p>
<p>Laura frowned. “It’s like she pretended to be my friend. I don’t need to pay someone to be my friend.”</p>
<p>“You’re right,” I said. “You don’t have to. I paid her.”</p>
<p>She took one more drag then tossed her cigarette to the ground. She got into the passenger seat. I finished my cigarette, picked up her cigarette butt, and deposited them both in a trash can at the edge of the lot. When I got back to the car, Laura grimaced.</p>
<p>“Peter?” she said. “I don’t feel so good.”</p>
<p>When we finally got back to Laura’s place, I stayed outside to call Paul and the kids. I was reluctant to leave her alone, but even if Laura swallowed something else, they’d take another x-ray in the morning. Tonight clouds loomed, swollen, but there was no lightning, no thunder. Somewhere nearby, cicadas were buzzing.</p>
<p>First I talked to the kids. Kendall told me about kayaking in the mangroves, about one place where the overlapping branches made a tunnel. Kyle described the turtle they saw underwater, how it swam along beside them. Did I know that turtles had been around since the time of the dinosaurs? At home I always felt like I was nagging them to stop playing computer games, to eat their vegetables, to use inside voices. It was nice to hear them so free and lighthearted. I wished I could be there with them.</p>
<p>Then I filled Paul in. After the incident at the therapist’s office, we had gone to the hospital, and an x-ray had revealed, in addition to the pen, a toothbrush, two nails, and three safety pins. The hospital staff was polite but brusque. The doctor on call explained that the psychiatric staff couldn’t diagnose her without more careful monitoring—perhaps in dialogue with a therapist that she saw regularly—but if she continued to be a danger to herself, we should consider full-time residential care.</p>
<p>I apologized to Paul for missing more of our vacation. I wasn’t going to make my morning flight if I stuck around for Laura’s next procedure.</p>
<p>“This is not a legal case you have to solve. This is your sister.” Paul came from a big midwestern family of Norwegian descent. At Christmas, our mantle was covered with photos of blonde, strong-jawed children. I had expected him to laugh about the three-hundred dollar pen, but he was completely somber. “Take all the time you need.”</p>
<p>I told him she was out of money. I asked him if he thought it was a coincidence that she gave them my real phone number now. Was this a cry for help, or a cry for financial help?</p>
<p>“Don’t be so cynical. It’s not attractive.” I hated when Paul scolded me. “I think she did it this time so that you would have to stay. She needs you.”</p>
<p>“I need a vacation.”</p>
<p>“I know,” said Paul. “But this is more important.”</p>
<p>“That’s easy for you to say. You’re on vacation all the time.”</p>
<p>Paul was silent.</p>
<p>“Just kidding, honey.” I said in the high voice I use when I know he’s mad.</p>
<p>“Are you?”</p>
<p>“For chrissake,” I said, “Let’s not fight.”</p>
<p>“Sure. Avoid the problem. It really works for you, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>I hadn’t avoided Laura. I had taken care of all the details of our mother’s estate. I had made sure Laura got her fair share. She was my big sister, and she rarely contacted me. If our parents never noticed she had a mental health issue, how was I supposed to know?</p>
<p>I hung up and rescheduled my flight and our appointment with the third therapist. Inside, I sat on our parent’s old leather loveseat while Laura and I ate delivery pizza and played Scrabble. I made the longer and more esoteric words, but Laura knew how to game the system, scoring double and triple-point letters and words. She laughed and cheered during her turns and goaded me during mine.</p>
<p>We ran out of sweet tea, so Laura drank vodka directly from the bottle. I said we should take it easy, considering she had to go back to the hospital in the morning. She flashed me a wide smile. “This is taking it easy.”</p>
<p>When she beat me the second time, she clapped her hands together and announced it was time to paint me.</p>
<p>“I’m losing my hair. I’m getting fat.” I took the bottle of vodka and poured some into my tumbler, then went to the freezer for some ice.</p>
<p>“Stop being a baby. Sit.”</p>
<p>I sipped my vodka while she readied her canvas, brushes, and paint. I studied the paintings on her walls—smears of red and smoky orange, the dim outline of a sun, as though the world were on fire.</p>
<p>“Can I move? You know, to ash my cigarette?”</p>
<p>She nodded. “Sure. I just need to get your essence.”</p>
<p>My essence. If I were sober, I might have laughed her off. But suddenly, determining my essence seemed urgent. Who was I? At work I specialized in commercial law, drafting contracts and protecting the business interests of my clients. Sure, I took some satisfaction out of wading through documents, spotting errors and plugging holes, but was that my essence? Anal-retentive-ness?</p>
<p>I was a husband and a father, a provider. But Paul was restless. What was up with his on-again, off-again beard? Who was he trying to impress? I put food on the table, but I had missed all but one of Kendall’s gymnastics meets, and it was Paul who had helped Kyle make the potato battery for his second-place-winning science fair project. When the kids had a bad dream, whose side of the bed did they go to?</p>
<p>Laura perched behind her easel, her brush sweeping the canvas, her tongue poised between her lips. I wondered what she saw in me.</p>
<p>“How’s it going?” I said. “Be kind.”</p>
<p>She frowned. “When I paint, I’m honest.”</p>
<p>I rolled my eyes. “Well, then I’m fucked.”</p>
<p>Her hands were splattered with paint; she swept the hair out of her face with her wrist. “What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>I drained my glass, sucked at the ice cubes. I suddenly remembered it was hot.</p>
<p>“Nothing.”</p>
<p>“Don’t lie,” she said. “I can always tell when you’re lying.”</p>
<p>I refilled my glass. “I’ve been working too much.”</p>
<p>“Your work and home life are out of balance,” she said, nodding.</p>
<p>“Don’t give me any of that new age crap,” I said.</p>
<p>“You’re exhausted,” she continued. “Paul’s feeling neglected. I’ve been through this. It’s awful.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t fathom any of her relationships had been as deep as my connection with Paul, but I didn’t want to offend her.</p>
<p>“It is. It feels like I can never do enough.”</p>
<p>She smiled sympathetically.</p>
<p>I tried to blow smoke rings and managed a few. “Did you see that?”</p>
<p>But she was suddenly focused on my portrait, painting a long slow line then jabbing at the canvas like some kind of martial artist.</p>
<p>I watched the end of my cigarette glow. “And I don’t know what’s up with Southeast Asia. Why doesn’t he want to visit China, where our children are from? Is he afraid, deep down, that our children will never fully belong to us? That if they visit their homeland, they’ll somehow sense the gulf between us more clearly?”</p>
<p>Laura stabbed at the canvas a few more times. “No man is an island,” she said.<br />
“Who said that? What a fucking idiot.” She took back the vodka bottle and took a swig. “We’re all islands.” She put down her brush. The cicadas continued to whine.</p>
<p>“Did you hear about that woman who committed suicide by jumping into an alligator pond?”</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>“She was sixty-five. I think that’s rather beautiful. That’s the way to go, if you’re going to go.”</p>
<p>She picked up her brush but held it in the air. “I don’t know if I can keep doing this.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to,” I said.</p>
<p>“Not that,” she said. “Not the painting.”</p>
<p>“What, then?”</p>
<p>She spread her arms and looked up towards the ceiling. The cicadas had gotten louder. Their singing filled the room. “Living.”</p>
<p>After she went to bed, I studied the painting. My essence was blue and green, a morose ocean swirling in an unfinished face. I wondered if Laura had any friends from her old jobs, if she had spoken to anyone since getting fired. I pictured her moping around inside this apartment for the past month, making these depressing paintings. I wondered how long you could have a pen or knife inside of you before the pain became unbearable. The previous six times Laura had ingested foreign bodies, she had checked herself into the hospital. Then, too, she had complained of abdominal pain, not admitting what she’d done, waiting for the x-ray for the big reveal. I wondered if she craved the attention, the nurses speaking in concerned tones, the doctors taking care of her.</p>
<p>In the morning, after a fitful sleep, I cleaned up the pizza box and greasy plates as Laura got dressed. My head pounded. I drank a pint of water and took some Ibuprofen. Laura put on lipstick, wiped it off, then reapplied a brighter shade. When we got to the car, she slumped in the front seat, her frown a brilliant fuschia.</p>
<p>“I know this is hard for you,” I said. “You’re being really brave.”</p>
<p>I started to drive. The rental car started beeping, at first slowly, and then with an increasingly frenetic tempo. “ Can you put your seatbelt on?” I asked.</p>
<p>She sighed. “Don’t patronize me.”</p>
<p>“I’m not patronizing you.”</p>
<p>“Yes you are.”</p>
<p>She buckled up, and we drove the rest of the way to the hospital in silence. When we pulled into the hospital parking lot, she didn’t move.</p>
<p>“Let’s go,” I said. “You can do this.”</p>
<p>“You always patronize me.” She looked at her lap. “You always act like you’re better than me.” She raised her voice. “You’re always bragging about your fancy job and your big fancy house and complaining about your stupid mortgage and college funds. You love to rub it in my face that you are happily married, that a big queer can land a husband better than I can.”</p>
<p>In front of the car, an old man with a walker and his nurse’s aid stopped and peered at us.</p>
<p>She glared at me. “Sometimes I think everyone else is happy, that I’m the only one who’s miserable.” Her nostrils flared. “But then I realized something. No one is happy. It’s all a facade. There’s something wrong with that white picket bullshit life of yours, with your kids that aren’t even yours.”</p>
<p>“We don’t have a white picket fence,” I said, leaning my head back against the headrest. “We have a cactus garden.”</p>
<p>Laura got out of the car. She walked away from the hospital, out the parking lot and onto the sidewalk. I started the car and caught up to her. I drove slowly and opened the window.</p>
<p>“Get in the car,” I said.</p>
<p>She kept walking.</p>
<p>“Get in the car.”</p>
<p>She picked up the pace.</p>
<p>I leaned out the window and yelled, “Where do you think you’re going?”</p>
<p>“Home.”</p>
<p>“We have to go back to the hospital. You can’t walk home.”</p>
<p>“Sure I can. I’ve done it before.”</p>
<p>According to the GPS, it was just over three miles. She walked fast, her elbows jabbing the air with each stride.</p>
<p>At the intersection, I sped up. I wished I’d never come, that I’d gone to Mexico, that I’d gone snorkeling with my children, that I’d gotten to relax with my husband, that I could have time to be the kind of man my family loved, not just the one they needed. I was tired of being the responsible one.</p>
<p>But the further I drove, the more anxious I got. What if Laura did something stupid? There wasn’t an alligator farm in Sarasota, I hoped. I circled around and drove back, but she wasn’t on the same street. I double checked the GPS and followed an alternate route to her house for a mile before I gave up. I phoned the hospital, but she hadn’t shown up there. Where could she be?</p>
<p>I wished that we had that identical twin spidey-sense, that if I thought about her hard enough, I’d sense her presence. I looked up alligator farms and called a place called Sarasota Jungle Gardens. The employee I spoke to assured me the few alligators they had weren’t big enough to kill anyone. Still, I gave him her description, and he promised to call me if she showed up. The only other place I could think of was her old office, the insurance company. I looked it up—it was less than ten blocks from the hospital. If she wasn’t there, I’d call the cops.</p>
<p>The office was in a strip mall, sandwiched between a Wendy’s and a Men’s Wearhouse. When I stepped inside, a bell on the door jingled, but there was no one at reception. On the wall hung a poster of a snow-covered mountain with the caption: “Don’t stop when you’re tired. Stop when you’re done.” Somewhere in another room people were yelling. I turned the corner and saw a crowd of office workers with their hands raised. At the center was my sister, her shirt rumpled, her hair wild. All around her on the floor lay file folders and papers. The woman yelling at Laura was bottle-blonde and leathery-tan: extra crispy. Laura was yelling back at almost the exact same pitch—for a moment, it sounded as though they were on the same side, part of a throaty Slavic choir. Around them the other workers continued to flap their arms helplessly.</p>
<p>I stepped in. “Laura,” I said, taking her arm. “Let’s go.”</p>
<p>“Do you know this woman?” said Extra Crispy.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” I said. “We’re leaving.” I tugged at Laura, but she resisted, demonstrating that wiry strength that came out of nowhere.</p>
<p>“You still owe me my last week’s wages,” Laura said.</p>
<p>Extra Crispy turned to me. “Can’t you get rid of this crazy bitch?”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?” I said.</p>
<p>Extra Crispy frowned. She was actually wearing blue eye shadow. I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>“Fuck you, Carol,” said Laura. She worked her jaw. The tendons in her throat bulged. “Fuck you forever.”</p>
<p>I held Laura back. I looked at Extra Crispy/Carol, at her watery eyes, her husk of a face. I lifted my hand, and with my index finger I poked her sun-spotted chest. “My sister might be crazy,” I said, “but you’re obviously the bitch.” I lowered my voice.</p>
<p>“She better get that check in the mail,” I said, all business, “unless you want to get sued. I’m her lawyer.”</p>
<p>I led Laura back to reception and out the door. In the car, she grinned at me and pulled a wadded-up piece of paper out of her purse. “Carol’s address,” she said. “I got her file.”</p>
<p>“Laura!”</p>
<p>She giggled. “Come on,” she said. “It will be fun.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“You were always such a goody-goody. Live a little, for Chrissake.”</p>
<p>“We have to get you back.”</p>
<p>“To what?” she said. “To what?”</p>
<p>I thought of the hospital and the kind but exasperated nurses. I thought of the therapists, the veneer of concern that coated every word. I thought of Laura’s apartment, reeking of dead things from the sea, those porcelain cats with their scratched noses and chipped tails.</p>
<p>I punched the address into the GPS, and Laura lit the evidence on fire with the end of her cigarette. The ashes blew out the window.</p>
<p>Later, I’d have a hard time explaining to the police, and maybe even a harder time explaining to Paul, why we’d stopped at the Texaco to buy nine dozen eggs—cleaned them out of eggs. How could I describe the feeling that accompanied the flinging of said eggs—the smack and splatter of yolk that dripped down the front door, the stucco walls, and the windows of Carol’s single-story house in a subdivision called Dolphin Dreams? How could I describe the triumphant arc the toilet paper made as it spiraled through the air, the almost elegant loops it draped around the lone tree in the front yard? We were united. It was as though we had been transported back in time to perform the perfect teenage prank, a simple remedy for all the ways we had been wronged. We heard a siren in the distance, but we couldn’t stop ourselves. We tossed and flung until there was nothing left, and then we lay on the prickly grass of her overgrown lawn, panting, waiting for whatever came next.</p>
<p>“You found me,” said Laura. “You saved me.”</p>
<p>One summer, when we were kids, our neighbors went out of town and lent us their Nintendo. Laura was too old for video games at that point. She was probably off on illicit dates, shoplifting beer and flirting with pregnancy. But I spent the next few months dodging mushrooms and flying turtles, hitting bricks and collecting coins, bouncing through tree tops and charging through castles, helping Mario ascend from one world to the next in order to save the princess. I spent most of my waking hours playing, and when our parents went to bed, I would sneak out of my room and play the game on mute. Even then, I knew I didn’t like girls, and when I thought about saving a princess, the only girl I could fathom wanting to save was my sister.</p>
<p>The night I tried to swallow something sharp, the night I carried the phantom pen inside of me—it did feel strangely reassuring, like a secret that belonged to me and me alone. Maybe Laura was wrong. Maybe we aren’t islands. Maybe she was knowable. Maybe we could rewind, start over. In the video game, no matter how often your character died, you could always begin again. At first, passing each level was difficult, a gauntlet of unforeseen threats. But once you got the hang of it, each world was not so different from the ones that came before.</p>
<p>Overhead, the sun continued to beat cheerfully, mercilessly. Laura flung her arms in the air and hooted with pleasure. I tried to picture the foreign bodies inside her: the overpriced pen, the toothbrush, the nails and safety pins. On the x-ray they had looked ghostly, suspended in space, her own little arsenal perched between her rib cage and pelvis.</p>
<p>But in front of me I could only see my flesh-and-blood sister, laughing so hard she was crying. For the time being, we lay on our backs and high-fived each other, our fingers slick with raw egg. We shared our last cigarette, blowing smoke rings that lasted a few seconds before thinning into the sky as we waited for the cops to come, as we waited for a punishment we knew we could endure.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This, Margaret thought, was the perfect night for a walk in the forest. How fortunate that she had already agreed to be there.</p>
<p>Goody Price had died earlier that night, strangled by the rope as she protested her innocence and spat curses at those who sentenced her. Margaret had to laugh at the idea that people she used to think of as smart could believe anyone as dumb as the schoolteacher was a witch. Surely, a real witch could have used her powers to avoid the painful experience of hanging, or the posthumous insult of having her flesh slowly turned into nothing but burnt meat. Goody Price hadn’t even been smart enough to snap her neck rather than suffocate.</p>
<p>Once she felt certain that she was alone, Margaret slung her bag over her shoulder and crept out to the forest on the edge of town. Nobody paid much attention to orphans, and she knew better than most how to avoid detection. It had become a particularly useful skill of late.</p>
<p>The noise from the woods seemed incidental when it started. Whatever it was moved through the foliage at a slow pace, but not so slowly that Margaret didn’t notice it. She gave the whistle that always served as a signal, and the form in the bushes came closer. From what she could tell of its size and movement, it could have been any animal, and its eyes glowed in the darkness.</p>
<p>Margaret checked her surroundings, making sure she was deep enough into the forest that nobody on patrol would see her, and that none of the other children had seen her and tried to follow. “I come alone,” she said, in a voice just above a whisper. “I have brought what I promised.”</p>
<p>She whistled again, and the animal emerged from the bushes, revealing itself as a large fox. The animal’s fur was red around the legs and underbelly, with silver atop its head and along its back, and a black tail ending in a white tip. The fox walked up to Margaret and sat still, wrapping its tail around its paws and scanning the forest from side to side.</p>
<p>“Here it is,” Margaret said, reaching into the bag she’d brought, and removing several chunks of cooked meat. “I had to wait until the town watch went to bed before I could collect it.” The fox’s stomach rumbled when it smelled the offering, and the animal licked its chops with relish.</p>
<p>Margaret arranged the pieces in the usual pattern. When she finished, she looked up at the full moon and chanted the now-familiar incantation. The fox ate everything she had brought, even gnawing the marrow from what remained of Goody Price’s bones. Margaret had known the schoolteacher had become suspicious of her, and the girl found relief watching the fox erase the last evidence of such suspicion. As it fed, Margaret listened for signs of any other animals that might be drawn to the scent, but the forest was completely silent. Just like the other times.</p>
<p>When the fox was sated, it sat on its haunches and scanned the forest again. Then it spoke. “This task is now complete. Shall there be another task?”</p>
<p>Margaret nodded, and steeled herself. Even with practice, she had never lost her fear of the primeval.</p>
<p>“What, child, do you bring in payment?”</p>
<p>The girl again reached for her bag, and dumped its remaining contents on the forest floor. She had not had much time at the Price house while the town gathered at the gallows, and the late Goodman Price had not been a wealthy man. She had found a small jar of indigo, some fabric, a few apples, and a pair of candlesticks made of a shiny metal.</p>
<p>“This is quite a bit less than what you last offered.”</p>
<p>The crone had taken a different form each time Margaret met with her, appearing as a marten, a wolverine, a wolf, a bat, a hawk. Somehow, Margaret found her human form most frightening, and that was the form that now picked through the scraps of the Prices’ former lives.</p>
<p>Margaret shivered as the hunched old woman spoke. She was always careful not to make eye contact with the crone, lest her thoughts be read and controlled.</p>
<p>“Very well. Who shall it be this time?”</p>
<p>“The midwife who sometimes watches the cousins. I believe she knows too many things.”</p>
<p>“Very well. It shall be done. You shall feed me again at the full corn moon.”</p>
<p>Margaret nodded and lifted her face to look at her fellow conspirator, only to see a large, reddish grey weasel racing for the brush. It reminded her of the marten that approached her months ago, when she had thought she was crying in the forest by herself.</p>
<p>That time, the local beggar woman had seen Margaret stealing an extra share of milk, and threatened to tell everyone if she ever did it again. The scared girl ran off as soon as night fell, making sure she was alone as she entered the woods, which the town’s laws forbid children from exploring. She had said “I wish I could kill Goody Good” a few times before she heard the movement in the bushes. She was terrified that someone from town had followed her, or that the noise meant she had stumbled on Naumkeag land.</p>
<p>Instead, she was confronted by nothing more than a marten, which calmed her. Hearing a marten say, “That can be arranged,” however, was more chilling than anything the girl had feared. She hadn’t fully meant what she said, but the slender animal proved persuasive. It sounded so easy, so final. Under the light of the full moon, she found herself agreeing to terms with the hag into which the marten reshaped itself.</p>
<p>Mere days later in town, she saw the two cousins staring into the eyes of a horned owl that had a familiar appearance. It was too late to question her decision. Though the owl didn’t move its beak or produce a sound, in her head Margaret could hear the bird telling the girls that they had seen Goody Good with the devil, that the goats on which the owl had fed were killed by the old beggar woman. The girls repeated the words quietly. Soon they would repeat them to the town elders. Margaret knew the other girls would be rewarded for finding the supposed witch, but she did not need the credit.</p>
<p>She only needed the townspeople who were mean to her to leave her alone. One by one, she would make them.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When writing, I find it impossible to concern myself with the arcane rules of spelling and punctuation. The plight of the dangling participle concerns me not at all, especially when operating under the threat of death. But syntax—that’s quite another matter.</p>
<p>For me, writing has always come from reading. Words produce words, simple as that. Call me pitifully post-modern if you must, but that’s why I am currently blocked, constipated, bound-up. I am hard-pressed to find a sustainable grouping of words in any comprehensible language on this outcropping of rocks in the middle of the Aegean in October with the Meltemi coming to an end—but more on that later.</p>
<p>The summer people, those formally beautiful and deliciously trashy European languishers who populate the place from May until September, are mercifully gone, including the one who is directly responsible for my current predicament.</p>
<p>My hostess, the ancient Lady MacWorthington, widow of Lord MacWorthington and last of the stodgy old colonials, has a library of sorts. Obscure, mostly 19th-century titles in first editions are here, but she won&#8217;t let me leave the house with any. I can read all I want under her watchful eye and constant commentary and occasional hand on my thigh—she goes a little higher each day—and endless cups of black tea that run through me like the mighty Mississippi flowing unvexed to the sea.</p>
<p>There are some fascinatingly obscure titles that could be just the thing to catapult me into a creative/competitive state, which is crucial to my productivity and which, since I have aged, I find harder and harder to acquire. Other writers may do the same; I don’t know and could not care less. I never credit my muse, and it’s hardly plagiarism—more like literary drafting—when I get behind a fine, rich passage that’s moving along at a fast clip, I can grab onto its cadence, its form and plot, and especially dialogue and speech patterns, and can sustain the refrain in my own words indefinitely.</p>
<p>I use other writing not to find my voice—I have no voice. Yet I’ve a career, and quite a successful one.</p>
<p>My personal life—my experiences, family history, emotions, and anecdotes—never make their way into my writing, but when I find myself in that word-filled wind-tunnel, the sentences just flow and flow. They seldom need editing or revision. It’s magic.</p>
<p>But now I’ve lost my mojo, and that goddamn oligarch of a Russian with the 300-meter-long yacht he calls the <em>Obscenity</em> has promised to forgive my debts—and there are many—and spare my life, but only if I write the most compelling piece of prose he has read in his newly acquired language, English. (Thank God I won’t be competing with Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and he who bites the hand that fed him, Solzhenitsyn.)</p>
<p>Serge Lutz Romanov (not his real name) plans to return to these rocky shoals in late November. “We will have Thanksgiving together,” he declares, that being his new favorite holiday. I will present the fruits of my imagination, and he will decide if I live or die.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>How it came about:</p>
<p>This was my first mistake, though I made many. The four of us—Serge and one of his fancifully named and ever-present bodyguards, Molotov or Kalashnikov or something associated with a cocktail; Winslow Malaise (his real name!), a foppish, professorial type from Antioch College on sabbatical and traveling under the aegis of the Fulbright Foundation (your tax dollars at work); and I—were sitting at the posh gaming table aboard that disgusting, floating monument to wretched excess and dysfunctional capitalism, the <em>Obscenity</em>.</p>
<p>Serge had picked up this Malaise (oh, I do so love the sound of that) in a bar in Monte Carlo’s Grand Casino. They’d struck up a conversation about the Lost Generation—Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Dos Passos, and all the other insecure pencil-dick scribblers who had survived or dodged the Great War and just felt awful about it.</p>
<p>During one of my brandy-fueled diatribes aimed at the effete and feckless Malaise, I cavalierly dismissed the whole lot, especially Fitzgerald, who couldn&#8217;t recognize a good thing when he found one—Zelda, Hollywood, fame and fortune (if fleeting), rakish good looks, et cetera.</p>
<p>I came down especially hard on <em>The Crack-Up</em>, his sketchy autobiographical piece about mental instability published in that paragon of lofty intellectualism, <em>Esquire</em> magazine (circa 1936). Such whining and complaining, so weak and lily-livered.</p>
<p>“Be a man,” says I, followed by: “He gave permission to a whole phalanx of confessional writers—the contemptible Robert Lowell, the boring Ann Beatty, and that whole miserable, navel-gazing, MFA-grasping crowd that still occupies to a great extent America’s literary landscape.”</p>
<p>Malaise was nodding off and about to fall out of his overstuffed leather chair when Serge raised the pot €10,000 and gave me one of his signature squinty-eyed, Cossack stares.</p>
<p>“And you can do better?” he queried.</p>
<p>“Ha! Of course!” I shot back. “With one blind eye, the other bloodshot, and my writing hand tied behind me. I am a professional!&#8221;</p>
<p>“Well,” said Serge, “the mutilation of the eye won’t be necessary, unless of course you do not win. I like a good wager, especially when something dear is at stake. I look forward to reading your response, your treatise.”</p>
<p>“I beg your pardon?” I gasped. “Are you proposing a bet of some kind?”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course. All of your debts will be forgiven and the <em>Obscenity </em>will take you around the world if you win. If you lose, well—” He pulled a finger across his throat.</p>
<p>My pickled brain tried to make sense of this. “How will we know? Who will judge?”</p>
<p>“Why, Professor Malaise here. He has a PhD from Princeton,” Serge announced with an unearned lilt of Ivy League arrogance.</p>
<p>“Which should disqualify him,” I sputtered. “Fitzgerald went to Princeton. They deify him there. Malaise can hardly be objective.”</p>
<p>It was all for naught. The Fulbright fellow’s head was flat on the table and stirred only when Serge offered him a €10,000 fee for “literary consultation.”</p>
<p>The <em>Obscenity </em>would weigh anchor on the morrow. Malaise would stay on board to give tutorials on 20<sup>th</sup>-century American Lit until Serge, the <em>Obscenity, </em>and its entourage returned for the ultimate read-off.</p>
<p>We parted in cold silence. One thing was very clear. Should my offering not match or exceed Fitzgerald, it was lights out, so long, <em>sayonara,</em> sweet dreams, <em>adios,</em> <em>arrivederci,</em> the Big Sleep <em>pour moi!</em></p>
<p>***</p>
<p>This I knew. My nemesis had not come by his wealth passively. He had killed before, readily, and even bragged about it. After the collapse of the Soviet Union there’d been a mad scramble for assets among Russia’s would-be oligarchs. Serge Romanov and Molotov/Kalashnikov/Baryshnikov had duked it out with a small army of former Soviet intelligence officers intent on taking oil and mining interests that were a huge part of Serge’s empire. There had been casualties, and Serge would have been among them except for Molotov/Smirnoff (or whatever his goddamn name was), who had snatched Serge’s chestnuts from the fire. The two were devoted to one another, and Serge was seldom out Molotov’s sight.</p>
<p>For all of his high-profile wealth and acquisitions, Serge had powerful enemies. Now, as one of the last men standing, our not-so-benevolent host did not cotton to being challenged, contradicted, or made to look the slightest bit foolish, and unfortunately his English was getting better.</p>
<p>As I slowly came to my senses, I began to calculate my chances. Winslow Malaise had read my work in obscure literary journals and <em>The New York Review of Books</em> and claimed to have admired a <em>New York Times </em>Op-Ed on Third World writers and why they mattered. He had not read my novels or my memoir, which was probably a good thing. He did, however, fondly recall a <em>New Yorker </em>piece praising a resurgent interest in William Faulkner and why his prose soared in such a singular way, occupying a stratosphere all its own, with no need for the unnecessary burden of punctuation.</p>
<p>It occurred to me: Malaise could be finessed and would certainly have a say, but Serge would have the final word on whether I lived or died. I did not plan to go gently into that good night.</p>
<p>Turkey Day was a mere six weeks away. If I was not to be the one roasted, I must eventually get back to Lady MacWorthington’s musty library, open my thighs, make amends, and put on a charm offensive to all I had offended—and there had been many.</p>
<p>I agonized for weeks on end. When I next called on the Grande Dame, I found by the door a stack of old books (is there any other kind?) to be donated to the Red Cross. When I reached down, fate filled my hand with a copy of <em>Big Woods</em>, a 1937 edition of William Faulkner’s hunting stories. Faulkner! What was it about this tiny man with the outsized vision?</p>
<p>I met him, you know, in the winter of 1962, at West Point. That’s right—I was destined for a military career but instead followed in the path of such distinguished dropouts as J.M. Whistler and E.A. Poe, who both fled that fortress on the Hudson as soon as they could flunk out. But one February morning, in my English class, reading from his work, was William Faulkner along with Henri Cartier-Bresson, who was busy snapping photographs. There is one of the Great Man and me; his high-pitched voice haunts me still.</p>
<p>I took the book, better destined for <em>moi </em>than some encephalitic, terminal patient in the local infirmary. I read and reread it. Copied the text, typing word-for-word <em>The Bear</em>, <em>The Old People, Race at Morning</em>, even the dedication to Faulkner’s editor, Saxe Cummins:</p>
<p>We never always saw eye to eye<br />
but we were always<br />
looking at the same thing</p>
<p>Brilliant!</p>
<p>It was the introduction that encapsulated and held fast his native place, Mississippi, from prehistory to the present. You could see the timeless landscape, smell the humid air and fresh blood. It was all there, and I was captivated. Here was genius on the page. Nothing lost about this man, his generation notwithstanding.</p>
<p>I recalled that Serge Romanov had become emotional only once in my presence—when he and Molotov laughed and sobbed deep into the night, an empty vodka bottle between them, about the ancient village on the Russian steppes from whence these two unlikely survivors sprung.</p>
<p>That’s it!</p>
<p>I will substitute all things Russian for all things Faulkner—the Volga for the<br />
Mississippi, Cossacks for Choctaws, serfs for slaves, bear for bear, and on and on.</p>
<p>Praise the Lord.</p>
<p>I am saved—or so I hoped.</p>
<p>It was the morning before Thanksgiving, and the Meltemi, that ill wind from the north, was having one last blow. It is said the Macedonian King Philip planned his military campaigns in sync with the predictable Meltemi to keep enemy ships at bay. That was too much for me to ask, but I did sense a good omen with every breeze.</p>
<p>The sleek profile of the <em>Obscenity </em>appeared on the horizon, drew closer, and dropped anchor. Serge, Malaise, and a dozen of his Euro-trash hangers-on came ashore in the launch operated by the ever-present Molotov/Smirnoff/Popov. We had drinks at a seaside bar. I was unusually calm compared to the weather when Serge asked, “So, my friend, are you ready for your trial by words? To put Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and the entire Lost Generation in their place?”</p>
<p>“I am prepared,” I replied with Zen-like composure.</p>
<p>It was all arranged. The launch would return for me tomorrow at 5:00 p.m. We would have a sumptuous meal, the Filipino staff was to dress as Pilgrims and Indians, and then I would state my case.</p>
<p>I slept well that night. Next afternoon, girding my loins for battle, I fastened my vintage Patek Phillipe watch to my left wrist and knotted a silk Ferragamo tie in a half-Windsor snug against the collar of my Turnbull &amp; Asser shirt, sleeves held fast by Clinton-era presidential cufflinks. I slipped on white cotton Saville Row slacks, added a bespoke blazer, a Burberry of London scarlet square flowering from its breast pocket. Gucci loafers—no socks, of course. I put on my polarized Ray-Ban sunglasses, collected the leather Louis Vuitton valise that contained the key to my questionable future—ten pages of typescript—and started for the pier, some one-hundred paces from my quarters.</p>
<p>The <em>Obscenity </em>was backlit by the setting sun in a most dramatic fashion. The<br />
launch and the ever-dependable Ivan Novaya Molotovski (I had at long last learned his name) were idling just off the dock. I walked to the end, waved, and shouted to get his attention. He glanced my way, looked back at the <em>Obscenity</em>, then at his watch.</p>
<p>At that very moment the great ship’s hull seemed to inflate and lift out of the water. A bright-orange fireball engulfed the <em>Obscenity</em>, blinding all except those wearing Ray-Bans. The sound and concussion reached us an instant later. It knocked me to earth and forced the launch hard up against the pier.</p>
<p>I sat up and looked directly at Molotovski, not ten meters away. Smiling, he raised a thumb to his front teeth and flipped a timeless (if lower-class) gesture of disdain, disgust, and dismissal. Then Molotovski opened the throttle and motored off.</p>
<p>I was stunned but regained my feet and composure. The great ship and all it stood for were gone, disappeared, vanished like a bad dream. My leather valise had come open and the neatly typed pages were swirling around my feet and into the water.</p>
<p>It was Thanksgiving and, at long last, I had something to be thankful for.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If Cecilia Davenport lived in some other city, she and her husband would have bought a brownstone near a park, and then some other nanny who wasn’t Molly could walk Annabeth and Odette to it.</p>
<p>But then again, Molly thinks as she drives out to Cecilia’s, you don’t generally end up in <em>Architectural Digest </em>like Cecilia and Mr. Davenport have if you live in a place where houses and parks rub shoulders, where there are mundane things like <em>sidewalks</em>.</p>
<p>To even call the part of town where Cecilia lives a neighborhood feels wrong.  The angular limestone houses on the other side of Molly’s windshield are set back on their two-acre lots, obscured by dark blots of cedar, hemmed in by powdery cliffs in extremely picturesque but non user-friendly ways. Out here, the closest thing to a sidewalk is the faint path behind the Davenport’s house that their daughter Annabeth likes to walk in the hopes that she and Molly might spot deer.</p>
<p>Molly reaches for her coffee cup in the holder between the seats. Deer.  This early, any that jump toward the road would be a tawny blur, and if a deer and her Toyota crossed paths, it wouldn’t be Molly’s Toyota that came out on top.</p>
<p>Not like a deer would, either.  If Molly totals her car, where will she be?</p>
<p>Shit creek, no paddle.  No way to get to work.  Not even Mr. Davenport’s forest green Passat has completely recovered from hitting a deer. For weeks, Molly has skirted its crumpled hood in the garage on her way into the house every morning.</p>
<p>Usually there are landscaping trucks pulled over to the shoulder of the road that she also has to watch out for, but today she’s on her way to work so early that the morning has just started to force pink onto the sky.  She has the road to herself. She slows the car and flicks on the turn signal.  It’s so easy to overshoot the Davenports’ driveway, so easy to miss the house cantilevered into the hillside, even in full daylight.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>At first, Molly figured that the studio attached to Cecilia’s house, the clean white box awash with light that was the focal point of that spread in <em>Architectural Digest</em>, was off limits to her charges, Annabeth and Odette.  Because if she — Molly<em> — </em>had had a studio, <em>hers</em> would be.  At first, she’d also assumed she’d spend her time at Cecilia’s sitting on the blocky clichéd barge of sofa in the living room, staring through the ever-compelling portal of her phone, while Odette slept the cherubic sleep of a cherubic infant in her crib and Annabeth entertained herself quietly in some far-off room.</p>
<p>But the reality is the list of instructions Cecilia rattles off almost before Molly has time to get down the hallway hung with paintings that Cecilia did back in the 90s, back when she was Molly’s age, a brilliant young artist with henna’d hair hacked into bangs.</p>
<p>When Molly walks into the kitchen, Cecilia is sitting with her elbows on the table, silk blouse unbuttoned to the waist and hiked to one side, attached to the voracious apparatus of the breast pump.  “The studio’s a wreck,” Cecilia greets her.  “Could you start with that, please?”  She raises her voice over the pump’s wheeze.</p>
<p>Molly always finds it hard to look her employer in the eye when she’s pumping. She busies herself at the sink, feeding bits of toast into the disposal, slotting crusted plates into the rack in the dishwasher. “And then the living room,” Cecilia says to her back.  “And the downstairs bathroom.  Don’t worry about the rest. They always want to see the studio, though.”  She pauses.  “Ted’s working from home —but Annabeth, honey, Daddy’s <em>working</em>.  You can’t bother him.  Molly’s in charge. The grocery list’s on the counter.  Molly, if you could just brown the roast and get it in the oven I ought to be able to take over when I get back — <em>oh, shit</em>.”</p>
<p>Molly turns around.  Cecilia is disengaging herself from the pump’s sinister tubing.  She buttons and tucks, staring down at the phone she holds in one hand.  “It’s already seven-forty-five and his flight gets in at eight-twenty.” Her heels clatter against the Saltillo tile and Molly understands that Cecilia has drawn the short straw yet again:  she has to pick up another finalist for the art department’s tenure-track position at the airport.  “Odette’s not up yet. Just give her this when she wakes up.  If I’m not back before she starts fussing, there’re a couple more bags in the freezer. But the main thing I wanted to tell you….” She takes a breath.  “The main thing is that Annabeth hasn’t been able to find one of the cats.  Can you check the closets for Vanessa?  Or maybe she got out last night. Somehow.  Virginia’s  — where <em>is </em>Virginia, Annabeth?”</p>
<p>Annabeth crawls out from under the kitchen table, swallowing sobs.  “On my bed,” she says, coming to stand beside her mother.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand how that cat could have gotten out.  Could you and Annabeth take a look around for her?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” Molly says.  She wipes her hands on her jeans and takes the warm bottle of milk her employer hands her, with shrinking fingers.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The way to make things work, Cecilia explained back when Molly was her favorite graduate student, back before Cecilia’s long slog to tenure, back before Odette arrived on the scene, is to time things so that the babies will always be born in mid-May.  That way you’ll at least have the summer before you have to go back to teaching a full load of classes.</p>
<p>Except this time, it didn’t work out quite the way Cecilia had hoped.  Odette was born in early August, and Cecilia had to go with Plan B, which was the Nanny.  “Oh, and could you grab a couple of bottles of wine while you’re out?”  she asks, stooping to kiss Annabeth on the top of her head.  “Something that goes with pork roast.  I’m sure he’s a drinker.”  She gives Molly a look.  “Bless you.”</p>
<p><em>I don’t even like kids</em>, Molly had said as she sat down in the chair in Cecilia’s office on campus, looking across the desk at her former thesis advisor, thinking how much she looked like warmed over dog-shit.</p>
<p>Which turned out to be exactly what Cecilia felt like.  She’d gone on medication and things were looking better, but part of the reason everything had unraveled was because she kept feeling extremely anxious, about the baby.  She knew Molly was sweet with kids, besides she’d heard through the departmental grapevine that the postgrad fellowship Molly had applied for hadn’t come through and she needed a job.</p>
<p><em>I don’t even like kids, </em>Molly said again, more faintly. Annabeth adores her, Cecilia keeps saying, but Molly knows the truth:  Annabeth hardly knows her.  Love is the carrot, dangled, to keep her from quitting.</p>
<p>Love.  Certainly not a factor in any job Molly ever had before.  Not at the restaurant, not at Sam Flax, not at Kinko’s.</p>
<p>Maybe what she really is, she speculated to Martin right after she started working for the Davenports, is Cecilia’s <em>wife</em>. She and Martin were lying on his futon on the floor of his studio apartment, light beginning to seep around the edges of the curtains, and she needed to throw back the blankets and get ready for work. The previous night she’d had to stay late at Cecilia’s:  at midnight the two of them had stood companionably side by side in front of the sink, Cecilia handing her slick plates to put in the dishwasher, tipsy from the chore of hosting the Dean and the Chair of the Art Department and the latest potential hire — really, Cecilia had said, maybe what <em>everybody</em> needs is a wife.</p>
<p><em>            I don’t think I’d mind being somebody’s wife, </em>Molly said softly to Martin.</p>
<p><em>Listen to you, </em>he said, rolling away from her to eye the ceiling. <em> </em>Martin — whose parting shot would turn out to be <em>so what that you look after her kids?  You want a medal? It’s just another shit-job.</em></p>
<p><em> </em>“You and Molly’ll have such a nice day together,” Cecilia promises Annabeth, searching her purse for her car keys. “And you can stay up for Mommy’s party tonight.  Why don’t you show Molly the new books we got at the library?” She gives Molly another look, weighty with meaning.  “Please look around for Vanessa.  She can’t have gone far. Call me if you need to.”</p>
<p><em>*</em></p>
<p>The Davenport’s beautiful house is filled with beautiful art.  Art Molly loves to look on. So for a while, the stage before this stage, she supposes, she tried to convince herself <em>that</em> was reason enough to stay with the job, reason enough to be happy — the slant of light on the gleaming wooden floors and the quiet, and the milky bubble at the corner of Odette’s mouth whenever she falls asleep clutching a bottle.  Which she is not supposed to do, or Molly to allow, because it’ll be bad for the teeth Odette doesn’t actually have yet.  The fact is that there are bold still-lifes hung everywhere, even the kitchen, oil paint on canvas, such an <em>orgy </em>of art that Molly can hardly comprehend it.  She begins to run a sponge over the marble countertop.   How much longer can she rationalize what she’s doing?  She needs to go back to school, so she can get her education certificate, so she can teach art to preschoolers, at least until the next downturn, when such positions will once again be cut.  It has been months since Cecilia last asked her how her own painting was going, months since Cecilia dropped the name of one friend or another who has a gallery.   She has even stopped saying <em>Etsy</em>:<em>  </em>has Molly thought about putting her canvases up for sale on Etsy?</p>
<p>“Now,” Annabeth says.  “We need to look for Vanessa now.”</p>
<p>Mr. Davenport, also known as Ted, who, in an idiot rhyme Molly made up to make Martin laugh, likes to bake bread —sometimes he actually does bake it.  He left a rock hard heel of a loaf on the counter for her to chuck in the garbage, a fairy tale trail of crumbs for her to brush into the sink.   <em>He</em> certainly doesn’t have time to be anybody’s wife.</p>
<p>She lobs the end of the loaf into the mouth of the trash can and looks down at Annabeth consideringly.   There’s the studio to straighten, the roast, the wine that needs to be purchased.  “As soon as Odette wakes up,” she tells her charge.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>In the beginning, it was easy for Molly to think of Annabeth as a type.  Those Botticelli curls! What <em>was </em>their provenance?  They surely hadn’t been inherited from Mr. Davenport. Annabeth was a type, the sort who reeled off the names of dinosaurs and wanted to go to the grocery store in sparkly dresses.  Indulged daughter of bright parents.  What might it do to such a child, Molly wondered aloud to Martin one night, what might it do to a child to always have in front of it the evidence that it had once been its mother’s beloved?  For <em>baby </em>Annabeth had been Cecilia’s muse, in paintings that swathed their domesticity in a soft Dutch light that shouldn’t appeal.</p>
<p>But it did.  <em>No good could come of it,</em> she’d say to Martin now. <em>No good can come from any of it</em>, she thinks as she stands at the sink.  She wrings water from the sponge and places it on the porcelain soap dish.  “Now?” Annabeth persists from the doorway.</p>
<p>In her head, Molly runs through Cecilia’s instructions. There’s the living room to pick up, the studio.  The groceries.</p>
<p>The list slops over onto her weekends and time off — Cecilia’s dry-cleaning!  The Passat’s oil change. Annabeth’s birthday.  Annabeth’s birthday had meant a Saturday trip to the high-end children’s boutique. Sprout.  And that had been her and Martin’s undoing.  Because he thought the two of them were headed out to buy <em>groceries</em>.</p>
<p>The thing was (Molly <em>gets </em>this), her boyfriend’s courage quailed. When they stood in cement-floored Sprout, with its ductwork exposed overhead like a cardiac patient’s rib cage, he glanced around at the other shoppers and lost heart.  The other people in Sprout were only a few years older than he and Molly were, but they were white-teethed and beautifully-dressed and shellacked with perfection and the babies in the strollers they pushed were named Blithe and Tweed.  In all likelihood, Molly suspected, they would exit Sprout for nurseries uncluttered by bad design or shoddy workmanship.</p>
<p>Martin was only thirty, two years older than Molly; he just wasn’t ready.  <em>Being </em>a child, he said, grinning to show that he understood the absurdity of what he was saying, was one thing.  Having a child was another. It didn’t do any good to say she wasn’t in any hurry.  He <em>saw </em>her at Sprout — the way she’d been fingering that fuchsia tulle skirt that cost almost as much Cecilia paid her a week.</p>
<p>The fuchsia tulle skirt that Annabeth is now wearing, in fact.  Annabeth watches Molly closely as Molly lifts her sister from the crib, as she wipes and wraps and then, draping Odette over one shoulder, a heavy mink stole of baby<em>,</em> walks into the kitchen to warm the bottle gently.</p>
<p>“Daddy said if Vanessa doesn’t come home, it might be coyotes,” Annabeth says, standing beside her.  “But I know Vanessa’s smarter than coyotes.”</p>
<p>“I do, too,” Molly says. Ted’s refusal to mince words with Annabeth sometimes leaves her wordless.  “Run pick up all those Legos you left in your mom’s studio so I can vacuum later. After Odette’s bottle we’ll go outside and look for her. I promise.”</p>
<p>People are always promising Annabeth things, she has noticed.  “If Vanessa and a coyote met on a dark night,” she adds<em>. </em> “I’d put my money on Vanessa.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Vanessa and her sister Virginia usually sleep wherever Molly needs to clean.  They lie on the beds and lick at each other’s ears; they subside into their dozy fugue.  They spit when she tries to move them. When Cecilia was still just one of Molly’s professors, rather than her employer, Molly wouldn’t have pegged her as a pet lover — but <em>of course</em>.  Cecilia loves Vanessa and Virginia with all her heart, when she has time to.</p>
<p>Molly’s first job for the Davenports, a trial-run, had been to house-sit and feed Vanessa and Virginia.   Cecilia had been pregnant with Odette.  She and Ted and Annabeth were going to make one last trip.  Cecilia’s <em>swan-song</em> was the way she kept describing it, to Big Sur. No point going to Napa, since she was pregnant. Two times a day for a week Molly shook dry nuggets of food into Vanessa and Virginia’s chipped china bowls; she dirtied one glass, one knife, one bowl, one spoon, and slept uneasily in the guest room in pajamas she’d never wear in her own apartment or at Martin’s. The morning Cecilia was due back, she dutifully wiped away any residue of herself that might be left around the house.  The rings on the table left by her cup of coffee. An unintentional dog-ear she’d given a page of the latest issue of <em>Art in America</em>. The cats’ nails clicked on the floorboards as they padded down the hallway past the beautiful paintings and came to twine themselves around her legs in the kitchen. The house sounded differently depending on who was in it.  Now, when it’s just her and Annabeth and Odette, it takes a giant breath, holds it in.  The minute Cecilia walks through the door and drops her oversized bag on the floor, it exhales.</p>
<p>Molly can always tell when Ted works from home, even though the door of his office will be tightly closed.  She hates it — his <em>voice</em>.  On and on — and on — too low to ever make out the words but always there, even when he stands at the kitchen counter slicing bread from the loaf, swiping whole-grain mustard from the jar, a break, he calls it.  Still talking, always talking, attached to his Bluetooth.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“Vanessa!”  Annabeth bawls.</p>
<p>What is Molly to make of her employer, who named her now-elderly cats after Virginia Woolf and her sister? Who wears the charcoal one would expect, augmented with touches of the tangerine and bottle green favored by female professors with artistic sensibilities of a certain age? The first time Molly stood in the kitchen during one of Cecilia’s parties, hired to collect dirty wine glasses and then wash them, she’d felt one way about Cecilia.  Now, sometimes, she feels another.</p>
<p>“Vanessa,” she yells, startling Odette, strapped to her chest. Annabeth stoops to examine something —nothing? —  on the ground and then trots across the yard that is less yard than it is landscape:  artful spikes of century plant, feathery grasses Molly doesn’t know the names of.  “Wait, Annabeth.  I don’t think she’s down there.”</p>
<p>But Annabeth has already started down the trail that snakes from the property line to the creek, skirting cedar and steplike protrusions of limestone.  As Molly hurries to catch up, Odette’s head thumps against her breastbone.</p>
<p>When Odette sleeps in the sling, her head lolls in a way that used to bother Molly.  Babysitters and Shaken-Baby-Syndrome will always be forever wedded in her mind, because of the trial televised back when she was little, the au pair in, where?  Cambridge? Chicago? She still pictures the au pair’s indifferent moon-shaped face as she sat in the courtroom.</p>
<p>What if Molly jars Odette? What if she drops her, what if she loses her temper? What if she falls down this hill and just <em>breaks</em> her?</p>
<p>The thing is, Martin said, the thing is, Cecilia’s faith in Molly has sucked Molly in.  <em>Sucka! </em>he said, stroking her hair.  Martin thought about her, Molly now realizes, much the way Cecilia thinks of Virginia and Vanessa.  As a pet.  <em>Don’t think for a red-hot second she doesn’t use you, </em>he added.</p>
<p>At first Molly worked for Cecilia two days a week while Cecilia taught her seminar and survey course, and then that turned into five days, because maybe then Cecilia would be able to paint again.  And then Cecilia and Ted started seeing their marriage counselor on late Friday afternoons and what with traffic sometimes they couldn’t get through the door until after seven— Molly just took over cooking supper, too, and bathing the girls and tucking them into bed.</p>
<p>And then, there always were gallery openings and lectures Cecilia was supposed to attend; they might tart them up with wine and cheese, she said to Molly (tartly), but it was also her job.  When Cecilia and Ted got home, he immediately padded upstairs to their bedroom, but Cecilia sat at the bar in the kitchen, hooking the stocking feet she had divorced from their high heels when she walked in onto the rungs like a schoolgirl.  Eating Molly’s leftovers straight from the Tupperware —having weaned her of making her stand-by meal, of microwaved hotdogs.  Cecilia ravenously scraped her plate as she reported the latest departmental gossip.  Which Molly had begun to find more and more foreign, like the internecine squabbles of kings.</p>
<p>Or they talked mediums.  Cecilia had switched to acrylics when she was pregnant with Odette. Now, even though she had switched back to oils, her paintings just wouldn’t come right.</p>
<p>Molly can’t spot Annabeth; there’s the evergreen bulk of a cedar between them. There’s a faint gritty smell to the air she has come to associate with money.  Do Ted and Cecilia have any?  <em>They </em>don’t think so. “Here, kitty, kitty,” she calls without much energy.</p>
<p>Cecilia leaves a stash of bills always on the kitchen counter, tens and twenties Molly can use in emergencies, weighed down with a fossil of the sort you might find on this trail; it’s a Cretaceous-era clam-shell, heart-shaped, the size of a fist.  Cecilia has told Molly that people call fossils like that <em>deer</em> <em>hearts</em>.  Or is it <em>dear hearts? </em>Molly wonders.  Cecilia also says Molly should use the money weighed down by the fossil for take-out, for pizza or Chinese.  But not more often than once every couple of weeks.  Molly strains to see down the hill.  “Annabeth!”</p>
<p>Odette makes a mewling sound against her chest.  Odette isn’t that much bigger than a cat herself.  Sometimes at night, when Molly dreams of work, that’s what Odette <em>is</em>. Four flower-besprigged bowls are set on the Saltillo tile in the kitchen instead of two, and Molly walks through the silent house, stooping to look under beds, checking the closets.</p>
<p>It doesn’t make any <em>sense</em>, Martin said once, why people want one.   Molly had been telling him about Vanessa and Virginia, and he had meant a pet, but she had kept quiet because he almost seemed to be talking about something else. Back when she lived in the dorm, she had taken part in a similar-sounding discussion, along with her hallmates, up late at night.  <em>How can you have children when there’s global warming</em>? somebody always asked, and they’d all nod sagely.  How can you?</p>
<p>“Annabeth!” She starts down the slope, hugging her arms to her chest both to comfort Odette and to keep her from jouncing.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The creek has dried to less than a trickle, but the rocky barrier of it doesn’t stop Annabeth.  She already stands twenty or so feet downstream from Molly with her hands on her hips.</p>
<p>“Look,” Annabeth calls.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to carry your sister out there,” Molly shouts, thinking —  shit creek, no paddle.  As usual, she set out without a plan.   What if Annabeth is looking down at the body of Vanessa?</p>
<p>Molly picks her way over the rocks and stares down at the jumble of bones scattered like pick-up sticks across the surface of the tilted stone.  For a second, she can’t help thinking:  <em>Kid. </em>Annabeth’s femur and forearm would be about the same size as this.<em>  </em></p>
<p><em>            </em>Then: <em>cat.  </em></p>
<p><em>            </em>But what lies there on top of the rock is not Vanessa.  In fact, it has not been anything for a very long time.  She saw a photograph once in National Geographic. Sun melted ice; a glacier retreated.  The process revealed all that was left, a mummified sack of bone and sinew.</p>
<p>But the dirty bas-relief spread in front of them is not quite that, either.  “Is it a skeleton?”  Annabeth asks, crouching on her hands and knees to look at it more closely.</p>
<p>“Not exactly.” Molly lifts Odette from the sling to soothe her. Odette turns her head away, face red with her desire not to be jollied.  Jiggling her, Molly lowers herself to the rock. It’s <em>something. </em>“It’s a fossil of something.”</p>
<p>“We discovered it,” Annabeth says.  “<em>I </em>did. Don’t you think it should be in the museum?”</p>
<p>Indulged child of bright parents — Annabeth knows museums.  Even Molly takes her to them, pushing Odette’s stroller past dusty habitats encased behind glass on afternoons when the temperature goes up over a hundred, reading placards out loud. Coastal Plain, Trans-Pecos. Cecilia has been clear about the rules from the get-go.  When Molly is in charge, there can be no television, no computer, no cell phone.</p>
<p>Molly honestly doesn’t pacify Annabeth with her phone — much.  What is Annabeth’s hand uncovering as it brushes away grit? A skeletal wing?  A vaguely bird-like skull? Annabeth gestures for Molly’s phone, and Molly hands it over without a word.  Annabeth holds up the phone and begins to shoot pictures; above; from the side; close up with her sister’s little bootie pulled from her foot and placed carefully in the frame.  <em>For scale, </em>she says, peering at the results on the screen. The museum will want to know that.</p>
<p>Now she carries the phone up the trail as carefully as a handmaiden with a chalice. “Chickens are dinosaurs,” she says over one shoulder.</p>
<p>Even the pea gravel in the Davenport’s driveway contains curved yellow toenails of limestone. Coiled snail shells pock walkways and stud the slab-sided buildings downtown. Molly never looked twice at them.  “I’ve heard that.”</p>
<p>“But this would be a really giant chicken.”</p>
<p>“It would be,” Molly agrees as they cross the yard. “As big as you.”</p>
<p>Maybe Annabeth has found something that matters. Stranger things have happened. “Don’t drop the phone,” she adds as Annabeth yanks open the back door and runs down the hallway to her father’s office.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>By the time Molly catches up, Annabeth has already flung open the door.  Ted’s sanctuary, Cecilia calls it — is there something bitter in her voice or is she joking? — with its creamily-painted walls and spotlit floor-to-ceiling bookcases which display his spoils from his stint in the Peace Corps.  Cowrie shells, rattles, all vaguely museum-like themselves, no wonder Annabeth’s thoughts immediately ran in that direction.  Annabeth stands beside her father’s desk chair.  He sits with his phone clamped to his ear; he stares down at his other hand, which holds the phone Annabeth handed him:  Molly’s.</p>
<p>“A dinosaur,” Annabeth is chattering.  “It should go in the museum.  Shouldn’t it?  Shouldn’t it?  We need to call them. Will you call them, Daddy?”</p>
<p><em>Where?  </em>her father mouths. <em>Who?</em></p>
<p>It’s not that Molly doesn’t sympathize with the expression on his face.  A tinny voice seeps from the phone pressed to his ear; he is nodding; he is scrolling; he seems to be weighing the phones he holds in each hand.  “Daddy,” Annabeth persists.  “We need to call.  Now.” Her words run together.</p>
<p>Molly holds out her hand for the phone and puts the other on Annabeth’s shoulder to nudge her from the room.  The shrill little voice at Ted’s ear is increasingly persistent.</p>
<p>“Annabeth, honey, fossils like that are everywhere,” her father whispers, hand cupped over the receiver.  “you know that.  We don’t need to call the museum.” He shoves the phone into Molly’s hand, an almost convulsive gesture. “Molly can take care of it.” He is like a diner pushing himself back from the table — too full, too much. Molly takes Annabeth by the elbow; she’s walking deferentially backward to the door. Ted flaps one hand at her.  <em>Later. </em></p>
<p>*</p>
<p>A good nanny would  — what would a good nanny do?  A good nanny distracts when you cry, of course. <em>Snack?  Walk?  Story?  </em>A good nanny dissembles.  <em>Your mom will be home soon</em>.  A good nanny doesn’t spend the day sitting on your bedroom floor beside you, pouring over the pictures in books, because maybe that just makes it all worse, maybe reading books like this for months is what gave you the idea in the first place.  A good nanny —</p>
<p>Why would anyone want to be a good nanny? Molly wonders.  She yanks the vacuum cleaner by its hose over the bump of the threshold into Cecilia’s studio.  She has bundled Odette back into her crib for her midmorning nap.  Annabeth sprawls on the white sofa in the living room, eyes glued to — what else? — <em>Dora the Explorer.</em></p>
<p><em>            </em> One side of Cecilia’s studio is stacked floor to ceiling with quantities of the medium Cecilia bought back in the nineties for little more than a song. Cecilia’s <em>medium</em>:  all the linoleum that the last independently-run hardware store in Taylor, Texas had in stock when it went out of business. Explosive, expansive florals in coral and jade green; deco grids that scream out <em>Bauhaus</em>. Although maybe <em>medium</em> is not exactly the right word<em>.  </em> All this old linseed oil and pine rosin linoleum is just the material, the canvas, so to speak, that Cecilia paints upon.</p>
<p>Or used to paint upon. Her early work hangs on the walls, but Molly can’t detect the faintest ghostly whiff of turpentine in the studio.  She stands in the center of the studio and takes a deep breath.  To remind herself — of what?  Walking over to the paint-spattered table, she touches the tips of the sable brushes stood up in an old soup can.  Hoping against hope—</p>
<p>But the brushes aren’t damp, are never damp. She plugs in the vacuum cleaner and turns it on.</p>
<p>The first night Cecilia ever left her in charge, she and Ted had had a dinner to go to, and then a reception, and then one thing had led to another and it had gotten later and later.</p>
<p>A figure-eight of wooden traintrack covers the floor of the studio, running beside, between, brightly-colored structures, a village of Legos.  The same ones Annabeth promised she’d put up.  Molly crouches on the floor and begins to scoop up handful after handful, tipping them into the bin on the floor.</p>
<p>The first time Cecilia left her in charge, it got later and later.  Molly had sat on the sofa with Annabeth on her lap, listening for the sound of the tires of the forest green Passat crunching up the fossils in the gravel driveway.  Her texts, first to Cecilia, and then to Ted, went unanswered.</p>
<p><em>Just go without me,</em> she had finally given up and texted Martin, who was waiting for her to get home.  Eventually he had. To the party that would turn out to be the place where he’d talk to Brianna for the very first time.</p>
<p>Out at the Davenports’ that night, Annabeth had had the glassy stare that portended fever.  Her temperature kept climbing. 101 degrees, 102. 103.  It wasn’t the end of the world, Molly knew.   But she just was the nanny. She searched through the medicine cabinet in the master bathroom for children’s Tylenol another time, pushing aside the dome of Cecilia’s diaphragm left drying on its bottom shelf.</p>
<p>She yanks at the vacuum cleaner and it trundles behind her.  She is tired of stooping.  Tired of picking up things.  She moves the wand of the vacuum cleaner across the floor.</p>
<p>Up goes a little Lego wizard, up goes a little golden-haired princess. Up goes a corner of the castle they live in.  There are so many little plastic blocks — it’s easy to convince herself that Annabeth will never notice the absence of any of these minor characters at all.</p>

<li>It Being Forbidden</li>
</ol>
<p>A child came into the world missing one part, though in other respects she was perfect, and the curve of the nub where her part should have been, serene as the arc of an egg or a moon, would prove, in the end, to be functional, if clumsy. But that wasn’t why people loved her; people loved her, despite her deficiency, because she was gentle and she was kind and she was good.</p>
<p>We knew the rules of course, it being forbidden to harbor anomalies, and while some (like this child’s) were inbred, others took time to develop and were subtle, or they came on later with no warning.</p>
<p>My own father’s face, for example, did not begin to lose its form and definition until I was in grade school, and even then the progression was slow. Throughout the time it took for his features to lose their once distinctive qualities – the bridge of the nose becoming indistinguishable from the inner arc of brow, his lips blurring into his chin – we could almost ignore it, even as, just down the street, a playmate’s mother arose one morning completely unrecognizable to her children.</p>
<p>Farther south, in the larger towns and cities where everything was nice, it never would have happened the way it happened here, so it was not without some trepidation that we let the girl grow.</p>
<p>It’s a slippery slope, my father objected. Then he raged about gene pools and race.</p>
<p>After he was gone, and the mother down the street, our two families merged, siblings grinning awkwardly across the supper table at other siblings not our own, the replacement mom or dad not quite fitting into the space where the other, prior parent once had sat. It wasn’t the same, but it was all right. The rules were clear.</p>
<p>But with the girl, for some reason, we overlooked them and, in this way, cut ourselves off from the towns and larger cities to the south. What need had we of others when we had her? What need had she for her missing part when she had us?</p>
<p>Looking back, it’s safe to say I loved her best. I always chose her first when we were picking teams and took to emulating both her manner and her dress. We had regular play dates and sleepovers, spooned like spent lovers in our little bed, where we sweetly examined the clefts of our bodies, the illicit smooth cup of her nub.</p>
<p>I loved her, I tell you, but as near as I remember, one day we were fashioning breasts of soapy bubbles on our flat chests in the bath and filling in her missing part; the next, subtle shifts inside us strained our fond communions, as I had begun to notice her difference.</p>
<p>By then, of course, I was not the only one.</p>
<p>One night I dreamed of my father, hunched over and struggling to speak through a smooth white patch where his mouth should have been. You should never tell your dreams, that much I know.</p>
<p>In time we began to wonder why we’d kept her to begin with. She’d been pleasant enough as a child, milky-eyed and docile, but who would want her now? Who would take care of her if she were in need? Her clumsiness no longer seemed endearing, and we saw now it was not without pain. Sometimes, we noticed, she winced. Sometimes we did things to cause this.</p>
<p>And so time passed. We had our youthful dances, rites of passage – graduations, marriages. Our children were born whole, or not, and we kept them or not, depending. In truth, I have almost no memory of those years, which went by in a blink – my children were small – with her all alone in her mother’s small house, her mother already long gone.</p>
<p>Still, I don’t know why she did what she did. My father was against her from the start – why was she for him?</p>
<p>By the time the girl, who was no longer a girl but a crippled woman with an acrid scent, went out to save my father and the others, she had such an appearance of striding and purpose that would put anybody off. That morning she rose before dawn to clatter about in her little house, muttering curses or prayers, not a single trace of sweetness to her now.</p>
<p>When she finally emerged, she’d packed a little backpack that had fluorescent stripes and a little hose for drinking water out of. We could tell by the way she’d packed it she meant to be gone for a long while, yet not one of us moved to help or stop her. We watched her through our closed blinds, and we let her go.</p>
<p>And so this is how I know that what the others say is true, how she paused before my house to stare at my blue door, chewing on a long blade of grass. Watching her I forgot, for the first time in years, about her missing part and thought instead of how we had loved her as a child. I remembered the bitterness of my father’s denunciations that had done nothing to protect him in the end. I thought about the slim spoon of her body cupped in mine.</p>
<p>I thought all this, and thinking it, was on the verge of calling out to her, when suddenly her own mouth formed the shapes of words I could not hear, as she shifted the backpack and turned to move on.</p>
<p>Later that morning we gathered at her house to survey what remained of her work.</p>
<p>If you can call it that, one of us harrumphed.</p>
<p>And after everything we did for her, we thought.</p>
<p>But most of us stood stock-still and stared. Strewn all about her little house were notes – notes and notes and notes on scraps of paper, bits of maps and careful calculations, and one whole wall covered with drawings of mechanical parts. We stood there for the longest time among the piles of notes, all the spare parts we had among us rattling around like useless cogs, and knew that though each of the notes that littered her house began with a name, not one of ours was among them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Like a Red Rubber Ball</li>
</ol>
<p>And among us there was one boy who suffered from a nagging cough.</p>
<p>We first noticed it when he was still an infant in his crib plagued by small attacks of hacking, though his mother always said it started earlier, in the womb.</p>
<p>Some babies hiccough, she said. This one coughed. It tore me up inside; it never stopped.</p>
<p>If the boy were in the room when she said this, he’d crook his elbow over his mouth – for he always did cover his mouth – and cough, but apologetically and with, perhaps, a bit of remorse. Though we were not unsympathetic, there was little we could do, and because his coughing fits would come on without warning – in gym class, as he studied for exams, on the busses during field trips – we were forced, in our own way, to avoid him. In this we had plenty of assistance, as teachers held him back from any vigorous activity and parents were reluctant to include him in our play dates, leaving the boy to spend his childhood alone, struggling to master his cough.</p>
<p>But the cough would not be mastered. The cough rose at random from the back of his throat or deep in his chest as a sudden, inexorable force of something expelling itself out of his body and into our air. It’s not clear, even now, what it was, but it was <em>something, </em>and even if sickness was not so common back then, contagion was already greatly feared. Thus, when the cough came, it struck the rest of us with dread, as we held our breath and turned away. We held our breath; we turned away. We were not unkind, but we were wary.</p>
<p>It naturally goes without saying that all the boy ever wanted was what anyone would want – what all of wanted – some little companionship to get him through his days, and perhaps, one day, a family of his own. But because desire was the one thing that could really stir his cough up, he did not dare to hope for much and tried – really tried – to strip himself of want, though in this he achieved only modest success, at best slightly curbing his taste for sweets or fresh air or vistas of seascapes or meadows, while finding himself – he was human after all – utterly incapable of lessening his longing for love.</p>
<p>Like us he attended the mixers where people answered questionnaires in search of other people with the same answers, but his hands would go clammy just filling them out, and then, of course, he’d cough.</p>
<p>He accumulated numerous potential lovers online, but the first real-time telephone call (we still used telephones back then), complete with its coughing, was always the last.</p>
<p>He even sometimes went to movies hoping to strike up a conversation with the person in the bubble next to his, but there’d always be last minute shuffling about that would leave him surrounded by a swath of empty bubbles, and then there he would sit, right smack dab in the middle of his own desolation, with the rest of us having to see.</p>
<p>The boy was not sick. He did not have germs. My cough, he would try to convince us in ration queues and waiting rooms, will never be your cough, though in this he would prove to be wrong.</p>
<p>Over time, like most of us the boy, now a man, began to see things differently, to accept his cough almost like a lover who would never disappoint him or cause him real pain. For despite its persistence, his cough – unlike the ones we were suffering from by now, as it was getting truly tough to breath – did not burn his throat or cause his chest to ache. And while the boy, now a man, continued to be radiant and thrive (save for his cough), the rest of us were, one by one, succumbing to disease. But not him, who might still be wakened in the middle of the night by what was now his lifelong cough, but who always felt refreshed when it was gone, as if <em>something</em> – not love, but something like it – had just passed through and out of him.</p>
<p>Not that he could have used the word “us,” but we could, and who among us had not noticed the compassion in his eyes, which we began to suspect might release us from our suffering were he not so parsimonious with it.</p>
<p>Just look at him, we thought, not without some bitterness. Cough it up. Cough it out.</p>
<p>Still we could not – we <em>could</em> <em>not</em> – act on our suspicions – indeed, our <em>hopes</em> – for what if we turned out to be wrong?</p>
<p>Then, in his final days, a strange thing happened, as the cough at last subsided. There were not so many of us left, but we all heard it anyway, the quiet, and went at once to check on him, who had once been been a boy with a nagging cough, but who was now a very old man.</p>
<p>I was the first one to poke him – oh so very gently, on the chest. He didn’t move or make a sound – he didn’t even cough – but such serenity surrounded him that I found myself engulfed by a memory of grade school that included a red rubber ball and a subdued circle of pliant children, politely kicking the ball, one to the other. There’s a tree, the sun-soaked asphalt sticky with heat, and me, as ever, the clumsiest child. <em>Kick, stop; kick, stop</em>. My turn is coming, and then it is here. There is no pleasure in this, but what can I do? You kick when it’s your turn, and it’s my turn now. So I haplessly kick at the ball, but miss, just grazing the red, round curve of its top, and sending it off to no person at all. The ball, as if with a mind of its own, does just what it always does when I kick – waggles a couple of feet, then stops. Everyone is looking at me, and flushed with the shame of their looking, I step up again and kick resolutely. This time, I smack that ball dead on its center and harder than I ever thought I could, so of course it flies off on its own beyond our small, decorous circle all the way to where the boy is standing in the dim shade of the single tree, his white mask clinging damply to his face. Of course he knows not to touch it, but it’s coming right at him and what is he supposed to do? So the boy lifts his foot to stop the ball, which he does with a kind of surprising finesse, which we would all have noticed if he hadn’t just like always, started coughing. He coughs and he kicks the ball back to us in our now shattered circle, as we – we run shrieking away.</p>
<p>Now, as we each poked him in his quietness, one by one, the feeling that overcame us was not so much, as it should have been, shame, but regret. How few there were of us left to see this!</p>
<p>Well, I’m not proud of what I did, but what choice did we have? So I went to him at last to take his cough as mine, to swallow it whole like the red rubber ball of the <em>something</em> that rose from his throat as I knelt at his side and put my mouth to his, lip to lip, thinking only of how different things might be if I’d allowed myself to do this when we were young, instead, and full of promise.</p>
