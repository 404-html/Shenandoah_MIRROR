								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>McIntire—the one with the skullcap and the chewed-up knuckles—brought his rifle to his shoulder and swept it side-to-side across the gulley below. The spot he’d chosen was called the Jut, because there was a natural tongue of land rolled out between two gashes, each with its own creek in it—what used to be the God-Almighty Greenbrier River. He knew that a beast would stop short on the tip of that piece of land long enough for him to sight a high-percentage shot from the bridge above. This was not how hunting had forever been done, not even how he’d had done it as a kid, but times were changing, and hunger has always called for innovation. Still, the sport had all but gone out of it.</p>
<p>Through his scope, McIntire saw the first animal, a fragile and panicked white-tailed doe, approaching the treeline halfway across the sandbar, and behind her, surprisingly, another. They bounded over the skinny piece of land until they reached the water, where they stopped and began pacing, side-to-side, unwilling to swim, but also unwilling to return in the direction they’d come. McIntire raised a dirty finger and the man beside him, Gordon, an ex-Guardsman and former mechanic, moved into position. “Me right, you left,” McIntire whispered, and then, “Three… two…,” and the snap of their rifles rolled across the top of the water and brushed against the grass. A crow screamed and left out from his tree.</p>
<p>McIntire had known plenty, prior to the war. He’d been an accountant, a man trusted by the community’s wealthy, a volunteer firefighter. He’d hung bags on doorknobs with the Cub Scouts, one of whom was his son, Liam, and he’d come back to get them, bursting with canned food for the homeless, a week later. He’d spent his summer weekends tarring the roofs of Little League dugouts behind the elementary school and clearing brush from the picnic area at Jefferson State Forest. An invaluable member of society, by any measure. But now, as he leaned on the hood of a rusted-out Mercedes, watching the deer below him stiffen and wheeze, his rewards for a life well-lived—beautiful house, sexy car, sleek, capable wife—seemed both embarrassingly selfish and totally out of context.</p>
<p>While the does bled out and bleated weakly on the Jut, McIntire and Gordon looked to the treeline and saw several others: a bear cub, a mangled fox missing a leg, a dog that looked to have some shepherd in him. They heard hooting and whistling, a man shouting “Here, dayr! Here, dayr! Yah, y’all fuckers!” and suddenly the treeline erupted with the terrified bodies of several dozen deer, dogs, and pigs, rushing the waterline head-on. Hetch, the third man in McIntire’s crew, appeared from the woods, swinging his machete around his head like a propeller and popping rounds off with a revolver. “Goddammit,” Gordon said, shouldering his rifle and peering at the bounty. “Goddammit Jesus, Macky, it’s Christmas. Holy shit.”</p>
<p>Before a rental truck exploded, leveling most of his neighborhood, Gordon had spent his days wanting. Divorced and broke, he passed miserable mornings in front of grocery stores, shaking a cup at people. He had skills, but back then, skill meant very little; most people had taken to fixing their own cars, so Gordon spent his days panhandling and his nights burgling country homes, searching for something to eat. Three years, he did that. And then one night, after the war was won, McIntire had been out on a security sweep and found Gordon hunkered down in the dank garage where he’d been living. The man was filthy—feral, McIntire thought—and muttering to himself, and McIntire could see he was on the brink of madness. When McIntire reached into his bag and handed Gordon a long strip of dog jerky, the man snatched it and gnawed at it as though possessed. He hissed a thank you through his brown and broken teeth. They became hunting partners and friends.</p>
<p>The animals stood in a writhing clump at the tip of the Jut. McIntire held his finger in the air so Hetch, fifty yards away, could see it. “Steady, Gordy,” he said. “We don’t need this much meat. Ain’t got nowhere to keep it.” He could easily see it was the biggest trap they’d ever set, more animals at once than probably any man had seen in years. But he knew that to slaughter them all would mean spoiling most of the flesh—refrigeration was a distant memory, after all—and to leave them would mean something to hunt next week, when they were hungry again. He knew Gordon was agitated about it; sweat dripped into his friend’s eyes and he had a sway in his stance. “We could give some away,” Gordon said. “We don’t know anybody,” McIntire said.</p>
<p>McIntire knew why Gordon balked at restraint. His loss had come quickly: his ex-wife and daughter had just pulled up to his building—visitation day—when the truck bomb rocked his street. In a single moment, he’d lost his home and his family, fucked up as they may have been, so he had a unique understanding that tomorrow was no guarantee. McIntire, for his part, had tended to an infected cut on his wife’s leg—shrapnel from a pipe bomb—for three full months before she died. His son, missing his mother, had refused afterwards to eat. It had taken him nearly a year to starve himself to death. McIntire’s suffering had been drawn-out, and now that was the only way he knew to do it. Hetch whistled impatiently and Gordon leveled his rifle. “Easy, Gordy,” McIntire said. “Think of next week. The week after that.” Gordon squeezed a little pressure on his trigger. “I am,” he said, and closed his eyes, and tried to breathe.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Jesus Christ. I think the fucker’s dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was 10 am, the first morning of the three-day Puck Festival in Killorglin. The exclamation came from Con O’Flaherty, my partner in Con and Ann’s Pub. Con was a big man, in his forties, with scraggly hair. I’m petite, thirty-eight, and never married. We’d had the coldest summer on record, and the clouds were so low you could’ve touched them with a step ladder.</p>
<p>The suspected cadaver was Liam O’Connor, sixties, bachelor, sheepherder, therefore benefactor of the European Union’s teat that controlled prices and paid him a subsidy for the lamb that fed hungry Germans and French. For Killorglin Pubs, the three days of the Puck Festival were like Christmas for Dunnes clothing stores. Killorglin expected to host a hundred thousand tourists. Nary would a drinking-aged male nor female spend any of the next seventy-two hours sober. To have a man die in our establishment at the start of the festival would queer attendance to our Pub.</p>
<p>Not five minutes before Con’s outburst, O’Connor was in serious discussion with Rock-on Ronnie over beers. Rock-on was a freelancing twit. He was on the receiving end of my elbow whenever I felt the brush of his fingers on my rump as I passed with a tray of drinks. Rock-on and O’Connor had been swearing at each other over who was the better man in Irish history. O’Connor was a Michael Collins supporter, while Rock-on was in Eamon de Valera’s camp. O’Connor had a wad of euro in his breast pocket, and he dared Rock-on to a wager on the point that de Valera orchestrated Collins’s assassination. They were red faced, spitting in their hands, and shaking on how they’d settle the question. I’d walked to the far end of the bar and was wiping glasses, when I heard Con’s shout. Rock-on had disappeared, and O’Connor was slumped forward as if asleep. The euro had disappeared from his jacket.</p>
<p>Con threw up his hands. &#8220;What a day the fucker took to die.&#8221;</p>
<p>I sidled down to take a closer look. O’Connor didn’t move.</p>
<p>Con said, &#8220;Do you think he’s in a coma?&#8221;</p>
<p>I tilted my head.</p>
<p>Con said, &#8220;I have instructions in my will. The undertaker must wait three days before embalming me. That’s how Jesus pulled off his rising from the dead. The Romans thought he was a goner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Con had lost the last vestige of his Catholic faith when he learned how many straight priests left a string of illegitimate children and the pedophiles a set of sodomized boys. I wasn’t a church goer, but there was a piece of Catholic guilt so imbedded into my psyche by my mother that it couldn’t be shed.</p>
<p>I said, &#8220;You blaspheming prick. Don’t you see that full pint of the black in front of O’Connor? When have you known him to leave a Guinness untouched?&#8221;</p>
<p>Con grabbed his head. &#8220;We can’t let this get out.&#8221;</p>
<p>I took a bottle of Jameson’s single malt off the shelf and poured us both a shot. Our Pub’s ceiling was draped with every conceivable football and hurling team flag imaginable plus photos on the walls of Con grasping the various politico luminaries who’d come by. Con gulped his whiskey, and I poured him another. I sipped.</p>
<p>I said, &#8220;Well, no one will blame us if we don’t call an ambulance. He’s dead. The undertaker wouldn’t take him because there’s no death certificate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Con said, &#8220;So, what do we do with him?&#8221;</p>
<p>My eyes went heavenward.</p>
<p>Con said, &#8220;The room upstairs?&#8221;</p>
<p>My eyebrows rose.</p>
<p>Con said, &#8220;For three days?&#8221;</p>
<p>I shrugged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You’ll leave him somewhere on the road and when discovered, the town will lament that poor Liam O’Connor passed away peacefully on his way to the Puck Festival.&#8221;</p>
<p>Con said, &#8220;You’ll need to help me move him.&#8221;</p>
<p>O’Connor was never what you’d call fragrant, but something horrid had squeezed out of him after death and the smell stung my eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’m not touching him.&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>Con grunted.</p>
<p>I said, &#8220;You’re a trained rigger. Figure something out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Con worked in construction until he tore his back. Before we opened the Pub, I’d worked with my mother running a B&amp;B in town. When she passed, I sold the place and threw in with Con. We hadn’t a romantic relationship, but we fought like a couple in a bad marriage. Since Ireland permitted divorce in 1996, Con had made the round trip to the altar twice. He was presently unattached. I let Con think he was boss. It’s a male Irish thing. I dealt with the suppliers and handled all money matters. Con’s expertise was the great Irish pastime of talking. He’d spin yarns to our clientele about his travels for European construction projects. When he’d get to the part about the twin sisters in Gdansk, I’d walk away.</p>
<p>Con hooked up a pulley and rope and raised O’Connor, still seated on his stool, to the upper level and locked him inside the storage room. Meanwhile, I ruminated over Rock-on taking O’Connor’s money seconds after death. That wasn’t right.</p>
<p>The Puck’s three days of revelry were mostly a booze-soaked blur. Money, beer, and Irish whiskey poured over our bar like the Powerscourt Waterfall. Con and I drank a fair share of the profits. To my surprise, Rock-on showed up the last evening like nothing had happened. When he fondled my rear, I allowed his hand to linger. His face told me that he welcomed a party.</p>
<p>I put my lips close to his ear, and over the noise I suggested that we meet upstairs after three-am closing. Rock-on leered. I put Chantilly cream on his fantasy by telling him, &#8220;I want you naked when I arrive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rock-on licked his lips, and his Adam’s apple bobbed.</p>
<p>For the remainder of the evening, every time I caught Rock-on’s eye, I winked. He’d look at his watch. Just before closing, Rock-on slipped up the stairs. When the last customer left, Con cleaned the bar, and I undid my apron. Con gave me a quizzical look as I mounted the stairs.</p>
<p>At the door, I knocked. &#8220;Rock-on, it’s Ann.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rock-on’s voice had a slight tremor. &#8220;Dead O’Connor’s in here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still through the door, I said, &#8220;Then, he won’t bother us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel funny.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you naked?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. But I’m uncomfortable.&#8221;</p>
<p>I opened the door. Rock-on’s nude body was a milk-white contrast to his deeply tanned face, arms, and hands. His clothes were in a pile near the door. It was obvious that O’Connor’s presence had cooled Rock-on’s ardor.</p>
<p>My eyes widened. &#8220;I thought you’d be happy to see me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rock-on gulped.</p>
<p>I said, &#8220;What do you call that wee thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>Instinctively, he covered his flaccid self. He was plaintive. &#8220;You’re too far away.&#8221;</p>
<p>I chuckled, scooped up Rock-on’s clothes, and left, locking the door.</p>
<p>Rock-on banged after me. &#8220;You’re not leaving me in here alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You’re not alone. There’s a window and O’Connor has clothes for you,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>Rock-on kept up with his banging and pleading. Con and I laughed and cleaned up for the next hour.</p>
<p>I guess the sight of Rock-on mixed with booze and had an effect on me. I moved close to Con. His eyes widened at first, then his hands enveloped me. We weren’t going to do it with Rock-on’s shouting, so we went outside and found a bed of soft grass in a cool field.</p>
<p>By the next morning, Rock-on had broken the upstairs window and climbed down naked from his perch. He left Killorglin probably in fear his nickname would be changed to Wee Rock-on.</p>
<p>Liam O’Connor’s body was found on the road between his farm and town. The undertaker wondered why O’Connor hadn’t been discovered for three days and was mystified that the corpse had stiffened in a seated position. He made an unsuccessful attempt to straighten O’Connor for the wake. I gave what remained of O’Conner’s money in Rock-on’s pants to charity.</p>
<p>The day after Con and I made love, I awoke with the headache from Hades and the never-again regrets over how much I’d drank. When I saw Con, he acted like we’d shaken hands the night before. I wanted to kick him in his O’Flaherty jewels. We’re still partners in the Pub. Things have gone just the same as before, as I said, like a bad marriage.</p>
