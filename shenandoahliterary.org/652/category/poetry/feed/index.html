								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<pre>	to see you there in the sun, shining 
with your best smile, not in fact
		gone forever, waving
off my question, delighted
	with my delight, sitting
bony on my lap, which you would never
		have done in life, my
proper friend, my neglected familiar. 

So this is how it’s going to be, this
	angry gratitude, this 
		torment of the taken-
for-granted? Speak me a sonnet
	about Darwin and daguerreotypes  
and this time I’ll try not to wake 
		to the raw dazzle of morning.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<pre>      <strong>I.</strong>

<strong>Gabriel Prosser, Hanged in Richmond for Inciting Slave Rebellion, 1800</strong>

<blockquote>Turning  our Tortures into horrid Arms
Against our Torturer….
Paradise Lost --Book II</blockquote>

The smithy, arms akimbo at his forge. The sweat
Beads glisten; long scars zigzag his ebon skull.

The flame erupts, the umber brick itself a-glow.
He hammers & shapes, 
                                              hammers & shapes the white-hot

Iron to a luminous inverted <em>U</em>. But alone now, from the corner
Beyond his tools, he unwraps his hoarded treatises,

Swadled in cloth. <em>Paradise Lost</em>. <em>Common Sense</em>: “the strength and power
Of despotism consists 
                                              wholly in the fear of resistance.”

He turns the pages in the conflagrating light. The time
Is neigh: 
                   let us turn the ploughshares into swords,

Cudgels, pikes, knives to hold upon the perfumed
Throat of Governor Monroe. But the plot will be revealed,

Captured, he is brought in chains to the Richmond gallows.
The neck snaps instantly, the “dignified demise,”

Reserved for reprobate elite. Not so lucky are his fellows. 
<em>The cart & tree gallows mode</em>:
                                                       half an hour you gasp within the noose.                   


               <strong>II.</strong>

<strong>Daniel Frank, Hanged in Henricus for Stealing a Calf: 1623</strong>
                <blockquote>…but his face
Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care
Sat on his faded cheek…
--Book I</blockquote>

Sunday morning—the Godwins are in church
& he creeps to the pen on hands & knees.

For an endless hour he’s lain in the razoring stealth
Of a briar patch, 
                                  awaiting their cart to creak

Toward steeple & hellfire. He rises to a crouch
& the noose is slipped & tightened about the neck

Of a cream & brindle calf-ling, more rope cinched
Three times around her legs.
                                                      Hard to lift,

& of course she struggles all the way to his wagon.
Five long years he’s tilled tobacco fields,

Serving out his Indenture to Miles Perrin.
But he’s free now—
                                         to let his first child

Perish of pox, his wife of childbed fever. When the sheriff
Comes upon the calf-ling, tied to an oak to graze & bray

In a forest clearing, is it not Providence, Almighty justice
That bids him hooded 
                                         & strung from the self-same tree?


            <strong>III.</strong>

<strong>A Handbag Fashioned from the Skin of Nat Turner, 1830</strong>

<blockquote>Then when I am they captive talk of chains.
--Book IV</blockquote>

They gentle the body down from noose to cart,
So it might be pristine for dissection. But first

A privileged few have been allowed to rummage it
For trophies. 
                                   The nails, a tooth, the scalp.

The top-hatted figures bob up & down inside the cart
Like pistons, supplicants whirligig-ing prayer wheels

& this one slices a foot-square piece, the delicate 
& fine-haired dermis of the lower back. It pulls

Off daintily, like cutting the pages of a novel by Scott.
Cover it in salt for 30 days, & in a broth

Of seawater & urine, stir it daily & soak it
30 days longer. 
                                   To remove the fine hairs, apply the <em>milk
  
of lime</em>. Now,  razor the remaining hairs. The bating 
will soften it, the pickling in salt & sulfuric acid

soften it further. A coin purse, workmanship flawless, befitting
a lady of refinement. 
                                    It laves & caresses the palm of her hand. 

                <strong>IV.</strong>

<strong>Various Nooses Said to Hang John Brown, Charles Town, December, 1859</strong>

<blockquote>For never can true recouncilement grow
Where wounds of deadly hate have pierce’d so deep….
--Book IV</blockquote>

One in Massachusetts, gift of Roscoe Taylor.
One in the West Virginia Historical Museum,

Also one in Lynchburg, another in Fort Royal.
In NYC, where the coffin 
                                             came for burial, a mortician claimed

the noose still coiled his neck, waxing poetic:
<em>The next best thing to the ladder Jacob saw.

He is not Old Brown, opined Thoreau. He is an Angel of Light,</em>
Though to other abolitionists 
                                                   he was crazed: blackguard, outlaw.

& what the Charleston & Richmond papers said of him is
Easy to imagine. Yet even Stonewall Jackson,

Reporting the body drop, lauded <em>his unflinching firmness</em>.
To the gallows he rode 
                                                    atop his own rude coffin.

Verbose as always, he meant his final screeds
To be good PR. <em>The crimes of this guilty land will never

Be purged away but with blood</em>.  Off to the Blue Ridge he pointed.
<em>Beautiful country!
                                         I never had the pleasure of seeing it before.</em>
  
                                 

               <strong>V.</strong>

<strong>The Lynching of James Jordan, Waverly, Sussex County, 1925</strong>

<blockquote>And on methought, alone I pass’d through ways
That brought me on a sudden to the Tree…
--Book V</blockquote>

Let us note that to lynch is not to hang.
The hanging, as Schuler reminds us, comes nearly last

& the process is protracted grievous rite.
A white woman 
                                         “attacked” in her home, her pistol stolen,

Jordan alleged to sell it to “another negro.”
Jordan is thus identified, confesses, jailed.

The mob then storms the jail. The crowd grows,
The sheriff shackled in his own cuffs.
                                                                  Jail door battered,
  
The prisoner dragged into the street, pleading mercy.
No one masked. Shotguns fired into the air

As they string him from a telegraph pole by the Chessy 
& Ohio station. As he strangles, more shots fired—

The body riddled now & doused with kerosene.
A thrown flare alights it.
                                                            The Norfolk/Greensboro

Express rockets by, for this is not a town
That warrants a stop.
                                              But the engineer slows for a better view.

<strong>VI.</strong>

<strong>How To Tie a Hangman’s Knot, 510,952 Views: (Juvenile, Name Withheld, 7 May 2012)</strong>

<blockquote>Consult how we must henceforth most offend
Our Enemy, our own loss how repair.
--Book I</blockquote>

Adderal-fueled. Kid Rock on his speakers. 2 a.m. Pale fingers click
The keyboard. Parents long asleep, the rope heaped on his desk.

He follows the voiceover entranced. The most iconic
<em>Of knots….Easy to make…  
                                                           absorbs movement & shock

Notably well. You will need a single length of rope. Create
A long u-shaped bend or “bight,” tipped

On its left side. Use adequate rope, for this knot
Requires a minimum of 7 turns, 
                                                                     with 13 preferred.

Create another bight at the end of the first, in its
Opposite direction. The rope should look like an “S.”

Put the end of the rope over all 3 legs. (A “turn” is the name for this.)
Continue the wrapping 
                                                             at least 6 times more. Stop

To tighten each one as you make it. The top of the second bight 
should poke out noticeably above the topmost turn,

Forming a loop. Pass the end of the loop from front to back. 
Pull the right hand edge of the loop & tighten. 
                                                                       Tighten again.</em>
 
              <strong>VII.</strong>

<strong>Three Monkeys on Main: Watching the Walter Scott Shooting, 2015</strong>

<blockquote> …dire was the noise 
Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss
Of fiery Darts in flaming volies flew.
--Book VI </blockquote>


Above the zinc bar’s taps & fifths, the 50-inch
Flat screens,
              floating dark as the panels of Rothko’s Chapel—

Then all come alive with CNN, iPhone footage
Grainy, sound track hiss & murmur, 
                                                                  the barrel

Flashes vague starbursts. Nine sharp reports
& the pixels of a running black man, named for a bard,

Lie now in pixels of blood, the pixels of the cop
Bending to place 
                                                something bright on the ground

Beside the body, already too bled-out to cuff,
The barman & the drinkers transfixed. 
                                                               Then the clip
 
Played again, again: pixels fleeing, pixels tumbling to asphalt
& the object 
                                         set like grave goods at the bloodied hip—

Pixeled but Paleolithic. He’s the Tollund Man, noose
Jerked tight as the bog 
                                                   awaits his millennial sleep.

Now a voice from the bar—<em>bastard got what he deserves</em>.
& then our craven silence: 
                                                   happy hour, the drinks are cheap.

             <strong>VIII.</strong>

<strong>Noose Placed in a Tree at Varina High School: (Juvenile, Name Withheld, 9 May, 
2012)</strong>

<blockquote> …save what is in destroying, other joy
To me is lost….
 --Book IX </blockquote>

By the parking lot, by the sign announcing
“Our Town,” <em>don’t text & drive!</em>, 
                                                                        SPRING FLING,

From the oak ringed with mulch & pansies,
From a limb so sturdy it could dangle a body, 
                                                                            it swings.

Pendulum-ing, a-gleam in April breeze, brightened
By the flash of a dozen cell phone cams.  
                                                                         <em>Hovering

And blazing with delusive light, writes Milton,
So glistered the dire snake.</em> O serpentine one,

Ever-loquacious in your slither up & down the Knowledge Tree.
Not so different from this kid stoked on weed, 
                                                                in a Nine Inch Nails tee,

Slinking up at midnight with his grim semiotic, his livery.
Almost losing his grip, 
                                                 he checks his fall, then knots it snugly.

& now the twine uncoils & hisses down.
Later, the county will ferret him out.

Later, there is “appropriate disciplinary action”
& workers in a cherry picker 
                                                    cut it down writhing to the dirt.</pre>

		<title>Look, Slavs</title>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<pre>Remember when you were a little kid and somebody said 
“Slav” and you thought they said “slob” and wondered
	if the two words were the same and then realized they weren’t
but thought they might be connected in some way and that 
	maybe Slavs are messy and throw their underpants on the floor 

	and leave their dishes in the sink or are said to do those things
by their sworn enemies, the Whomevers, the people who live
	across the river, on the other side of the valley, in the heart 
of the dark wood. What are Slavs, anyway? Answer: 
	an Indo-European ethno-linguistic group, even though members 

	of that group are diverse both genetically and culturally and relations 
between them vary, ranging from a sense of connection to mutual
	feelings of hostility. Slavs have even waged war on other Slavs. 
Why, though? Listen up, you Slavs: your ancestors spoke 
	the same languages you do and shared cultural traits and historical 

	backgrounds—why can’t you get along? I know, it’s because 
of what Freud called the narcissism of small differences, 
	or “the need to distinguish oneself by minute shadings and to insist, 
with outsized militancy, on the importance of those shadings.”
	But Marie Curie was a Slav, and so were Tolstoy and Tchaikovsky.

	Why not bond in pride over these illustrious predecessors?
Even better, in the sixteenth century, the bodyguard of the Doge 
	of Venice consisted largely of Slavs, which makes sense: 
if your bodyguards were Venetians, some of them 
	might belong to families that hold a grudge against yours, 

	and you know what that would lead to: gossip, rumor, betrayal, 
stabbings, people trying to trip you as you cross the Rialto, 
	somebody else saying, “Look out the window!” 
and dumping a white powder into your wine glass, 
	and when you turn around and say, “I didn’t see anything—

	say, what’s this white powder in my wine glass?” they’d  say, “Oh, 
that? I don’t know. It’s white powder. Drink it! It’s good for you.” 
	But a Slav wouldn’t do that. They’d be on the payroll. 
They like it that you’re the Doge, and they want you
	to be the Doge for as long as you can. I wish I were a Slav.
	
	No, wait—I don’t. I want to be the Doge, with Slavs 
on every side. Slavs to protect me, to get me from one place
	to the next, to keep me focused on the business of the Republic, 
to put others above myself and insure that Venice is a safe 
	and happy place brimming with culture and enterprise, with 

	green industries and vigorous bilateral trade agreements
but also musicians in every piazza and only the finest plays in our many 
	Venetian theatres. I love my bodyguards. Every time I look 
into their honest Slav faces, I think, “I’m the Doge.” Only Slavs 
	can save us. Only people who aren’t us can tell us who we are.</pre>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<pre>It’s not your fault that you didn’t like it. It’s the poems’ fault. 
And the poet’s. The poems were bad, and he shouldn’t 
	have read them. Here’s why: every time you give a talk 
		or teach a class or play a guitar in public or stage a play, 
there are always going to be several different kinds of people

	in your audience, and if it’s a poetry reading, there will be 
young people who have never heard poetry read aloud 
	and are there only because their teacher has made attendance 
		a course requirement, which makes this your 
chance to pull them like fish out of the gray lake they’ve been 

	swimming in and release them into a sunlit sea. There’ll be 
people who’ve been to hundreds of readings, their eyes in
	a fine frenzy rolling from stage to audience, audience 
		to stage, but also someone who may hear poetry for 
the last time tonight, an older person or a young fit one who 

	is about to have an aneurysm explode like a bomb in her brain
or,  most likely of all, someone much like you or me driving home 
	when the reading’s over and coming to a two-way stop, 
		only the other driver doesn’t. Or there’s someone who’s 
troubled, who feels as though life isn’t worth living, a man 

	whose woman has left him or a woman whose child has died: 
it seemed okay when it was born, and then it died, and its mother 
	joined the countless women to whom the same thing
		has happened, who knew what had happened yet
couldn’t keep from telling themselves that it hadn’t, 

	the way Mary Shelley did when she gave birth to a baby girl, 
and after the child dies, Mary writes in her journal, "Dream 
	that my little baby came to life again—that it had only 
		been cold & that we rubbed it before the fire & it lived."
Say there’s a woman in your audience tonight who

	has had that same experience. Are you going to read her
a poem about a shadow that chases another shadow
	through an interior monologue, though no one knows
		whether the second shadow is the same as the first 
or another shadow altogether, and it all takes place 

	under ice? No, you’re not, no more than you’d read a poem 
that says man that is born of woman is of few days,
	that there’s no such thing as death, that the babies are 
		all in heaven, that their mommies will see them again 
some day. Instead, you’re going to read something that is, 

	I don’t know, earthy, almost primitive, a poem 
that comforts precisely because it’s not trying to, one that focuses on
	the moment yet glances at everything that surrounds it, 
		perhaps a funny poem with a dark heart or a sad one that 
provokes belly-shaking laughter or a poem that tells a wonderful story 

	even though it contains chewy little nuggets that are indifferent, 
even hostile to story. You’re going to write an elemental poem, 
	one that has three dimensions: you can try for more, 
		as some people do, but you’ll probably end up with none. 
And after you’ve written that poem, you’re going to try it 

	out on somebody, and they’re going to like it, because 
you have written the poem that has the power to comfort 
	that grieving mother, console the lonely, give the hopeless
		hope. And you can read that poem tonight. Or you can 
read a bad poem, or more than one. What will you do?</pre>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gettysburg</p>
<p>The peacock’s spurs are caught again<br />
in the diamond chickenwire of his low<br />
slanted pen. Nobody bothers anymore<br />
to hammer the sagging barn.</p>
<p>Summer visitors regard the old farm from cars<br />
without chrome, up on the hastily paved path—<br />
if they look at all. There’s so much<br />
else to see, burnished things, and battlefields</p>
<p>all look the same. But it’s here, this land,<br />
where the war’s easy sepia finds an end<br />
and a form: like us, the shallow rust-red soil<br />
blows off for York, for Philadelphia, the coast,</p>
<p>and pasture erodes to bone. A black walnut’s roots<br />
pierce the buried limbs of our grandfathers’ fallen<br />
spruce grove. The caterpillar inches along, lost<br />
in its sad accordion hymn.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8211;for Sharon</p>
<pre><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think I now know</span>
     Why the birch will split the thin
     Layer of its skin again
And again but rarely show

The darker wood at its core.
     Although the bark peels
     Back, it won’t reveal
Anything more

Than another papery scroll
     Of white.  Maybe the wind
     Believes the tree has sinned
Against it by failing to hold

The song of its travels.  The streaks
     On this bark—brown and sparse—
     Are like a sort of Morse
That can’t transcribe the peaks

Of snow and races of rivers
     The gusts have swept across.
     But still the birch is the voice
The wind speaks in when it shivers

The flaps of bark like torn
     Sheet music.  No matter
     How it claws at the tatters,
The wind can’t change the score.
</pre>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, then, consider the proud goldenrod.<br />
It lords the pasture and roadways while all</p>
<p>summer long it busies itself with hoarding<br />
the heat and the sunlight. It holds them up</p>
<p>as an offering, all the gathered summer gold<br />
as if to say, “This! Just this! Just this and no more!”</p>
<p>And the hot sky responds<br />
“This! Just this and no more!”</p>
<p>But this happens, and then that comes to pass<br />
as you guessed it would: Summer wanes. Then</p>
<p>the goldenrod holds up its summer’s store of greed<br />
like a measured sacrifice, “This! Just this and no more.”</p>
<p>The regardless sky responds, “Just this and no more.”<br />
Now along the roadway and over all the wide pasture</p>
<p>goldenrod offers up these soft gray curls,<br />
its question, a plea, “This? Just this?</p>
<p>Just this and no more?” And the cold sky answers<br />
as you know it will.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The concerto in D streams out the moon roof.<br />
Inside the car the air is ripe with Mozart,<br />
watermelon rind, cat litter, stale beer bottles,<br />
napkins infused with fish oil, pickle juice,<br />
loneliness, and a mouse nest I shook free<br />
from the flannel sheet folded away and meant<br />
to be saved as a drop cloth. It’s andante time<br />
at the dump. High noon. On the lookout for Ralph,<br />
who likes to ask about my absent husband<br />
with his hand reaching for the small of my back,<br />
I fling paper, glass, and tin into the maw of one bin<br />
and the unsorted detritus of daily life in the other.<br />
On the take-me table there’s a wine glass,<br />
clay pots from Mexico, commonplace plastic<br />
toys, and a toaster. I’ve brought it a book<br />
with a broken spine and a box of old LP’s.<br />
Back at the car, Mozart quickens and spills<br />
his genius onto the talk at the nearest tailgate,<br />
two men in sweats, leaning back, at ease<br />
with their belly fat and old boots. Mozart<br />
raises the tempo and gives one ball cap a flip,<br />
but the men don’t notice, their talk is<br />
more contemplative than you’d think.<br />
One man tells about a friend’s recent by-pass<br />
and renewed heart—the word’s his. He says<br />
the surgeon split him up the middle like a hog.<br />
“It makes you think,” the older one says,<br />
and he pulls out of his hatch-back a large print,<br />
nicked and torn on its cardboard backing—<br />
it’s Renoir’s luncheon party on the river.<br />
Brightly colored parasols and tables,<br />
the wine uncorked, the women and men florid.<br />
Renoir—it must be noon in all his paints,<br />
the impression of light so this-worldly<br />
it’s another world entirely, and ours. Or is it?<br />
At the river restaurant just yesterday, the sun<br />
blew in green gusts, dappling the white linens<br />
on the tables, the sun afloat in the glasses<br />
of bourgeois Chablis. Across the river<br />
in the little park by a beer joint, two men<br />
with loud voices: “You’re a tough guy, huh?”<br />
one yelled and slapped the other man’s face,<br />
then made to punch his ear. Then did.<br />
Both men had ponytails and a misplaced sense<br />
of the Sixties and its abandoned protests,<br />
having run through too many motorcycles<br />
and one night stands, no place to sleep,<br />
too much straight no chaser, who knows?<br />
They socked each other in the gazebo,<br />
drew blood, yelling fuck one too many times<br />
for the wait-staff and the river customers<br />
who couldn’t intervene, but wanted to.<br />
A few looked annoyed. Someone called the cops.<br />
There were sirens, handcuffs, and in the quiet<br />
after the last crunch of gravel under the tires,<br />
a sense of smutty resolution. “Show’s over,”<br />
a waiter announced to the swordfish specials,<br />
the tacos, lush salads, and lobster rolls.<br />
At the dump now, where no one’s wasted,<br />
I hear the man on his way to recycle Renoir<br />
say, “I feel for the guy.” And because<br />
he’s turned his back and cleared his throat<br />
to hide his feelings, I believe him.<br />
“It could happen to any one of us,”<br />
he mumbles beneath the soaring cadenzas<br />
and inversions, now spritely, now sonorous—<br />
Mozart, whose body was wrapped in a torn shroud<br />
and dumped into a pauper’s grave before sun-up.</p>

<p>between the marsh grass and the dunes,<br />
so I pulled it, though naturally<br />
even out here you tend to wonder<br />
about explosions these days.</p>
<p>Out on the marsh as I tugged<br />
a black-and-white<br />
skull-and-crossbones stood up&#8211;a kite<br />
with red and black streamers.</p>
<p>It climbed a little into the air so I saw<br />
I could fly it if I got it high enough<br />
to catch the breeze. And higher.</p>
<p>I had to get it right this time. Running<br />
across Ferry Street sixty-five years ago<br />
my first kite  tore open like gift wrap before<br />
I even got it to the gate of Glendale Park.</p>
<p>This is the way things will go for you,<br />
a thought told me then, but here<br />
at the other end of my string, the dog<br />
dancing around for me to explain myself,</p>
<p>barking for me to tell him what it was,<br />
the skull-and-crossbones dancing<br />
up there too&#8211;if this is my banner, so be it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
