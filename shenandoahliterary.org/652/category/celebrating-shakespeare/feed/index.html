<p>I glimpsed her through the exact frame of ferns that you imagine—<br />
algae’ed sludge-water sucked at my ankles when I leaned forward.<br />
Bog-stink makes people like you wince, no matter how shallowly<br />
you try to inhale, but biodegradation’s smell never once infringed<br />
on our scene. Our prelapsarian world was always black &amp; white,<br />
but she stood there in the chlorophyll’tered light, &amp; when she turned<br />
to see me her face lit me up like a switched-on klieg in a dingy warehouse<br />
just before a sceneboy snaps his chalked-up clapboard. In California,<br />
I’ve long since learned, the man with the whitest teeth will be the lead,<br />
&amp; each frame of film is its own blazon for his strong jaw, his dimple’s depth,<br />
or for the curve of his leading lady’s thigh under impractical silk,<br />
her hand to her open mouth, hair falling loose as she swoons<br />
before the single vaseline-smeared lens. My own shoulders have a heft<br />
that strains a linen shirt, &amp; where I’m from, every audition opens &amp; closes<br />
with a single display of claws. I’m the biggest predator there is.<br />
That white-coat cheats out to the audience every time he talks to her—<br />
he’ll never tear a hole in a car for her, never soften her pallet with Spanish moss<br />
or cattail rushes, never bring her a baby alligator or wrestle invasive snakes<br />
tired of cooling themselves on branches above her bed. But even I, web-handed,<br />
scale-scalped—even I can take a note: she screamed as my calloused hand<br />
reached to steady her, &amp; when she flinched at my fen’s softest fronds . . . ah.<br />
I have my complimentary ticket in hand. I’ll cash it in, sit in the velvet dark.<br />
Listen to frames click past. Let her celluloid negative cast me in shadow, instead.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The play opens, famously, with a storm. We are in the midst of it, and we know only that a boat is shattering on a violent sea and men are shouting. Tempest-tossed, lost and frightened, these characters seem far from any familiar land. In later scenes we will learn that only some of them apparently survive, to find themselves in a strange place amid weird flora and fauna, puzzling natives&#8211;an atmosphere of magical possibility and lurking danger. What did Shakespeare’s early seventeenth-century audience make of these exotic, otherworldly first scenes of <em>The Tempest</em>? They might well have sensed evocations of that distant, unreal America so recently “discovered,” conquered, settled by seafaring British and European voyagers. One of Shakespeare’s probable sources for the play was an account of the shipwreck off Bermuda of a vessel bound for the ill-fated Jamestown settlement in Virginia, that colony named for Queen Elizabeth. Despite the tragic back-stories, the play&#8217;s audience perhaps felt intimations of new ways of life emerging from upheaval. They might even have discerned stirrings of a new democratic, “multicultural” future, where the other is acknowledged in the self, the alien transformed into the kindred. And in time Shakespeare’s plays would become increasingly central to the new democracy of America, as it developed from a collection of theocratic and mercantile colonies into a culturally maturing nation.</p>
<p>Renaissance hopes for a revived Golden Age had long since begun to focus on those lands and peoples encountered through overseas exploration. In <em>The Tempest</em>, this urge to imagine a perfected life in a renewed world first emerges in Gonzalo’s celebrated speech in Act II, Scene 1, describing the commonwealth he would establish had he dominion over this land they have shipwrecked on:</p>
<p>In the commonwealth I would by contraries<br />
Execute all things; for no kind of traffic<br />
Would I admit; no name of magistrate;<br />
Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,<br />
And use of service, none; contract, succession,<br />
Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;<br />
No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;<br />
No occupation; all men idle, all;<br />
And women too, but innocent and pure;<br />
No sovereignty.</p>
<p>To which Sebastian replies, in one of the play&#8217;s many challenges to the idea of renewal and perfection, &#8220;Yet he would be king on&#8217;t.&#8221; This doesn&#8217;t stop Gonzalo, who asserts that nature will provide all that his &#8220;innocent people&#8221; need, and that he &#8220;would with such perfection govern, sir, T&#8217;excel the Golden Age.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scholars point to another source for Shakespeare’s play, a more literary source: Montaigne’s description in his <em>Essays</em> (Book One, Chapter 31) of a native society in Brazil recently encountered by explorers. Montaigne first links these voyages of exploration to history and mythology, going back as far as Plato’s inundated Atlantis, thereby joining (as it were) America to these earlier “new worlds” and to the perpetual vision of a once and future place of human perfection. Montaigne describes “nations” that are “barbarous in the sense that they have received very little molding from the human intelligence, and are still very close to their original simplicity.”</p>
<p>The essay is titled “On Cannibals,” and Montaigne goes on to contrast the supposed barbarism of these nations to the barbarities of his own civilization, all the while asserting the essential innocence of the aboriginals. Shakespeare too portrays a “savage,” in the person of Caliban (suggesting &#8220;cannibal&#8221;), who resides in the island on which Gonzalo imagines establishing his ideal commonwealth. And Caliban is, of course, a slave to the island&#8217;s actual sovereign, Prospero. Caliban&#8217;s brutish behavior and ignorant servility toward the newcomers who encounter him would seem to belie Gonzago’s (and Montaigne’s) notions of utopian innocence. Prophetically, perhaps, Shakespeare imagines a reborn world based on reports of American discoveries while also hinting at the enslavement and rebelliousness of the people already living in that distant place.<br />
But of course the characters in the play are not in America; they have not travelled even as far as the mythic Atlantis, just beyond Gibraltar. Shakespeare and his audience are projecting a world, inventing a sort of America, on an island off the main European continent but very close to it. An island, in fact, like Great Britain. So the nowhere land of Prospero is also a re-imagined England, like the idyllic one in Shakespearean Henry’s speech at Agincourt or the green and pleasant land evoked in Blake’s much later “Jerusalem.” These hints of America in Shakespeare might also be glimpses of a renewed England, of a new world brought into the old one.</p>
<p>Flash forward to the actual new world and the actual people in it. If Shakespeare transferred America, as it were, into England, Shakespeare’s works epitomized English culture for America&#8211;with all that implies about ambivalence, the interrelations of colonizers and colonized, and perhaps the mutable geography of the rootless, migratory modern world. Early America, of course, was dominated by religious and political concerns that, especially in Puritan New England, relegated theater&#8211;like all the arts&#8211;to a secondary status at best. But as Americans began to define themselves against England, while also continuing to identify with it, Shakespeare&#8217;s work became more and more popular&#8211;and also became a medium of cultural exchange. &#8220;Old&#8221; and &#8220;new&#8221; worlds continued to influence one another. A lesser-known example: in 1824, American scribe Charles Sprague, known as the &#8220;banker-poet,&#8221; composed verse honoring Shakespeare in which he expresses the need both to forge a new American identity and to retain a link to Britain. He addresses Shakespeare:</p>
<p>Our Roman-hearted Fathers broke<br />
Thy parent empire&#8217;s galling yoke,<br />
But thou, harmonious Monarch of the mind,<br />
Around their Sons a gentler chain shall bind:&#8211;<br />
Once more, in Thee, shall Albion&#8217;s sceptre wave,<br />
And what her mighty Lion lost, her mightier Swan shall save!</p>
<p>Sprague hopes for a new sort of English dominion, a benign cultural hegemony with Shakespeare as its central figure and ruling spirit.</p>
<p>Throughout the nineteenth century, even as immigration from non-Anglo-Saxon countries was transforming the United States, Shakespeare continued to figure prominently in the transatlantic process of mutual Anglo-American influence. This process took on at times an almost surreal quality: in 1848, the Native American Maungwudaus, a Methodist minister among other professions, travelled to Stratford-upon-Avon during a European sojourn. He paid tribute to Shakespeare and wrote about it in a poem:</p>
<p>Indians of North America<br />
Heard the name that shall not decay<br />
They came and saw where he was born<br />
How great is the sound of his horn</p>
<p>They respect and honor his grave<br />
As they do the grave of their brave;<br />
Rest thou great man under these stones,<br />
For there is yet life in thy bones.</p>
<p>Thy spirit is with Mun-nid-do,<br />
Who gave thee all thou didst do:<br />
When we are at our native home<br />
We shall say, &#8220;We have seen his tomb.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a distinctive example of Shakespeare&#8217;s pervasive presence in America. Maungwudaus&#8217; visit might also seem faintly akin to those appalling occasions when aboriginal or colonial people would be publicly displayed in Europe, sometimes dead and stuffed like animals, as specimens from exotic overseas lands. But this Native American was not being exhibited; he was an autonomous if hybrid person, internalizing Anglo culture while performing a version of his native culture, perhaps embodying the American Indian of English imagination. The two origins of America, as it were, that clashed and commingled in Virginia, in Massachusetts, here were joined&#8211;the rejected other of the new world meets the spurned ancestral culture of the old. Yet of course both are central to the American identity. We can only wonder what this pre-English American was thinking and feeling as he stood on foreign land not sacred to him, honoring a British cultural idol, a long-dead white man.</p>
<p>Insecurity, cultural uncertainty. Voyages and explorations forged westward as Americans continued to define and re-define &#8220;the newness&#8221; (in the nineteenth-century New England phrase) of their nation. (&#8220;Tis new to thee,&#8221; Native Americans and Hispanics might have responded, like Prospero to Miranda.) And Shakespeare&#8217;s work spread with the spreading populace. Like the Bible, it became perhaps a kind of talisman of stability in a society of movement and change. Plays were performed in remote Western outposts; imitation Stratfords and Globe Theaters arose on shores and prairies from which Indians and their nature-focused ceremonies had been driven. The nation was &#8220;realizing Westward,&#8221; as Robert Frost would write, as it attempted to give embodiment to dreams of a reformed world such as those Gonzalo articulated on an alien-landscaped, imaginary island whose potential habitation&#8211;and perfection&#8211;only he could envision.</p>
<p>Westward, yes, but also perpetually returning Eastward, back across to the progenitor nation(s). The journey of Maungwudaus was only the most incongruous of many pilgrimages to Britain, where Stratford became a crucial stop on most itineraries. Jefferson and Adams visited, together. And many other political travelers made the transatlantic trek. Shakespeare&#8217;s greatest impact, however, was cultural, and pre-eminent among the literary visitors to Britain was Ralph Waldo Emerson, who heralded and promoted a new American literature while immersing himself in cultures of the past. Emerson visited England twice, in 1833 and in 1847, and wrote incisively (sometimes satirically) about it in the wonderful <em>English Traits</em> (1857). He stopped in Stratford but has little to say about it; he wasn&#8217;t a worshipper at the Shakespearean shrine. In fact, he discusses Shakespeare in ways similar to his descriptions of other British luminaries, living and dead. He refuses to be awed. While acknowledging genius, he seeks out its origin, as if to carry back to America what he once termed &#8220;energies for new creation.&#8221; He wants to locate the cultural force in Shakespeare but hopes for its emergence in new forms in the United States, which he envisions as the rebirth and fulfillment of English culture without the deadening weight of tradition.</p>
<p>It was earlier, though, in <em>Representative Men</em> (1850) that Emerson wrote most extensively about Shakespeare; the Bard is given a full chapter. This book is a series of essays on European icons, each embodying an aspect of society or culture. Shakespeare represents &#8220;the poet&#8221; not &#8220;the playwright,&#8221; perhaps because of some lingering Puritan-Colonial sense that literature should have a higher moral, spiritual or at least political significance that frivolous theater could not provide. Yet Emerson&#8217;s Shakespeare is a poet of the people and is clearly creating a new popular art form that bespeaks a new era in English life. Even though &#8220;the Puritans&#8230; and the religious within the Anglican Church would suppress them,&#8221; Emerson asserts, the people wanted plays. So Shakespeare&#8217;s genius expressed itself through drama. But it was not &#8220;original&#8221; genius, Emerson points out. Existing stories, histories, legends, plays, and journalism (writings high and low) as well as &#8220;the rude warm blood of the living England&#8221; became Shakespeare&#8217;s source material. Through his language, he made the material his own, elevated it, found &#8220;the grains of gold.&#8221; Implicitly arguing for the value of American literature and newly-forming American culture, Emerson sees in Shakespeare a kindred spirit who, undaunted by tradition, made that tradition new by reinventing it. American writers, seeking to be original, intimidated by the British canon, need only emulate the greatest figure in that canon in order to discover true originality, which consists of finding yourself in what has already been done.</p>
<p>Shakespeare is therefore a poet for a democratic age; the popular audiences of his England had their modern descendants in the far-flung crowds of all social strata who gathered to see his plays across America. His work was widely read too: Tocqueville observed that &#8220;there is hardly a pioneer&#8217;s hut which does not contain a few odd volumes of Shakespeare. I remember reading the feudal drama of Henry V for the first time in a log cabin.&#8221; Shakespeare&#8217;s popularity no doubt arose partly from an urge to (re)identify with the cultural heft of Britain, but also from his expression of universal concerns, his evocation of the common humanity even in aristocrats and kings. This commonality, Emerson suggests, comes from the fact that &#8220;what is best written or done by genius in the world was no man&#8217;s work, but came by wide social labour, when a thousand wrought like one, sharing the same impulse.&#8221; The implication here is that the greatness ascribed to extraordinary people, as well as their foibles and tragedies, belong also to each individual. Culture is a common enterprise.</p>
<p>And, as a corollary, each individual can be great. This Emersonian exhortation (which in fact dates back to &#8220;Self-Reliance&#8221;) would have a particularly strong effect on American writers, especially those influenced by history and tradition yet desiring to create new literature for a new country. To do so, he or she had to learn to negotiate carefully between the past and the present. Emerson asserts that &#8220;the generic, catholic genius, who is not afraid or ashamed to owe his originality to the originality of all, stands with the next age as the recorder and embodiment of his own.&#8221; This is a sort of paradox: those who combine originality with tradition by seeking and emulating past exemplars of originality become the representative figures of their own time. Numerous American writers of the nineteenth century (and beyond) fit this description, notably Hawthorne (who re-created the Puritan era for a Unitarian one), Melville (especially in the encyclopedic <em>Moby-Dick</em>) and Whitman (who invented a mythology of the self that tried to encompass all mythologies).<br />
In these American projects, Shakespeare is a vital underlying influence, because of his democratic inclusiveness, his original use of &#8220;found&#8221; material, and his rediscovery of the creative energies in tradition. Melville&#8217;s work in particular displays the strong presence of Shakespeare in its characters, language, and form (<em>Moby-Dick</em> includes &#8220;stage directions&#8221; and soliloquies in its vast skein of language, which echoes the Bible as well as Shakespeare). But it is Whitman who engages Shakespeare most directly, struggling to reconcile admiration for the Bard with doubts about his English penchant for aristocratic conflicts and feudal forms. This ambivalence arises from Whitman&#8217;s celebration of possibility, centered on the American land and its fostering of democratic individualism.<br />
In &#8220;Democratic Vistas&#8221; (1871), Whitman alludes to &#8220;rich Shakspere, luxuriant as the sun, artist and singer of feudalism in its sunset, with all the gorgeous colors, owner thereof, and using them at will.&#8221; He returns to Shakespeare several more times in the essay; Shakespeare is the touchstone and pinnacle of British culture and therefore to be both venerated and superseded. He is a model for the type of poet America needs&#8211;one who would discover and exalt democratic equivalents of the kings and military leaders whose triumphs and downfalls are ever-alive in Shakespeare&#8217;s dazzling language. In a later essay (1884), Whitman argues that Shakespeare&#8217;s historical plays form an &#8220;expose&#8221; of the aristocratic order that America exists to overthrow and replace. Shakespeare portrays &#8220;low&#8221; characters but focuses on the noble and the renowned, whereas Whitman&#8217;s own poetry attempts to encompass&#8211;and equalize&#8211;all levels of humanity and myriad forms of living. His democratic epic &#8220;Song of Myself&#8221; makes the common man (and woman) the heroic center, thereby carrying forward the intimations of transformed life Shakespeare offers us, especially in the late Romances like <em>The Tempest </em>and<em> The Winter&#8217;s Tale</em>. Whitman aspires to re-imagine traditional forms, as he declares in &#8220;Democratic Vistas&#8221; after describing great literary, religious, philosophical figures in history (including Shakespeare):</p>
<p>Ye powerful and resplendent ones! ye were, in your atmospheres, grown not for America, but rather for her foes, the feudal and the old&#8211;while our genius is democratic and modern. Yet could ye, indeed, but breathe your breath of life into our New World&#8217;s nostrils&#8211;not to enslave us, as now, but, for our needs, to breed a spirit like your own&#8211;perhaps (dare we say it?) to dominate, even destroy, what you yourselves have left! On your plane, and no less, but even higher and wider, must we mete and measure for today and here. I demand races of orbic bards, with unconditional, uncompromising sway. Come forth, sweet democratic despots of the west!</p>
<p>For Whitman, Shakespeare is both feudal and democratic, a burden from the British past and an inspiration for American poets. Shakespeare&#8217;s popularity in the U.S., Whitman implies, results from a dearth of great American literature, but that scarcity would soon be remedied by native writers who would celebrate the burgeoning multiplicity of the western-moving nation. Whitman&#8217;s own language blends past and present for a projected future; his cadences and usage (including the Elizabethan &#8220;ye&#8221;) evoke Shakespeare while improvising new modes of verbal expression drawn partly from common contemporary speech. (Of course, Shakespeare also drew on the vernacular, as Whitman implicitly acknowledges.) Whitman&#8217;s poetry imagines a culture that would find commonality in differing levels and kinds of society. This equalizing country, with its diverse indigenous and immigrant population, might nurture new forms of community.</p>
<p>Many other cultural and political figures in nineteenth-century America found in Shakespeare an impetus to democratic expression. Abraham Lincoln quoted Shakespeare often, especially the historical works, with their themes of testing, trial and restoration after bloodshed. Later in the century, Mark Twain would use Shakespeare (notably in <em>Huckleberry Finn</em>) both to satirize &#8220;superior&#8221; English culture and to suggest that Shakespearean conflict, comedy and tragedy abounded in everyday American life.</p>
<p>And so, as nineteenth-century America was creating a national culture, breaking away from the narrowly Puritan past while building on it, Shakespeare&#8217;s plays helped further the process of defining and understanding what kind of place this &#8220;new&#8221; country was and would be.</p>
<p>In Act II, Scene 1 of <em>The Tempest</em>, before Gonzalo makes his speech about a utopia on the island to rival the Golden Age, he and his fellow shipwrecked men banter about the qualities of the &#8220;desert&#8221; place in which they are stranded. Gonzalo perceives a near-paradise, as does Adrian, whereas Sebastian and Antonio see only a swampy, malodorous wasteland. These differing attitudes toward a new place of potential habitation arise from divergent temperaments and world-views. They might be expressions of the varied ways in which settlers regard the places they&#8217;ve landed in&#8211;these could be the colonists of Jamestown or Plymouth Plantation, both of which experienced the rigors of an inhospitable land and climate yet saw in it (the Pilgrims especially) visions of golden cities, a new Jerusalem. Like the sailors in Shakespeare, invoking Virgil, whose epic chronicled the founding of an empire, these new Americans looked to the Bible and to history to give narrative and symbolic form to what otherwise might have seemed an alien, potentially annihilating environment. Even though the Puritans would not have turned to Shakespeare, their nineteenth-century descendants certainly did, and the Virginia colony&#8211;with its Anglican roots&#8211;embraced his work much earlier.</p>
<p>Throughout Anglophone North America, the self-defined new lands found an old world affinity in Shakespeare, whose work foresaw the new while giving life to history receding into the semi-mythic past. For the United States, forming itself even as it broke apart, this combination of projected future and storied past perhaps filled multiple needs&#8211;for playacting aristocracy free of actual power, for fantasized pastoral, for the forms of history and culture America seemed to lack. Hawthorne alludes to this &#8220;lack&#8221; in his definition and defense of Romance as a genre that enhances a bleak social reality. In <em>The Blithedale Romance</em> he portrays as fiction (that is, Romance) the actual utopian experiment of Brook Farm, one of many such communal endeavors that attempted to revive the original dreams of a new kind of society going back at least to Plymouth and inspiring the American Revolution. Of course, Blithedale ultimately fails (like Brook Farm), evincing Hawthorne&#8217;s skepticism about American pastoral dreams and echoing Shakespeare&#8217;s &#8220;problem&#8221; Romances, which technically end like comedies but carry darker undertones that linger after the happy outcome.</p>
<p>By the time of Hawthorne, Melville, Emerson, and Whitman, Americans were ready to accept&#8211;and enjoy&#8211;artistic expressions of utopian hopes and disturbing, tragic history, and such expressions would of course continue into the twentieth century and beyond. Aside from the obvious Shakespearean influences on American poetry and theater, including popular adaptations, the American Shakespeare found expression in fiction and film&#8211;and not only in &#8220;literary&#8221; fiction or art film. Genre forms are perhaps even more Shakespearean in tone and theme, including the Western and, especially, science fiction and fantasy&#8211;from the science-based Asimov to the neo-Romance of Bradbury or LeGuin, traces of Shakespeare abound. Brave new worlds and grand, flawed heroism blend in these nonrealistic narratives that often interweave bold personal drama with cultural and social motifs in ways that are decidedly Shakespearean. SF film offers a multitude of examples, from the comic/heroic Star Wars to the sublime 2001, but one movie in particular stands out for its direct links back to <em>The Tempest</em>, epitomizing the Americanization of Shakespeare. In <em>Forbidden Planet</em> (1956), a starship crew sent to investigate the strange silence on a planet colony discovers two surviving colonists and a world alive with mysterious, seemingly alien presences. The movie follows the trajectory of Shakespeare&#8217;s final play while taking its themes of transformation and discovery into eerie new directions. Finally, of course, these American explorers, like the sailors in <em>The Tempest</em>, like Ishmael in Moby-Dick, discover or re-discover themselves, immersed and reborn in oceanic space, changed by a new yet already old world filled with things rich and strange.<br />

my skin reddens, blistered by the sun<br />
that shows me to be what I fear most—</p>
<p>a man along in years,<br />
a father who kept a girl safe<br />
by magic. Until that day<br />
when I can burn my books—until the end</p>
<p>of this play the gods would have with me<br />
I’ll stand and stare and feel the hours.<br />
Scoundrel, villain who wrote formulae to keep<br />
the child of a child in her rightful place,</p>
<p>I see the waves like conches turn,<br />
and hear what others listen for when they,<br />
free to travel the globe, take from its wooden shelf<br />
the sea, and put it to their ear.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>If it assume my noble father’s person,</em><br />
<em> I’ll speak to it though hell itself should gape</em><br />
<em> And bid me hold my peace.</em><br />
<strong>&#8212;</strong> <strong>Hamlet, 1.2<br />
</strong><br />
<em>I’d give up everything I got to have my dad back.</em><br />
<strong>&#8212; Dale Earnhardt Sr.</strong></p>
<p><em>The only thing I really feel strong about is that I’m going to see my daddy again. Somehow, someway, I’m going to see my daddy again.</em><br />
<strong>&#8212; Dale Earnhardt Jr.</strong></p>
<p>The ghost of Hamlet’s father rules the play. His first appearance, having occurred already when the action opens, has traumatized the sentinels on watch at Elsinore into confusing their roles. Bernardo is so spooked that, although he’s coming to relieve Francisco, he behaves as if he’s already on duty. When Bernardo asks, “Who’s there?” Francisco is quick to correct him: “Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.”</p>
<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/652/2016/03/15/return-engagement-the-haunting-of-hamlet-and-dale-earnhardt-jr/hamletghost/" rel="attachment wp-att-106"><img class="alignleft wp-image-106" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/652/files/2016/03/hamletghost-150x150.jpg" alt="hamletghost" width="252" height="252" /></a>“Who’s there?” indeed. That the father’s ghost makes his first appearance not to the son, but to watchmen guarding Elsinore, validates his existence—at least at first. Two acts later, when the Ghost returns to Hamlet as he castigates his mother for taking up with his uncle, Claudius, Queen Gertrude can’t see the apparition, although the audience can. Is the Ghost still “real”? Or just a figment of Hamlet’s imagination that we are privileged to view from his perspective? Even if its existence is objectively verifiable, what is its nature? Is he an embodiment of the elder Hamlet, as he intimates by referring to himself as Hamlet’s “father’s spirit”? Horatio avers the Ghost’s resemblance to the man himself. “I knew your father,” he says to the young Hamlet. “These hands are not more like.” Or is the apparition an evil being whose deceptive appearance masks malevolence, as Hamlet suspects in act 2 when he plans to use “The Mouse-trap” to “catch the conscience of the king”?</p>
<p>The spirit that I have seen<br />
May be a dev’l, and the dev’l hath power<br />
T’ assume a pleasing shape.</p>
<p>The Ghost’s change in appearance from act 1—where, we’re repeatedly told, he’s dressed in the armor he wore when he slew the elder Fortinbras in combat—to act 3, in which, according to one early version of the text, he reappears dressed “in his night-gown,” does little to settle the question of his benignity or malignity.</p>
<p>Whatever the Ghost’s moral make-up, his agenda—to stir his son to revenge—is as clear as his emotional manipulation is blatant. The Ghost exhorts and extorts. When he finally talks to Hamlet in the play’s fifth scene, he greases the wheels of filial devotion by relating the horrors of his confinement to purgatory, where he’s been cast, he eventually protests, by being murdered without benefit of confession. Hamlet’s grief over his father’s death is already well established; the thought of his father’s prolonged, unjust suffering can only augment his anguish and vulnerability. When the Ghost next plays upon Hamlet’s affection—“List, list, O, list! / If thou didst ever thy dear father love”—the prodigiously articulate son can only emote, “O God!” Contending that “The serpent that did sting thy father’s life / Now wears his crown,” the Ghost takes advantage of Hamlet’s disgust for his uncle. “O my prophetic soul!” responds Hamlet, who has suspected the “o’erhasty marriage” of his mother and uncle from the start and who, even before encountering the Ghost for the first time, implicates Claudius for “Foul deeds” that “will rise, / Though all the earth o’erwhelm them, to men’s eyes.”</p>
<p>The word disposition recurs throughout Hamlet in reference to a character’s state of mind, inclination, or perspective. If Hamlet is disposed toward believing Claudius capable of murdering the king, he is also passionate about communing once more with his deceased father. The universal longing of a child to retrieve a lost parent is no doubt more “particular” in Hamlet’s case, to use Gertrude’s word, because the parent died prematurely and unexpectedly. All at once, Hamlet finds himself coping with his father’s death, his mother’s precipitous entrance into a marriage considered incestuous at the time, and, thanks to Claudius’ maneuvering, the frustration of his succession to Denmark’s throne and yet the sense that, if “the time is out of joint,” he must “set it right.”</p>
<p>Among its many accomplishments and contributions, Hamlet avails the audience a wrenchingly realistic glimpse of a son mourning his father. To understand the frame of mind and emotional condition of perhaps the most consummate, most enigmatical, and best known fictional character ever created is to begin appreciating Dale Earnhardt Jr.’s circumstances upon his father’s shocking fatality, at age forty-nine, during the 2001 Daytona 500. If Hamlet elucidates the Earnhardt family’s drama, moreover, the illumination works both ways: Dale Sr., aka “The Intimidator” and “The Man in Black,” is but one in a cast of living characters who enrich our view of fictional persons like those in Hamlet. Dale Sr.’s father, Ralph, known as “Ironheart” (whence derives reference to his son as “Ironhead”) is another such character. He too died abruptly and young, of a heart attack, at forty-five, leaving Dale to make his own way toward becoming NASCAR’s reigning monarch.</p>
<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/652/2016/03/15/return-engagement-the-haunting-of-hamlet-and-dale-earnhardt-jr/dale/" rel="attachment wp-att-107"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-107" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/652/files/2016/03/dale-150x150.jpg" alt="dale" width="150" height="150" /></a>Extraordinary circumstances, like royalty of any sort, can both obscure and complicate the common humanity of losing a parent. Beneath Hamlet’s princely position is a male adolescent undergoing all of the familial, sexual, and personal confusion of a college student. In 2001, Dale Jr. said of losing Dale Sr., “Since he died, people have tried to make it sound . . . theatrical, but we were pretty much like any other father and son.” Yet both figures’ public roles exempt them from the ordinary. Of all modern sports, NASCAR is the most dominated by family dynasties, and, as King Hamlet’s son, Prince Hamlet is “to the manner born.” Their individual stories share the element of private trauma overlapping with their lineage and the public exposure it brings. But most crucial of all for both sons is, arguably, their emotional dependency upon fathers of public prominence, questionable reliability and integrity, and daunting expectations of their offspring. King Hamlet and Dale Earnhardt Sr. exercise extraordinary control in general, but especially over their sons’ sense of obligation.</p>

<em>There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,</em><br />
<em> Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.</em><br />
<strong>&#8212; Hamlet, 1.5<br />
</strong><br />
<em>Shakespeare was born too soon.</em><br />
<em>&#8212;</em> <strong>Detective Andrew Yancy, in Carl Hiasson’s <em>Bad Monkey</em></strong></p>
<p>The multiple ambiguities about the Ghost in Hamlet are partly what Shakespeare scholar Elihu Pearlman has in mind when he cites Shakespeare’s innovation in his essay “Shakespeare at Work: The Invention of the Ghost.” Shakespeare’s ghost is but one of several that populated Elizabethan revenge tragedy, including an earlier, now lost, version of Hamlet. As the instigator of revenge, the stage ghost derived from the early first-century Roman playwright Seneca, whose closet dramas include Phaedre and Thyestes, the latter a felt presence in Shakespeare’s gory Titus Andronicus. Pearlman argues that Shakespeare transformed the earlier stage ghost—a nearly laughable, hardly scary, strident phantom—into an entity made truly terrifying by virtue of his very life-likeness. The ghoul that Elizabethan audiences were expecting was replaced, says Pearlman, by a more human figure with “almost a ghost-next-door quality.”</p>
<p>Still, the play keeps open from the start the crucial possibility that the Ghost is every bit the blood-thirsty monster that his literary predecessors proved to be. Horatio initially reads the Ghost as a “guilty thing,” although Hamlet assures Horatio and others upon first encountering the spirit himself that “It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.” Yet the veracity of the Ghost’s account of his murder isn’t established until much later—in act 3, when Claudius confesses to the murder in the audience’s, but not Hamlet’s, hearing. Until that point, Shakespeare’s audience is as unsure as Hamlet about whether the Ghost’s story is “honest,” and, although Hamlet thinks he’s proven Claudius’s guilt when his uncle is perturbed by “The Mouse Trap,” Hamlet never has certain evidence of such guilt. Even if he did, though, the validity of the Ghost’s command to “Revenge this most unnatural and foul murther” would remain debatable. The Ghost’s revelation of a true crime doesn’t in itself justify Hamlet’s avenging it.</p>
<p>The Ghost’s several injunctions concerning revenge, moreover, create a moral maze for the protagonist. Bewailing his lot in purgatory as “horrible, O horrible, most horrible!” the Ghost appeals to the son’s sense of responsibility for relieving his father’s anguish: “If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.” The Ghost then adds to the list of the prince’s tasks that of addressing the seamy entanglement of his mother and Claudius—“Let not the royal bed of Denmark be / A couch for luxury and damned incest”—while tacking on the contradictory prohibition, “Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive / Against thy mother aught.” Hamlet, then, is supposed to intervene in his mother’s sexual behavior on his deceased father’s behalf while remaining pure of thought and letting “heaven” deal with her through “those thorns” of conscience “that in her bosom lodge,” which ought “To prick and sting her.” Seriously?</p>
<p>That Shakespeare himself took the role of the Ghost in performance is a well known historical supposition that teases curiosity without yielding clear meaning. One implication of the pairing is thematic: the play’s creator aligns himself with the progenitor of revenge. Both are, in a sense, fathers; both direct the action. Shakespeare extends his authority by indulging in some self-conscious metatheatrical play when, having returned to “purgatory” via a trap door on the stage floor, the Ghost continues to make his presence known from what Hamlet calls the “cellarage”—that is, the physical space beneath the stage. The reference calls attention to the artificiality of the staging with a dry humor that persists as the Ghost backs up Hamlet’s efforts to swear his companions to secrecy about what they’ve just seen. “Swear,” thunders the Ghost from below the stage. “Well said, old mole,” responds Hamlet in approbation. Upon the Ghost’s third warning to “Swear,” Hamlet’s fellows obey, as they probably would have done sooner had they not been comically stricken with astonishment.</p>
<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/652/2016/03/15/return-engagement-the-haunting-of-hamlet-and-dale-earnhardt-jr/dalesr/" rel="attachment wp-att-283"><img class="alignright wp-image-283" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/652/files/2016/03/dalesr-240x300.jpg" alt="dalesr" width="167" height="209" /></a>Throughout act 1, Shakespeare, with a dash of self-parody, establishes the Ghost’s free agency and self-possession, as suggested in the very first scene when Horatio and his fellows fail to exert control over the spirit’s speech and movement. Horatio’s futile order to the Ghost—“Stay, illusion!”—is ludicrous in its self-contradiction. When the Ghost moves to exit and Horatio directs the officer Marcellus to “Stop it,” Marcellus wryly replies, “Shall I strike it with my partisan?” Impervious to human power of any sort, the Ghost secures total mastery.</p>
<p>Conjuring fear one moment and amusement the next, alternately signaling “wicked” and “charitable” “intents,” the Ghost’s fluctuating character hints of similar mixed traits about the living king and his bellicose milieu. In particular, King Hamlet’s portrayal as a warrior suggests the positive attributes of a vanquisher and of Denmark’s defender, but also negative associations with excessive violence. Horatio explains before Prince Hamlet’s first appearance that Fortinbras, King of Norway, “prick’d on by a most emulate pride,” once “Dar’d” Hamlet’s father “to the combat.” When King Hamlet defeated King Fortinbras, adds Horatio, the latter “Did forfeit (with his life) all those his lands / Which he stood seiz’d of, to the conqueror.”</p>
<p>Horatio’s apparent admiration for the “valiant” king notwithstanding, King Hamlet’s embroilment with Fortinbras, his double of sorts, has initiated a dubious cycle of retribution. As the play opens, Elsinore is arming itself against the anticipated attack of the younger Fortinbras, yet a third competitor, whom Horatio describes as one “Of unimproved mettle hot and full.” Fortinbras fils “Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there / Shark’d up a list of lawless resolutes” whose apparent mission is “to recover of us, by strong hand / And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands / So by his father lost.” “Strong hand” is another of Shakespeare’s inside jokes: the name Fortinbras literally translates from French as “strong arm.” But the reference is of a piece with the broader portrait of Fortinbras as a thug, a hothead whose rage for acquiring lands is as indiscriminate as a shark’s feeding frenzy.</p>
<p>Although Horatio foists blame on the Fortinbras clan for their aggression, King Hamlet’s willingness to be “Dar’d” in the first place makes him a co-conspirator in the conflict that has led to Norway’s current threat. But the Ghost’s call to Hamlet to avenge his murder on Claudius even more flagrantly invokes the cyclical violence that the ongoing Hamlet / Fortinbras struggle frames. The Ghost’s sense of injustice is compelling, to be sure. He was cheated, he submits, “Of life, of crown, of queen” by a “wretch whose natural gifts were poor / To those of mine!” However legitimate the Ghost’s complaints of foul play and Hamlet’s indignity at his uncle’s usurpation, though, the efficacy of revenge to right past wrongs is a prospect riddled with doubt, not least because of its invitation to further violence.</p>
<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/652/2016/03/15/return-engagement-the-haunting-of-hamlet-and-dale-earnhardt-jr/hamswordfight/" rel="attachment wp-att-109"><img class="alignleft wp-image-109" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/652/files/2016/03/hamswordfight-150x150.jpg" alt="hamswordfight" width="252" height="252" /></a>Yet however morally ill-advised revenge might be, the creature demanding it has an extraordinary—yes, haunting—grip on the protagonist. To fulfill the Ghost’s command is also to win the father’s approval, and what son wouldn’t crave esteem from a father who died before his son had the chance to show his worth? Hamlet is at once beholden to and trapped by the Ghost. Either to ignore or follow the apparition’s charge somehow spells guilt. Hamlet’s notorious, multi-faceted psychological and emotional instability, liberally observed over the centuries, traces to the Ghost’s grip on his heart and mind.</p>
<p>By all reports, Dale Earnhardt Sr. displayed every bit the warrior’s spirit, confounding mix of traits, and influence on his son that characterize King Hamlet. He was and has remained as worshipped an icon as the elder Hamlet, miniature pictures of whom, Prince Hamlet tells Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, once garnered “twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats a-piece.” The phenomenal record that elevated Earnhardt in life and canonized him in death was undergirded by preternatural racing talent. In one account of his driving at Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, Dale came so close to a wall as to shave the ivy growing on it without damaging the car. Added to that raw ability was a legendary determination. To the consternation of his fellow racers, he would do anything, including wrecking someone else’s car, to win. “That’s stepping over the line,” commented Darrell Waltrip on such reckless, self-serving disregard. Richard Petty, a member of another NASCAR dynasty, knew firsthand Dale’s “guts and guile.” “He didn’t worry about finesse,” Petty remembers in Sportscentury’s documentary on Earnhardt. Observes fellow driver Cale Yarborough with his own lack of finesse, “It’d be hard to castrate him with a chain saw.” “He literally had no fear,” adds NASCAR’s Benny Parsons. Rather, he was governed, says Dan Fowler, narrating the documentary, by a “passion for risk” and the “need to control everything around him.” Earnhardt’s rough aggression, akin to King Hamlet’s pagan heroism, seemed to date to an earlier time. Dale Sr. was no one to turn down a “dare.”</p>
<p>That Earnhart had one face for his competitors and another for his public is repeatedly validated in statements among those who knew him. Jeff Byrd, President of Bristol Motor Speedway until his death in 2010, said that Dale “had the best smile you’ve ever seen and the worst stare you’ve ever seen.” Sportscaster Whit Watson tells of Dale’s being interviewed on camera, flashing that best smile while grinding his steel-toed boot into a reporter’s foot. He could cow reporters with a verbal skill akin to Hamlet’s ghost. Dan Fowler elaborates on Earnhardt’s dark playfulness: “what may have begun as mischief became black comedy, as an atmosphere of danger, played out under the guise of humor.” Some of those who knew him off the track bear witness to a third face, reserved for his intimates. Especially around his daughters, Kelley and Taylor, he was a “big softie,” says news anchor Brian Williams of his friend. Darrell Waltrip concedes that, in private, Dale was a “real human being,” but quickly qualifies that description: “The rest [of] the time, he was an animal.”</p>
<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/652/2016/03/15/return-engagement-the-haunting-of-hamlet-and-dale-earnhardt-jr/nascar/" rel="attachment wp-att-110"><img class="alignleft wp-image-110" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/652/files/2016/03/nascar-150x150.jpg" alt="nascar" width="315" height="315" /></a>Father-son cycles pertain as prominently to the Earnhardts as to the Hamlet and Fortinbras clans. Earnhardt’s interviews often identified his father, Ralph, as his inspiration and instigation. In 1987, to Sam Moses at <em>Sports Illustrated</em>, he said, “I love racing. . . . It was born and bred in me by my daddy, and that’s why I’m so good at it. Racing comes just like breathing to me. It’s always going to be there, like my damn heartbeat.” Ralph taught his son by both precept and example. “Establish your territory,” he told Dale, advice that Robert Edelstein, in <em>NASCAR Generations</em>, says, “would go a long way toward defining [Dale’s] driving style.” Earnhardt himself illustrated the point with a story told in Leigh Montville’s book <em>At the Altar of Speed</em>, published a few months after the fatal crash. At the Metrolina Speedway near Charlotte, both father and son were fighting to take the lead. “I’m fourth,” recounted Dale.</p>
<p>I still can’t get by the guy [who’s third]. He’s too fast. With a few laps to<br />
go, I see Daddy come up behind me. He’s lapping me. I move over to let him<br />
pass, but Daddy moves with me. He comes up on my bumper! He starts pushing<br />
me! He pushes me past the other guy! Daddy wins! I finish third. The other<br />
guy, fourth, is so mad, complaining everywhere about “those Earnhardts,”<br />
but there’s nothing he can do. It’s over.</p>
<p>So was rooted the Earnhardts’ reputation for ruthlessness. Montville quotes family acquaintance Freddie Smith remarking on Ralph’s tutelage of Dale. “I’d see him showing Dale things at the old Concord [North Carolina] dirt track. . . . Ralph would be in one car, Dale in another. Ralph would be pushing him deep into corners from behind, showing him what to do.” The outcome of Ralph’s instruction was, of course, Earnhardt’s domination of NASCAR.</p>
<p>Although Dale’s dropping out of school after failing eighth grade created a deep rift between Ralph and son, they eventually reconciled to the extent that Ralph’s sudden death devastated Dale, who then was twenty-two. “Sometimes, late at night,” Dale once said, “I would sit down and cry for an hour without stopping.” Reports Montville on Ralph’s lingering presence in Dale’s life, “When he was working on his car, he found himself talking to Ralph, asking how to fix that carburetor or what gear he should be using.” Whatever the ultimate extent of Ralph’s effect on Dale’s performance, he felt his father’s absence as his victories and firsts mounted. Montville represents Dale’s recurring longing to share his conquests with his father through an imagined inner dialogue.</p>
<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/652/2016/03/15/return-engagement-the-haunting-of-hamlet-and-dale-earnhardt-jr/dalesr/" rel="attachment wp-att-283"><img class="alignright wp-image-283" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/652/files/2016/03/dalesr-240x300.jpg" alt="dalesr" width="173" height="216" /></a>What if Daddy hadn’t died? . . . If Ralph had only lived until he was fifty-one, he would have seen his son become Rookie of the Year and then a Winston Cup champion. . . . what if he could have seen it all? Wouldn’t that have been the biggest kick there was?</p>
<p>Such influence of father on son has been almost eerily recapitulated in the history of Dale Sr. and Dale Jr. Sports journalist Lars Anderson, reflecting on over a decade of following Dale Jr., takes as an article of faith that Dale Jr.’s “father will continue to shadow him, ghostlike, for the rest of his life.” The two Dales hadn’t been close during Dale Jr.’s childhood because of Sr.’s relentless racing schedule. “I missed him bad sometimes,” Dale Jr. has said, “but when he was around, it was great.” Like Hamlet, Dale had also gone away to school—in his case, to military school because of bad behavior. Whether or not the desire to connect with his father was his primary attraction to NASCAR, Jr. surprised Sr. by entering his world. “I never thought Dale Jr. was going to be a race driver,” Dale Sr. once confessed. “He never seemed to have the interest.” But even before the accident, younger Dale described racing as his conduit to the father he was still just getting to know. “My racing is all for my daddy,” he said in his early days as a driver. “I don’t care much about anything else.”</p>
<p>Former Charlotte Motor Speedway president and manager Humpy (Howard) Wheeler, whose intimacy with the Earnhardts dates to when he worked for Firestone and Ralph was his test-driver, saw just that filial aspiration in Dale Jr. “He loved his dad to death,” Wheeler tells me during a long conversation one late summer afternoon. “All Dale Jr. ever wanted to do was drive a car, just like his father.” I ask Wheeler about Dale Sr.’s disposition as Jr.’s father; he responds, without hesitation, “old school.” “He was really tough with Jr.,” Wheeler explains, “just exactly like his father was with him.” Some of Sr.’s lessons stuck with his son as Ralph’s had with him. When Charlie Rose asked Jr. what a NASCAR winner needs, he replied, “fearlessness, guts, . . . tenacity and determination.”<br />
Competition between the two generations would necessarily spring, then, from this father’s expectations of this son. In one instance, a 1999 IROC event in Michigan, Sr. and Jr. vied for fifty laps, the elder finally eking out first place by mere inches. About the thrill of the father-son triumph, Dale Sr. said, “To be racing your son on a track at the speeds that we were, that’s a pretty awesome feeling . . . . I don’t think you could top it.” If the son was indeed seeking approval through competing on the father’s turf, he won that adulation, too. “I’m proud of him, you know, of his capabilities,” said father of son, “but I’m just proud of him as a dad.” While that pride was, as far as we know, more than Hamlet ever heard from his father, it was cut short when Dale Sr. lost his life at Daytona in 2001.</p>
<p>The accident involved a final racetrack competition between the two Dales, a circumstance that, although it has received little attention in the event’s coverage to date, is the stuff of rich narrative. Dale Jr. was racing for Dale Earnhardt, Inc. (DEI) in a contest that had already involved a nineteen-car pileup. Several cars were totaled, but no one was seriously injured. In the final lap, Dale Jr. was in second place, behind Michael Waltrip, who was also driving for DEI, and Dale Sr., representing Richard Childress, was battling for third with long-term rival and friend Kenny Schrader. On Turn 3, Sterling Marlin tapped Dale Sr., causing him to run into a wall at a forty-five-degree angle, at which point Schrader couldn’t avoid hitting him directly. As one account puts it, “The two slid down the track and into the infield grass. Schrader quickly jumped out. Earnhardt did not.”</p>
<p>Humpy Wheeler shared with me his understanding of exactly how Earnhardt died, adding that the information had never before been made public. Although reports to date have blamed Earnhardt’s faulty seat belt, Wheeler said, Earnhardt, who had a penchant for working on his own seat, had improperly reinstalled the belt, which was chafing against hard metal. In an accident that Wheeler contends was otherwise “innocuous,” the seat belt snapped.</p>
<p>While some witnesses believe Dale Sr. was behaving true to form by trying to edge out his son, the majority, including Dale Jr., interpret Sr.’s driving not as offensive, but as defensive of Jr.’s second-place position, as well as Waltrip’s first place, and, thus, DEI’s standing. Dale Sr. may have felt torn between securing his own victory or enabling his son and team to win, and Dale Jr. is potentially enmeshed in feeling responsible for, if not guilty about, his father’s death. Until 1998, when Dale Sr. won the Daytona 500 after nineteen previous failures to do so, that race had been his holy grail. To have forfeited his own position to his son in this particular instance would be a grand gesture. To die while doing so, leaving Dale Jr. in second place, would, at the least, render his son indebted and, at most, invest him in making his father’s death matter through proving, now more than ever, his own worth.</p>

<em>You have a great heart. It’s going to stay with you throughout.</em><br />
<strong>&#8212;</strong> <strong>Dale Earnhardt, Jr., “Note to Self”</strong></p>
<p><em>Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince . . . .</em><br />
<strong>&#8212; Horatio, 5.2</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/652/2016/03/15/return-engagement-the-haunting-of-hamlet-and-dale-earnhardt-jr/oldghost/" rel="attachment wp-att-285"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-285" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/652/files/2016/03/oldghost-300x134.jpg" alt="oldghost" width="300" height="134" /></a>“I miss my father,” Dale Jr. once said in an interview, “and I’ve cried for him, but my own selfish pity is the reason for those emotions. I just try to remember that he’s in a better place.” The sense that proving manhood involves controlling emotions evokes Hamlet’s impatience with his own hesitation to kill Claudius, which he views as “pigeon-liver’d”; he castigates himself for being like a “whore,” who must “unpack my heart with words,” rather than actions. Dale Jr. shares with Prince Hamlet the abiding pressure to perform stoically as a way to retrieve, commune with, and even atone for fallen fathers whose lives perplexingly intermingled the intrepid and the questionable. The dramas ensuing from their losses, moreover, yield uncannily similar elements, including troubled relationships with mothers, animosity toward uncles, and choices played out, often uncomfortably and stultifyingly, in full public view.</p>
<p>Hamlet’s Oedipal preoccupation with his mother has become, post Freud and Laurence Olivier’s film version of the play, one of its most celebrated, although often overblown, aspects. If not primary among his motivations for wanting Claudius dead, it’s certainly on the list. The public knows a great deal less about Dale’s relationship with his natural mother, Brenda Gee Earnhardt Jackson, than about his vexed relationship with his step-mother, Teresa. Yet in the “Note to Self” he made for CBS News, he announces his mother’s importance to him. “Her love is a truly unconditional kind. You shouldn’t take it for granted.”</p>
<p>Teresa Earnhardt (formerly Houston) is a different matter. “One of the most interesting dramas here is Teresa,” ventures Humpy Wheeler. Although both Dale Jr. and his sister Kelley praised Teresa’s handling of DEI in the months directly following Dale Sr.’s death, eventually they reached an impasse. “When Dale died,” Wheeler recounts, “the family pulled together—except Teresa. Teresa became rather . . . uck.” Wheeler speculates that, in the division of property that followed the funeral, Teresa likely favored Taylor, her child with Earnhardt, over her three stepchildren.</p>
<p>So far Teresa lacks Gertrude’s subsequent romantic involvement, but her management of the family business, like Gertrude’s extended reign as queen of Denmark, smacks of usurpation. Dale’s move from his father’s racing team to Hendrick Motorsports in 2008, resulting from an acrid dispute over his contract with DEI, formally acknowledged the estrangement from Teresa. Lars Anderson’s statement that “The reason Dale Jr. left DEI can be summed up in two words: Teresa Earnhardt” must derive in part from Dale’s own words to Anderson, “Me and Teresa do not see eye to eye.”</p>
<p>About four years after his move to Hendrick’s team, Dale fired his uncle, Tony Eury, once his crew chief and, later, the competition director of JR Motorsports, an arm of Hendrick Motorsports. Soon thereafter, Eury’s son and Dale’s cousin, Tony Jr., left the enterprise as Dale’s crew chief. Although the separation from the Eurys appeared amicable enough, Dale and Kelley foregrounded the team’s poor performance record at the time. It all came down to the business of winning, maintained the Earnhardts, and the Eurys weren’t delivering. In any event, the Eurys’ departure completed the purgation of extended family from the organization’s core.</p>
<p>Much as the son wanted to follow the father’s path, Wheeler notes a marked difference in work ethic between generations. Speaking of Sr., Wheeler recalls, “He’d get up at five friggin’ o’clock in the mornin’.” Jr., however, prefers sleeping late, “lolly-gagging,” and hanging out with friends. (His house incorporates a night club that accommodates two hundred people.) “He just wanted to have fun,” Wheeler tells me. “I don’t think Sr. ever had any fun.”</p>
<p>From Wheeler’s perspective, Dale Sr.’s death dealt a blow not just to his devoted fans, but to the very fan base of NASCAR, a blow from which stock car racing has yet to recover. No one, in Wheeler’s opinion, has stepped up to take Sr.’s place and renew fans’ investment in the sport itself. While Dale Jr. has demonstrated appeal by winning NASCAR’s Most Popular Driver Award thirteen times, he hasn’t become the racer his dad was, even considering his 2014 win at Daytona and other recent successes. Says Wheeler, “Everybody loves Jr. because he’s so humble. He’s very nice to people,” adding that Sr. was “type A” and Jr. is “type B.” “I’ve never seen Jr. get mad at the racetrack,” adds Wheeler, whereas he’d often seen Sr. mad enough “to rip the hood off a car.” What Jr. lacks in fierce competitive spirit, he may well redeem in character.</p>
<p>One could possibly make a similar observation about Hamlet’s disposition: the scruples that seem to stand between him and avenging his father’s death may portray him as a more admirable, amiable sort than either the Ghost or King Hamlet. Claudius reveals that his subjects love his nephew so much as to take his “gyves” for “graces”—his antics for strengths. But such a reading competes with dozens of other inferences concerning myriad issues, including the ease with which Hamlet sheds Polonius’s blood, causing the emotional breakdown of the slain lord’s daughter, Ophelia, whom Hamlet insists at one point he has loved. How ethically aware is he, after all? And what of the problematic way in which he finally satisfies the Ghost’s injunction to kill Claudius? When Hamlet slays his uncle at the play’s end, is he even avenging his father’s death, or his mother’s and / or his own? Is his action deliberate or impulsive, willful and wrong or fated and sanctioned by a higher power? Wherein, exactly, does the Prince’s tragic quality lie: in nobly, if belatedly, accomplishing his father’s behest or in failing to appreciate how the Ghost has misled him down a dark, dark alley?</p>
<p>At the end of a play that has been driven by the Ghost’s story, Hamlet urges Horatio to choose life over suicide so that he can, in turn, narrate Hamlet’s own story. Hamlet’s emotionally charged language to Horatio recalls his father’s words to him, suggesting yet another cycle:</p>
<p>If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,<br />
Absent thee from felicity a while,<br />
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain</p>
<p>To tell my story. The audience doesn’t know whether Horatio will survive Fortinbras’ occupation of Denmark to do Hamlet’s bidding, nor how he himself might represent the events—the “purposes mistook, / Fall’n on the inventors’ heads”—we’ve just witnessed in the preceding play. Indeed, the world Hamlet leaves behind requires spying, eavesdropping, and subterfuge to learn much of anything about the characters’ inner dispositions.</p>
<p>Hamlet’s protectiveness toward his biography, over which he has little control, resonated with me on the October morning I visited Martha Earnhardt, Ralph’s widow and Dale Sr.’s mother, at her home in Kannapolis. She had, just two months earlier, lost another son, Randy, to cancer, all the more reason for me to exercise care in speaking with her about the family whose private life is shrouded by fame. Although I longed to ask her penetrating questions, I didn’t interview her, only paid my respects. The next day, while touring the public spaces in JR Motorsports, Dale Jr. and Kelley’s joint venture, I was intercepted by Cathy Earnhardt Watkins, Dale Sr.’s sister, who already knew of my meeting with her mother and expressed understandable concern over Martha’s having talked with a stranger alone.</p>
<p>As I apologized and assured her I hadn’t taken advantage of her mother, I looked around at the Earnhardt hats, mugs, key chains, tee shirts, and dozens more branded items that tacitly represent the family legend. And I thought to myself how, oddly, most of us know more about the fictional Hamlet than about the nonfictional Dale Earnhardt Jr. Yet the more we know about Hamlet, the less we understand for certain. In plumbing the intricacies of fathers and sons, Hamlet offers the reminder that often our “deep plots do pall”—the story we construct is itself a kind of ghost, likely less reliable than we suppose.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ingénue</strong></p>
<p>She was Hero to his Claudio that season, and what a season to remember. Olivia could still recall when she first met the actor who&#8217;d been cast as her opposite; he had all the dazzle and verve that a Claudio should possess. His eyes snapped with passion—good looks were a given—but he wasn&#8217;t too threatening to overshadow the Benedick or the Don Pedro. It was an ensemble production, after all, and everyone had to share the attention.</p>
<p>It was inevitable that they would sleep together, a bore of predictability even for the two of them. Their chemistry was palpable, as it needed to be, and they didn&#8217;t even get through the days of the dry readings before they were shagging anywhere they could: behind the set pieces, in the park on the way to the pub or in the alleyway next to the stage door after a particularly heady run. Those days were magic, and Olivia still smiled when she thought of the rush. Like a comet, they had blazed brilliant and fast in an arc so bright it could burn, only meant for the moment.</p>
<p>She&#8217;d played Juliet a few times after that and once, Ophelia, but she&#8217;d never been any of the real titans of the stage. She&#8217;d left before she&#8217;d graduated to the greats such as Lady MacBeth or Desdemona. Not many made it that far, and by then the spotlights were beginning to glare a little too harshly and the makeup crumbled or lay too thick on her cheeks, revealing the fine network of lines that started to show under the greasepaint. The tricks of the trade were revealed to be just that, and the delight that youth brought had somehow evaporated along the way. The old words were tired on her lips, the applause a trifle too polite. It had been so long since she even remembered why she played dress-up and recited a dead-man&#8217;s words to an audience full of children who just wanted to cut class for the afternoon. That had never been her dream. <em>What is her dream, again?</em></p>
<p>Olivia left the business and only brought out the costumes for Renaissance Faires. After the girls were born, they wouldn&#8217;t quite lace up in the back anymore, and the circlets looked foolish or worse upon hair that had been sensibly shorn and was beginning to show signs of gray. Olivia relegated them to the basement, where all memories of youth were kept.</p>
<p>The gowns came out at Halloween and for dress-up, and by then Olivia didn&#8217;t feel the stab that always used to follow when she caught sight of what might have been. She&#8217;d heard from someone that Robert was still treading the boards, and had even had quite a bit of success through the years at the old Festival. His name meant something there. He was a star of the stage. Or as close as an actor not in films could be.</p>
<p>Olivia frowned and remembered what it was like to stand before the expectant crowd, when things were good. When the people waited with bated breath to hear not so much what she would say, but how she would say it. When they were entranced with her gestures, her manner and the flair that only she could bring to the act. When the men drank in the sight of her from their seats, gilded by the glow of the stage lights, and the women admired her grace. Olivia sifted through her thoughts and tried to bring forth a soliloquy, a reading, anything from all those years, but her mind drew a blank.</p>
<p>“For my heart is exceeding heavy &#8230;” Olivia could only remember that bare snippet, nothing more. It was an endless refrain in her mind, but whether it was lament or warning she couldn&#8217;t tell, nor was she in the mood to decipher the vagaries of her faulty memory. They said an actor&#8217;s lines stuck with them forever and that the text never faded, but then <em>they </em>said a lot of things that turned out to be rubbish. Olivia brushed the crown from her head and packed it away with the gowns that were beginning to show signs of age and moths. She taped up the box and put away the yellowing scripts. There was no time for nonsense now. This was her life, and regret was for someone else.</p>
<p>Olivia heaved the box onto the top shelf, out of sight, but not quite out of mind.</p>
<p><strong>We Lay Our Scene</strong></p>
<p>“I still don&#8217;t get this part. Can you explain the Nurse&#8217;s motivation here? Why would she procure a ladder here? Isn&#8217;t she trying to <em>protect </em>Juliet? That doesn&#8217;t seem very nurse-like to me. I need more to go on. Can we have another conference so that I can really <em>feel </em>what it would be like to be inside her head like that?”</p>
<p>Jim pinched the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger. “We&#8217;ve been through this, Kerry. Just do what you think is best. It&#8217;s actually not that big of a part.”</p>
<p>“What?” Kerry frowned. “How can you say that? It&#8217;s a very big part! All of Juliet&#8217;s moral foundation rests on the Nurse.”</p>
<p>Jim sighed. “Then do what you do best: act. I leave the interpretation in your capable hands.”</p>
<p>“But—”</p>
<p>“Act three, Scene five. From the top!” Jim cut her off. He knew the Nurse was in that scene, and he sighed in relief as Kerry waddled off to find her cue.</p>
<p>God save him from actors. Jim watched the action on stage, but it barely registered. He hated this play. He hated them all by now. This was his fifth production of <em>Romeo and Juliet,</em> and it was getting more detestable every time he staged it. He was cursed with a gay Romeo and a goth Juliet this time around. What was wrong with kids these days? He groaned and ripped the foil off an antacid tablet. He was getting old. The fact that he was directing a play full of love and hope and could actually think about &#8216;kids these days&#8217; ought to be a sign that he was the wrong man for the job. But he kept churning them out, year after year.</p>
<p>It hadn&#8217;t always been like that. There had been a time, so long ago now he could hardly remember it that it had taken on a sepia glow even in his own memories, that he&#8217;d <em>wanted </em>to be here. Jim laughed. Had he ever been a passionate man? Yes, back when the words meant something, when he had vision and a full head of hair. He vaguely remembered wanting to put on a play and show the audience that there could still be relevance and so much significance to be found in tradition. He had wanted to set the world on fire and show the audience what <em>he </em>saw.</p>
<p>Then he had met the actors. The endless stream of actors, who liked to think they were all so frigging different and creative, but Jim could tell them a thing or two about that. They were all the same: egotistical. They were the most selfish, self-centered lot of any bunch he&#8217;d come across, and over the years, he&#8217;d had to battle every line of his plays with them. They all had an “idea” about how they wanted to play their own Cleopatras and Caesars, but they couldn&#8217;t see the bigger picture. They could only see their own reflection in the mirror, and it drove him mad. They were an unending procession of arrogant, squabbling children.</p>
<p>Jim sighed. “That was good, but Lady Montague, you need to be downstage more in the second half of the scene. We&#8217;ve gone over this. At this point, you need to know your blocking, please.”</p>
<p>“I know, Jim, but I still think that the lighting is bad for my speech. Can&#8217;t I be upstage just a tad more?” Evangeline pouted.</p>
<p>Jim gritted his teeth. “If you&#8217;re upstage, then Kristin will be muffled. And Juliet has important lines here, yes? Take it from &#8216;the villain Romeo&#8217;, and do it the way I directed you.”</p>
<p>He hadn&#8217;t envisioned the fighting. He hadn&#8217;t known that over the years they would wear him into this tired caricature of an old man. He was a stooped husk of a person in a cardigan, for pity&#8217;s sake! Jim had a vague recollection of wearing a beret at one point in his life when that sort of thing was cool, but now he was invisible, popping blood-pressure meds and more worried about his stress level than if the foreshadowing at the end of scene three was too blatant.</p>
<p>He hadn&#8217;t wanted to be this person. He wanted to be hopeful, not this jaded shell. He&#8217;d gone into this line of work for that very reason, not to have his ideals leeched away. He wished there was someone to blame for his indifference. It would be nice to have a villain here. In Shakespeare, things were always so defined. He wanted to have a duel with his enemy and shriek “It was you! You are responsible for the death of my art!” and be justified. A good swordfight seemed awfully cathartic. Yet when he looked around, there he was in the same darkened theater. The seasons had rolled by him heavier each year. The audience clapped just as heartily, no matter what he staged, whether it be his best effort or his worst. There were the same actors with different faces, waiting for him to guide them so that they could ignore him in the end.</p>
<p>“Well, death&#8217;s the end of it <em>all</em>,” Kerry said.</p>
<p>Jim winced. Her tone was too strident and melodramatic for the Nurse. She was trying to overshadow Juliet again, and it didn&#8217;t take much because Kristin was about as lackluster a Juliet as they&#8217;d had. Jim was about to mention it, but he just sat back. Did it matter, in the end? Did the audience know the difference between a good production and a bad one? The thought had steadily depressed him for years. He had an ulcer in his gut that would fit a golf ball, but Jim was finally finished worrying. As he watched the actors waltz around and butcher the play, he decided he couldn&#8217;t take it anymore. He was contractually obligated to direct next season&#8217;s <em>Hamlet</em> with Robert St. Vincent—that ass—and then he would retire.</p>
<p>“And … scene!” called Lucy, the lighting director. “You want to run it another time? Should I cue up the balcony scene?”</p>
<p>“Nope.” Jim smiled, thinking of the property in North Carolina his wife had been on him to buy for a couple of years now. He could almost feel the sun on his face already. Let Kerry upstage Kristin. What did he care? He had a new life ahead. He just had to get through one more season. “I&#8217;ve seen everything I need to.”</p>
<p><strong>Cue for Passion</strong></p>
<p>“If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart … ” Robert let his voice swell and choke just a little with emotion. This was it; this was where he hooked them. “And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain … ” He could hear hushed sobbing from a lady in the front row. He let his voice lose strength and falter as he gave the last line. He could almost feel every eye in the house unblinking and trained on him. He lived for this very moment. Never had he felt so alive as when he was dying. “The rest is silence.”</p>
<p>The applause was thunderous. Robert waited until the stage fell dark, exit stage left. Hamlet&#8217;s miraculous resurrection for curtain call twice a day and a matinée on Saturdays was a huge commercial success as well as a professional one.</p>
<p>By the time he made his appearance, his high was already waning. Shouts and stamps, whistles for the star of the show were nice, but nothing could top the zenith that had them all spellbound. Though they were clapping for him, their attention was already dispersing. He&#8217;d held them in his thrall for a time, and now it was over. Robert bowed, the smile almost real,  then he turned his back on the audience, their adulation already so much background noise.</p>
<p>The chaos that followed backstage was typical; theater folks couldn&#8217;t seem to organize themselves for longer than a two hour show. Robert had been around long enough now to see even the pattern in that, and he smiled indulgently at the flowers for the excited ingénues and the chatter of the stagehands who compared how fast the set changes had gone. Robert threaded his way past them all to the sanctuary of his dressing room—private, thank you—and took off the doublet for Costuming. He knew the drill, and Marge from Props was a right tyrant whom he had learned to avoid provoking over the years. Had he slept with her? He couldn&#8217;t remember, but she acted like a woman scorned, that was for sure. He hung up the vest and frilled shirt so that he wouldn&#8217;t have reason to face her wrath in the morning. At least, not for that infraction.</p>
<p>Robert was still wiping the greasepaint from his forehead when his door opened and the director popped in. “Nicely done, as always. A few notes, though. Mary Beth wanted me to ask you to slow down in Act two, Scene—”</p>
<p>“Mary Beth?” Robert asked. He frowned as he removed his wig. Did it always stand up in the back like that on stage? Why didn&#8217;t someone mention that he looked like an ass?</p>
<p>“Yes, Robert. Mary Beth? Gertrude?” Jim sounded exasperated. “You&#8217;re even worse this season than last about knowing the cast names. Come on.”</p>
<p>Robert shrugged and checked himself in the mirror. “Who is Gertrude to tell me about the pacing? <em>Hamlet </em>sets the pacing in that scene, not his mother. How many soliloquies does Gertrude have? Is Mary Kay&#8217;s name on the marquee? Hm?”</p>
<p>“Mary Beth.” Jim sighed. “Nice attitude, Rob.”</p>
<p>Robert pulled his eyelid up a millimeter. Was it getting droopy?</p>
<p>“Okay, then. I&#8217;ll tell her we discussed it. Thanks for being a team player.” Jim turned to go.</p>
<p>“Oh, wait,” Robert stood. “When are we assembling at The Black Arrow? Nine, as usual?”</p>
<p>“No, no. I can&#8217;t make it. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re doing that this season.” Jim shuffled his feet. “Listen, I&#8217;ve got to give the rest of the cast these notes—”</p>
<p>“Not doing it? What do you mean?” Robert frowned. “It&#8217;s tradition. We always meet there for drinks after the show.”</p>
<p>Jim rubbed the back of his neck. “Well, it isn&#8217;t the old bunch, you know? Look around, Rob. Times have changed. And people with them.”</p>
<p>“No. So we have a new Gertrude. What about Polonius? Who is it?” Robert narrowed his eyes as he tried to recall.</p>
<p>“It used to be Tom Smythe, but he moved south. Now it&#8217;s Reid. Reid McDaniels.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Well, what about Rozencrantz and Guildenstern? They&#8217;re always good for a laugh,” Robert  sighed. They were older but still mainstays in the theater community.</p>
<p>“Retired this year.” Jim put on his glasses. “They&#8217;re touring the Midwest together on vacation, I heard. I think they&#8217;re going to get married, in one of those states where it&#8217;s legal.”</p>
<p>A sickness rose in the pit of Robert&#8217;s stomach. What was happening? “Well, where <em>are </em>the old guard, then? I won&#8217;t have a drink with Laertes, you know our past. I never could stand that guy; what a preening peacock. What about Horatio? Or even Claudius, for Crissakes?”</p>
<p>“You couldn&#8217;t have a drink with Laertes now even if you wanted. He hasn&#8217;t been here in ages. Jesus, Robert. Haven&#8217;t you looked at the cast once during rehearsal? You&#8217;re the last one left. Everyone else got out of the game. In fact …” Jim wouldn&#8217;t look at him. “I didn&#8217;t want to tell you like this, but after this season, I&#8217;m out, too. The wife and I have some property in—”</p>
<p>“<em>What?</em>” Robert felt like someone had landed a sucker punch to his gut, and he was still reeling. “What the hell are you talking about? We&#8217;re young yet. Retiring? Get serious!”</p>
<p>Jim fell silent for a moment. “Robert. I&#8217;m sixty-five. I&#8217;ve been in this business for too long. I had another heart attack this year, and the doc says I can&#8217;t survive one more.”</p>
<p>“A second heart attack? When did you have the first one?” Robert thought back, but he couldn&#8217;t remember a time that Jim hadn&#8217;t been there. He had clear memories of all of his seasons onstage, and <em>someone </em>had directed him to his glory. Hadn&#8217;t it been Jim?</p>
<p>Evidently not. Jim was giving him a look, one laced with what appeared to be a mixture of pity and disgust. “Listen, I have to go. The others are waiting for me—”</p>
<p>“Wait!” Panic rose. “Do you think Ophelia would care to go for drinks?”</p>
<p>Jim shook off his restraining hand. “It&#8217;s <em>Felicity</em>, for fuck&#8217;s sake. And no. She has kids, don&#8217;t you get it? Everyone has someone else. Felicity has two kids, and she leaves right after her death scene, if you&#8217;d pay any attention. It&#8217;s over, Robert. I&#8217;ll see you tomorrow. And watch your pacing in Act two. That&#8217;s from your director, not your mother.” With that, Jim left.</p>
<p>Robert sat down heavily at his dressing table. He gazed with unseeing eyes at the newspaper clippings of his reviews through the years. He didn&#8217;t have to read them to know what they said; he&#8217;d memorized the stellar critiques of his performances and he knew that every one held him in the highest regard. Why, then, was he so empty now? Why did he feel the weight of his years upon him with nothing to show for it?</p>
<p>Robert blinked, and looked upon his hands. They were those of an older man. He saw his face in the mirror, and though he wasn&#8217;t ancient, the lines were etched more deeply than before. Soon he wouldn&#8217;t be able to play the Hamlets and the Macbeths. Soon he would be relegated to the King Lears and the Lepiduses. Could it be true? It felt too early in his career for that.</p>
<p>It seemed only yesterday that he had gotten his start as one of the nameless henchmen in <em>Richard II</em>. How he remembered his ambition; it was an unquenchable thirst that burned in his throat, that craving for more. He stood upon that stage in his drab little tunic and watched those men perform around him, really <em>live </em>those lines, and he knew that was what he could be doing, but better, if they would give him the chance. He wouldn&#8217;t wait for them to give it, he would take it.</p>
<p>And so he had. He&#8217;d taken every role along the way, played every damned Dogberry and Trinculo until he made it to the shining pinnacle, and now there was no one above him. It was <em>his </em>name they cried. It was <em>his </em>role that was the lead, each and every performance, and there was nothing better in this world, was there? To be loved by the public, to be admired by his fans.</p>
<p><em>            To be alone.</em></p>
<p>Robert shook off the thought and gathered his things to take back to his flat. It wasn&#8217;t a long walk. He had nowhere else to go. He supposed he should be grateful for the silence in his home after the shouting and vigor of the stage. He should be glad for the darkness that would greet him after the brightness of the spotlight. He could hear the rest of the cast chattering, but he slipped out the stage door exit and made his way home. Tomorrow would come soon enough, and the show would begin anew. He had to be ready for the next performance, always the next performance. That was all that mattered in this world. <em>His </em>world, which he had made, and which he still owned.</p>
<p>For now.</p>
<p><strong>Green in Judgment</strong></p>
<p>Sara picked at a notch in her fingernail until it became a jagged tear. She caught the rough edge between her teeth and pulled until the entire white lunula came free with a satisfying burn. A tell-tale metallic taste spilled onto her tongue, and she knew she&#8217;d bitten down to the quick. Dammit. Her mother was going to have a cow if she got blood on this dress. It was dry clean only.</p>
<p>As if on cue, her mother looked over and frowned. “Honey, don&#8217;t.”</p>
<p>Sara rolled her eyes and glanced around the theater, which was starting to fill up with old people. God, could it get any more boring? It was bad enough that she had to read this shit in school, and now her parents were forcing her to come and watch it onstage? Sara coughed as the cloying perfume, some sort of stale musk, wafted over from a blue-hair in the next seat. She had to be the only person under the age of fifty-five in the whole place. She hefted a sigh to make her displeasure known, in case the last three dramatic groans hadn&#8217;t cued her folks in to her state of extreme unhappiness.</p>
<p>“Did you know that this theater was built in—”</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t <em>care, </em>Dad,” Sara cut him off and narrowed her eyes, but the effect was lost under the dimness of the house lights.</p>
<p>“Well, excuse me for living. I just thought you might want to know a little something about the history of the place. It&#8217;s fascinating stuff.” Her father was perpetually cheerful. In an annoying way.</p>
<p>Sara made a point of leaning away, but not so far as to bump elbows with the old lady who was hogging the adjoining armrest. Would this thing never start?</p>
<p>“So, I says to Bernie, you get what you get when you eat like that. He should know better, what with his gout. But he can&#8217;t leave the orange juice alone, bless his poor heart &#8230;” Blue-Hair was talking to her friend, a woman with a God-awful ugly shawl.</p>
<p>“Oh. My. <em>God,” </em>Sara said under her breath and shifted away from the conversation taking place to her left, but it was too late. She&#8217;d already heard more than she cared to about gout. She shuddered. This place was crawling with ancient people. Why couldn&#8217;t she have gone to the movies with her friends? They must be having a great time, and she was totally missing it! Sara crossed her arms. She would never forget this injustice foisted upon her by her parents. She just hoped no one saw her here.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s a shame that Jim Wardenburg retired. Did you get a chance to see his <em>Hamlet</em>? Superb. I didn&#8217;t realize at the time that it was going to be his directorial swan song, and I&#8217;m so lucky to be a season ticket holder.” Blue-Hair was saying.</p>
<p>“I missed it, but I saw his <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> the year before that. He just got better every year, didn&#8217;t he? I wonder how this new director will fare? <em>Twelfth Night</em> can be tricky, and I do so hope he hasn&#8217;t done it with a heavy hand. Nothing worse than a preachy Orsino, if you ask me,” Ugly-Shawl sniffed.</p>
<p><em>            Nobody </em>did <em>ask you; don&#8217;t have a heart attack over it</em>, Sara thought. The house lights blinked, signaling the imminent beginning of the play, and not a moment too soon, in her opinion. At least the peanut gallery would quit their yapping.</p>
<p>She had read this play in Honors English, so she knew what to expect. This was going to be so lame. Sara sat back and folded her arms, prepared to suffer through a few hours of old-English nonsense.</p>
<p>“If music be the food of love, play on!”</p>
<p>Sara&#8217;s eyes were drawn of their own accord to the actor who said the lines with such joviality. He was rather handsome, actually. Maybe it wouldn&#8217;t be such a bad time after all if she had him to look at.</p>
<p>Curio spoke up. “Will you go hunt, my lord?” Even he seemed into this. Sara relaxed a little. It didn&#8217;t sound nearly as dry with this crowd of handsome young men speaking their lines so enthusiastically.</p>
<p>She watched Orsino as he spoke again. He was really very compelling; all of his lines sounded so natural. It didn&#8217;t seem like Shakespeare at all the way he said the dialogue. Sara peeked at the program. Reid McDaniels. He was only a few years older than she was! Sara was amazed. How could someone <em>her </em>age be up there onstage, acting in such a professional role? How long had he been doing this? She made a mental note to read up on his history at the intermission. Right now she wanted to pay attention.</p>
<p>This was not turning out at all the way she had expected. The actors stopped being actors after a time. They became the Duke, who was desperately in love with Lady Olivia, and Sebastian and &#8230; what a bitter love triangle, when Viola got involved as Cesario! Sara laughed and groaned, and when the foolish Sir Andrew challenged Cesario to a duel, she cringed. The foils came out, and Sara breathed a sigh of relief when no one was harmed, even though she knew the ending. To see it unfold in front of her eyes and hear the lines spoken by people who cared … she had never been so entranced. Was there ever so clever a play to have been written? This had romance, heart-break, action and feats of derring-do. Why had she never realized it before? It had taken seeing it onstage for her to realize the magic of the story.</p>
<p>When the Clown said his final words, and all was set to right at last, no one clapped louder than Sara in the whole of the audience. When Viola took her bow, Sara gave her a standing ovation.</p>
<p>“Eh. I&#8217;ve seen better,” Sara heard Blue-Hair say as they filed out. “I should have gone to the <em>Macbeth</em> instead. At least we would have been able to see Robert St. Vincent. Now <em>there&#8217;s </em>an actor, and make no mistake.”</p>
<p>“Did you like it?” Sara&#8217;s dad asked, just as she was about to fire back an indignant retort on behalf of the entire cast and crew. “I know this isn&#8217;t really your thing.”</p>
<p>Sara turned to him. “Whoever said it wasn&#8217;t? You always think you know everything, Dad. You know what, I&#8217;ve changed my mind. I think I want to be an actress someday! I don&#8217;t know why I never thought of it before. If that Reid guy can do it, well, I can, too. I&#8217;ll bet they have the most glamorous lives. Imagine everyone watching me up there! I&#8217;d never be sorry if I could do that for a living.”</p>
<p>“Um, that&#8217;s the key. For a living, right, dear? I don&#8217;t exactly see you as the type to starve for your art.” Sara&#8217;s dad laughed, and nudged her mom. They moved into the aisle with the rest of the departing crowd.</p>
<p>Sara bristled. “Why is it always about money with you? I could bring the words alive. I&#8217;d make people happy. I would never regret it. An actor&#8217;s life, now <em>that&#8217;s </em>the life for me!”</p>
<p>It was probably for the best that she didn&#8217;t see the looks on her parents&#8217; faces as she flounced up the aisle, her head full of dreams of limelight and happy endings.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I</p>
<p>Hamlet’s most enduring relationship is with the sense-making absurdist Yorick the Fool, dead 23 years. As a boy, Hamlet rode joyfully upon Yorick’s back, his young head raised heavenward. Now the wistful adult Hamlet, kneeling by Yorick’s unearthed grave, raises Yorick’s head upward, his skull in Hamlet&#8217;s hand. Yorick&#8217;s dismembered bones are small solace for the beleaguered prince, nor is there comfort for Hamlet in his remembered though wholly incorporeal murdered and usurped father, back from that bourn which Hamlet insists no one ever returns from. Hamlet and his father cross paths, and purposes, atop Elsinore’s airy ramparts where cloud meets earth. Yet, even before the ghost’s appearance, the prince is groping for solid ground, &#8220;Seems, madam! nay it is;” he declares to his mother, “I know not seems.&#8221; But Elsinore, home to ghosts, conspirators, actors, and the antically disposed, is steeped in seems.</p>
<p>Strong-armed Fortinbras knows not seems<em>.</em> The Norwegian prince takes no orders from a ghost and, as directed by a benign uncle, blunts his anger over <em>his</em> father’s death by invading a hapless Poland. Like Yorick, Fortinbras seems at first incidental to <em>Hamlet</em>—a few references at the beginning, a quick appearance and mention in the middle, a last-minute entrance at the end—but the claustrophobic, conspiratorial events transpiring inside Elsinore heighten, and play out, against the backdrop of impending doom as established first and last by the unstoppable Fortinbras. Life without and within Elsinore conspires against Hamlet, who finds no purchase in the law, social mores, friends, lover, family or, at last, God, who Himself is in danger of usurpation as the first rays of the Renaissance tinge the gloomy borders of Denmark. The broad dome of the world and its conquering Fortinbras will replicate itself beneath the dome of Elsinore and its plotting Claudius and, finally, within the distracted globe of Hamlet&#8217;s rage-filled head. There, Fortinbras’ earnest, realpolitik narrative will contend monstrously against Yorick’s theatrical, cream-pie commentary on human folly.</p>
<p>Nothing now goes on inside the stabilizing head of Yorick whose oblique sensibility is assumed briefly by Yorick&#8217;s stand-in, the madcap grave-digger (actually standing in Yorick&#8217;s grave), the only character in the play to match Hamlet wit for wit. His medieval title for a rustic, <em>clown,</em> conflates neatly with Yorick’s <em>jester</em>. He sings while knee-deep in the grave, indulges in literal gallows humor, and reunites, Lazarus-like, Hamlet with Yorick who, years before, baptized the gravedigger when he poured wine over the gravedigger’s head. Yorick’s freewheeling conviviality, his transfer of spirits—of things liquid and fluid and ungraspable—will, within the confines of Claudius’ cup, turn rank and deadly.</p>
<p>Hamlet, these long years, has cobbled together an order based on the examples of competing warlords, a superficial mother, sycophantic advisers and, finally, university books that hint at a bourn beyond the Bible&#8217;s or, at least, the Church’s. It is not happenstance that of all the universities in Europe, Shakespeare has placed Hamlet at Wittenberg where, just 47 years before the playwright-actor’s birth, Martin Luther launched his 95 missiles against the Church’s seemingly impenetrable walls and from where, a few years later, Georg Joachim Rheticus would help Copernicus drag the sun to the center of the universe. While the fictional action of the play likely takes place before the historical events at Wittenberg and before Henry VIII’s Anglican rupture, Shakespeare’s anxious post-Luther audience is, by the late 16th century, on visceral alert—for what was to stop the Son of God, recently plucked from those high, thick walls as Luther insisted, from simply wandering off altogether? Such unspoken foment undergirds the play, and Hamlet’s books, full of mathematics, philosophy, and natural history, only reinforce his native suspicion that there may be no borders at all other than what the human mind can perceive or define for itself. &#8220;There is,&#8221; says the prince, &#8220;nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.” Fortinbras defines all for himself, but his definitions, Hamlet intuits, are of an antiquated order soon to be replaced by the university and a world in which knowledge might be built upon knowledge.</p>
<p>Hamlet&#8217;s many books still weigh less than the Bible and its certainty of an afterlife.  When Polonius asks Hamlet what he is reading, Hamlet’s response, “Words, words, words,” meant to mock Polonius, is also a self-indictment of his own ultimately feckless book-learning, the university but one more flimsy human construct, laughable in a ghost-haunted world where time is out of joint. In the meantime, words remain Hamlet’s natural default and temporary stay against a silence he fears. Even upon his father’s otherworldly revelations of murder and betrayal, Hamlet seeks succor not from friend Horatio or girlfriend Ophelia (certainly not from the Church), but instead, first and foremost, demands his writing tablet—“My tables. Meet it is I set it down”—where he can commit in ink on paper, the words of a ghost, granting those words greater substance than is available to the ghost himself. As always for Hamlet, <em>word</em> is made flesh. The prince&#8217;s wry pun that the jawless skull of Yorick, is &#8220;chap fallen,&#8221; (i.e., “down in the mouth,&#8221;  i.e., &#8220;sad,&#8221;) is not merely a rumination on death, but is commentary on everyone’s impending speechlessness, including his own. Yorick’s skull, says Hamlet, “had a tongue in it and could sing once.&#8221; (Sadly, in just a few lines, Hamlet will discover that the same observation applies to the singing Ophelia). Singing, acting, performing, those brief imperfect mirrors of an imperfect world are for Hamlet the world itself. Nonplussed before the specter of a ghost from another realm (who somehow still speaks), the prince’s supposed madness inside the castle is conscious performance, supreme caricature, and grotesque impersonation of what passes for rational human intercourse in a society comprised of plotters, schemers, and betrayers. Playwrights Shakespeare and Hamlet understand—as does their Yorick—that, just as the visiting players might get at the truth through the false construct of a play, some truths are best had through storytelling, art, and artifice. A raised stage beneath Hamlet’s feet is the one steady platform by which the prince can survey the newly ordered and shifting heavens. Acting, for Hamlet, <em>is</em> action.<br />
<strong><br />
</strong>Of Hamlet’s many words, his forceful instructions to the visiting troupe of players in shaping his Mouse-trap are not only intended to elicit the truth from and indict his murderous, scheming uncle, but his words are a temporary anodyne against God’s more mysterious and oppressive Word, which nonetheless gave shape to a messy void. Nowhere else in <em>Hamlet</em> is the clever prince—now with a mission at hand—more alive, happy, and at ease: “do not saw the air too much with your hands…[b]e not too tame neither….” Sense here can be had, punishment meted out, and a just world re-established all within the perimeters of a mousetrap’s tiny dome. The actors should “neither hav[e] th’ accent of Christian…pagan, nor man,” instructs Hamlet. This trifurcation to “man” in what had clearly been a bifurcated Christian/pagan world is Hamlet’s dilemma. The actors, those who only mimic reality and pretend, should “fit word to action and action to word,” the very instructions by which an honest man comports himself in an honest world. Such a code is unavailable to Hamlet himself who must assume an antic disposition. Like Claudius, he, too, relies on subterfuge—rewriting the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern letter, rewriting the Mouse-trap play (the murderer in Hamlet’s interpolated version <em>is</em>, after all, a nephew)—but Claudius eyes a short-term future and plots while Hamlet looks to eternity and reacts.</p>
<p>The very proscription of the Mouse-trap’s dome is a refutation of that Supreme Being who is everywhere and therefore nowhere and who, consequently, makes a poor target. Hamlet, in turn, points his sword everywhere and therefore nowhere. Six of his seven victims are killed at a remove from the angry prince. His promiscuous thrashing takes down Polonius—not face to face but through a curtain. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dispatched by dispatch. Ophelia, ground between boyfriend and father (whom <em>she</em> readily obeys) commits suicide. Gertrude sips the wrong cup. Laertes tips the wrong sword. All have wronged Hamlet not just by their acts, but by their being, each an insistent reminder that the far-away university student upon attending his father’s unexpected funeral and his mother’s o’er hasty marriage to his own uncle must now turn his attentions to more pressing, baffling issues—or so says a ghost who <em>may</em> be from a Catholic Purgatory and, if not, is straight from a Protestant Hell.</p>
<p>Yet, Hamlet’s problem is not that he must identify where the ghost came from, but that a fraught universe may now serve up two after-worlds from which to choose. Hamlet’s invocation of St. Patrick, patron saint of Purgatory, after speaking with his between-worlds father, only reiterates and magnifies his own between-worlds predicament. King Hamlet’s wraithful, wrathful insistence that the living Hamlet take vengeance on Claudius and yet leave Gertrude to heaven, this self-elected winnowing of chaff from wheat, this prideful over-reaching by a probationary ghost, goes beyond simple murder and in its way hideously out-Claudiuses Claudius’s original sin. Hamlet’s description of the sky over this now corrupted earth, “a foul convergence of vapors,” is, of course, the very words that now describe his father.</p>
<p>Long severed from his kissable Yorick, an over-burdened Hamlet divests himself one by one of civics/law (Polonius), romantic love (Ophelia), familial love (Gertrude), old friendships (Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern), and tradition (Laertes)—all those props which give life definition and support but which, apparently, are no more solid than a vaporous, shape-shifting cloud, one moment a water-bearing camel, the next a water-borne whale.  As Claudius once poured a deadly potion into the ear of Hamlet&#8217;s father, Hamlet will pour a deadly potion into Claudius’ throat (throat the seat of Hamlet’s own power). At last, he’ll kill that king who, even feloniously, still rules by a residual divine right, perhaps allowing Hamlet to inch that much closer to the cloudy, shape-shifting agent of those slings and arrows lately directed against him.</p>
<p>But Claudius is an insubstantial bridge. “What,” Hamlet asks Ophelia, “should such fellows as I do, crawling between earth and heaven?” Hamlet, indeed, leaves his mother to the Old Testament God and even spares the praying Claudius who, already on his knees, might too easily crawl heavenward (or so a refraining Hamlet tells himself).  While Hamlet places his father’s murder and usurpation at the top of his grievances, the heir apparent prince is little bothered by the more obvious and personal offense of his own usurpation. Besides muddled moral qualms, his reluctance to kill Claudius is immediate and practical: if Claudius dies, Hamlet will have to assume the reign and reins of a medieval kingdom whose intrigues and responsibilities he long ago left behind. In the meantime, the merciful New Testament Jesus (who obeys <em>His</em> father and demands no retribution when returning from the dead) is nowhere to be seen along Elsinore’s airy ramparts. The unmentioned savior, like the little regarded crown, is a burden that will not be assumed. Hamlet’s ultimate dilemma is not only that he doubts the authority of, or even the existence of the Old Testament God, but that there may be no New Testament God to forgive him for doing so. By play’s end, he is bathed in blood, but not necessarily the blood of the lamb.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>Should he be or not be?  The soliloquy, a meditation on suicide, to be sure, is, at its core, more troubling. Beneath Hamlet’s contemplation of killing himself lurks the suspicion that the same unknown results could very well ensue for a dead Claudius. What is the value of either act—suicide or murder—if the fate of one’s own soul is given the same weight as a villain’s? Subsequently, how know the worth of any action large or small?  Suicide, regicide, or what to eat for lunch are all sapped of meaning. Hamlet suffers not from a failure of the will, but from a failure of the will in a life—and perhaps an afterlife—in which thought, like a ghostly father, can appear suddenly and unbidden from beyond one&#8217;s dome demanding actions whose outcomes can no longer be assured. Like Odysseus, Hamlet is clever, resourceful, and brave—as witnessed in his enthusiastic duels with the pirates and later with Laertes—but there is no Ithaca to reach for Hamlet, no faithful Penelope to lie beside, and no bed rooted in the earth on which to dream pleasant dreams.</p>
<p>By Act II, Hamlet’s earlier “seems” has coalesced into the somewhat more substantial &#8220;the play’s the <em>thing</em>.” Hamlet’s invocation of “thing” not only points to his longing for the solid, but hearkens specifically to the medieval law-giving Thing, the Scandinavian assemblies founded in part to stop revenge murders amongst Norse clans, convened to settle civil discords and levy punishments. Yet, a play, unlike a sword-fight against a pirate is, in the end, only a vivacious meditation—a sufficient mode of inquiry back at Wittenberg but inadequate inside a castle populated with conspiring kings, living and dead. Like Hamlet&#8217;s slaying of Polonius through the medium of a curtain, a play, Hamlet increasingly realizes, is only a simulacrum of real action and, while the prince is invested in the Mouse-trap’s proceedings, he is ultimately a member of an audience—and Hamlet won’t be an audience. Nor will his mind’s 20,000 ambiguities be marshaled as easily as Fortinbras’ 20,000 soldiers who, unlike Hamlet’s thoughts, move like one merely to crack an eggshell’s dome, and are willing to “go to their graves like beds” where sleep, no doubt, is untroubled.</p>
<p>While a messenger back at Elsinore is warning Claudius, that “[t]he ocean [is] overpreening,” Hamlet is undergoing a sort of sea change of his own. On Denmark’s coast, his witness of Fortinbras’ Polish invasion gives rise to the prince’s How All Occasions soliloquy – “I do not know/Why yet I live to say &#8216;This thing&#8217;s to do;&#8217;/Sith I have cause and will and strength and means/ To do&#8217;t…”—a revisiting of the perils of passivity considered in the<em> To Be</em> soliloquy. But Hamlet goes further here and, for the first time in the play, resolves to be resolute: <em>if Fortinbras can kill thousands in an exercise of will, certainly I can kill one much-deserving scoundrel…</em>. Atop that element that is sometimes a camel and sometimes a whale, that overwhelmed a living Ophelia (“drown’d, drown’d”), rotted a dead Yorick (“water is a sore decayer”), unnerved the wrought prince in Gertrude’s chamber with all its liquid sexual permutations (“sweat… enseaméd… stew’d&#8230; honeying” and a muddy “sty”), and was poured in his father’s ear, Hamlet battles the assailing pirates—and then, with equal aplomb, negotiates with those same pirates. Here, by both land and water, the divided prince weds action to word and speaks no more of flesh resolving into dew.</p>
<p>Yet, the capaciousness Hamlet feels on the broad ocean narrows as he draws closer to Elsinore—a fistfight outside the castle, a deadly duel inside its walls. Hamlet’s How All Occasions soliloquy: <em>pretended passion results in real action upon the world’s stage</em> is only his earlier What’s Hecuba To Him soliloquy turned inside out: <em>pretended action results in real passion upon a stage representing the world. </em>It is no surprise then that Hamlet, (a man reluctant to avenge his father’s death) in dueling with Laertes (a man eager to avenge his father’s death), will find the foils they fight with “all a length.”  Hamlet and Laertes (each other’s foil throughout the play) will switch foils in the heat of their duel, equally poisoning each other and, then, equally exchanging gracious pardons.  Neither Act I’s <em>seems </em>nor Act II’s<em> thing, </em>have proven themselves sufficient and Hamlet embraces what’s left to him, the more encompassing flexibility of <em>Readiness is all</em>. Upon Gertrude’s death and his own imminent death, a focused, furious, Hamlet before the seated audience of the court in the sincerest performance of his life orders, “the door be locked.&#8221; Both an Odysseus and a Telemachus now, both father and son, he at last kills the man who would lounge about his palace, marry the queen, and clutch the crown to his own perfidious head. This ready Hamlet now “drowns” Claudius and, a moment later, saves Horatio by wresting the poisoned liquid from Horatio’s grip.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>Dying, Hamlet will revert to that sphere he knows best and within 28 lines he makes ten real or metaphoric references to the act of speaking/listening: “mutes,” “tell you,” “Report me” “tell my story” “o’er-crows,” “hear the news,” “I do prophesy,” “my dying voice,” “tell him,” and, appropriately, “silence.” Yet, Prince Hamlet, now for a few remaining minutes, <em>King</em> Hamlet, asserts himself interrupting his own dying words three times to inquire about broader affairs of state: 1) “what warlike noise is this,” 2) “I cannot live to hear the news from England,” 3) “But I do prophesy th’ election lights on Fortinbras, he has my dying voice.” This last, curious gesture functions textually and extra-textually. First, Hamlet, by his vote, installs in the kingdom those stabilizing forces that allow fellows such as him to crawl between earth and heaven; the Danes, after all, have made a botch of it. Second, now that Queen Elizabeth has “uncrowned” her rival cousin Mary, Shakespeare must publicly renounce all violent means of royal devolution as witnessed in <em>Hamlet</em> and like the prince, must cast his own vote for orderly, statute-bound transfers of power. Though, despite such disavowals, Shakespeare and his audience still understand—as the gravedigger made etymologically clear amidst Yorick’s freshly unearthed bones—the only real crowner in the kingdom is the coroner.</p>
<p>Such verbal overlapping cannot be applied to parallel princes, Hamlet and Fortinbras, however.  Only after Hamlet dies, as the play draws to a close, do we at last see Fortinbras up close as if the two fatherless sons cannot occupy the same space at the same time. Taken aback by the carnage inside Elsinore, “This quarry cries of havoc,” the bloody, conquering Fortinbras in no time is tidying up rotten Denmark. “A tender prince,” Hamlet calls him in Act IV. Fortinbras alone beat a path to Hamlet’s door after Hamlet built his better mousetrap and it is Fortinbras who now honors both the action-Hamlet and actor-Hamlet. “Bear Hamlet,” he tells a captain, “like a soldier to the stage.” Hamlet, though stripped of the joy of riding high on Yorick’s back, is raised upward one last time. “Go,” says the Norwegian prince, now the newest King of Denmark, getting in the last word, “bid the soldiers shoot.” Fortinbras’ victory, ultimately a play—on words—is Yorick’s triumph.</p>
