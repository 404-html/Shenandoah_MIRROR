					<description><![CDATA[Kathleen, I just read your story for the second time and enjoyed it even more than the first time.  
You have given us so much in this view of the most publicised Lindbergh case: The hero worshipping shop girl whose relationship with her aged employee challenges her Catholic upbringing; her brother who is confined to a wheelchair; a time in this country when people were suspicious of Germans living here; a feeling that the police might be biased against Hauptmann just because he was German; Margaret&#039;s fear that Hauptmann may go free when she could actually prove he was guilt. This is heady material! 
 More! More!]]></description>
