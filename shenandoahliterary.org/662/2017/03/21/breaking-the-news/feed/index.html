					<description><![CDATA[Today, May 26, 2017, I &quot;discovered&quot; Rebecca McClanahan on The Writer&#039;s Almanac. Her poem, &quot;Watching my parents sleeping,&quot; struck me as extraordinary - one of the best poems I&#039;ve read on TWA or The New Yorker (which so often disappoints with its poetry) or anywhere.
So, I followed Ms. McClanahan&#039;s links and came upon this lovely essay, &quot;Breaking the News.&quot; She is truly a gifted writer whose soul rises above language and shed light on this reader&#039;s innermost thoughts. I will mark today as one of discovery.]]></description>
