					<description><![CDATA[Unquestionably imagine that which you stated. Your favourite 
reason seemed to be at the net the easiest factor to bear in mind of.
I say to you, I certainly get annoyed even as folks think about concerns that they plainly don&#039;t recognise about.
You managed to hit the nail upon the top and also defined out the whole thing without having side-effects 
, folks could take a signal. Will likely be again to get more.
Thanks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is an excellent poem, a poem that I read from start to finish without stopping, then read again, and once again...and will again. This poem expresses the poet&#039;s own truth...an absolute necessity for the writer. To express one&#039;s own view of one&#039;s own world is the writer&#039;s obligation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Quite wonderful, from opening to concluding stanza.   How each of us well knows, &quot;all appetite and sound.&quot;  Yet how else could we be?--and what else could he do save trade the horses: a deal he bargained for as, redemptively, he must have (I pray!) wanted the &quot;ours,&quot; the &quot;we&#039;s,&quot; or at least something anyway in that initial quid pro quo.  Alas, as the poet writes, &quot;.  .  .  we knew we had to amount/to something, to make it/worth the swap,&quot; a tit for a tat; when it&#039;s all Economics 101, capitalism, nothing but want with love removed from desire&#039;s problematic equation.  (I am reminded of Nikki Giovanni&#039;s &quot;Balances&quot;.)  Each stanza, each line, rich and full in its paring. My musings cannot do this piece justice.  A fine work.]]></description>
