								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<pre>TO LIZZY

Thanks to you I’ve become a Facebook stalker.
Every day, I Google you five or ten times
just to look for any ideas to help with
                                                getting you back.

Now I know that your newest boyfriend, Lucius —
I remember hearing him swear he’d write for
<em>Time</em> “or something bigger than that” before his
                                               thirtieth birthday —

just turned thirty-one, and he’s still reporting
hometown news, the same little rag, writing
shit about Kiwanis and geriatrics’
                                                restaurant ideas —

“Take-Out Goes Gourmet” — he’s a chump, a numbnuts!
James K. Baxter nailed it: he called newspapers
worthless, good for nothing but tablecloths and
                                                    toilet paper.

I don’t have a job with insurance, family
money, blow, or a Porsche, but if you leave him,
Lizzy, I’ll write hundreds of poems that make you
                                            come when you read them.

*

TO LUCIUS

Lucius, I know you love it now:
the sun shines, you make hay,
and I can hear her moans all night
from seven states away.

You must be a ferocious stud
to keep her entertained
for two whole months. But soon enough,
she’ll have you chained

like an old dog in a muddy yard.
Even if you can do it
ten times in a single night,
easy, she’ll hold you to it

until you can’t go on, and while
you sleep, flat-broke and drained,
she’ll sneak off to another man,
with higher grade cocaine

than yours. I never liked you slick,
spoiled types — I won’t deny it —
but call me when she does you in.
You’ll need a drink. I’ll buy it.

*

ALL THE BIG NAMES ON FACEBOOK

Sarah’s “friended” dozens of famous poets:
National Book Awards, Pulitzer Prizes,
US Laureates and McArthur Fellows —
                                             even a Nobel!

Surely she can’t have met them all in person,
even at the largest and most prestigious
writers’ conferences, which she attends yearly,
                                            summer and winter.

Yet she comments tirelessly on their timelines:
birthday wishes, kudos for their collections,
flattery for their babies, giddy tributes
                                          praising their readings:

“OMG! You cracked me up at Bread Loaf,
improvising that line about the ocean
flipping off the tourists in the Bahamas —
                                          then I was sobbing!”

God knows why they never seem to “unfriend” her;
why, instead, they “like” her transparent comments,
often as not replying with some witty
                                               self-deprecation.

Given the time she wastes fawning on Facebook,
is there any wonder her poems are puerile,
stilted, inarticulate, hackneyed, dull and
                                                hugely successful?

Just this morning, she posted an announcement:
Random House will publish her fourth collection
in as many years. Ninety-three people
                                                  “like” it already.

*

TO FRED

Out with it, Fred, you filthy dog!
Your Facebook friends are in a rage
over these oh-so-subtle hints
                                        across your page:

pics of a rose, glasses of wine,
and sunsets. Now this sly cliché —
“I’m even seeing my backyard
                                        in a new way!” —

posted the day your status changed
from “Single” to that hackneyed hedge:
“It’s complicated.” Either jump
                                       or leave the ledge!

Unless she’s married, or a beast,
or an imaginary squeeze
designed to prick another girl
                                       with jealousies,

you’d share her pics day in, day out
with no discretion (don’t forget
how hard you fell last time around:
                                      we’ve watched you sweat.)

What do you gain by clamming up?
Link to her page at least, or post
a few bikini pics that prove
                                       she’s not a ghost.

Surely you trust your Facebook pals.
If you’d just put us to the test,
I promise not even to send
                                       a friend request

without permission. Love won’t last
if it’s a secretive affair.
I want to sing of yours in verse
                                and share, share, share.</pre>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I find him huddled on the lawn,<br />
a silver tom turned stiff with frost.<br />
A portion of his skull is gone.<br />
A frozen ring of blood’s been tossed</p>
<p>in jagged fans. Now here he lies,<br />
where first November ice preserves<br />
the violence for my morning eyes.<br />
Its monument goes undisturbed.</p>
<p>I think about my brother, dead<br />
at twenty, broken window glass,<br />
his shattered spine, his ruined head<br />
spread open in the moonlit grass.</p>
<p>Sometimes a cemetery stone’s<br />
less certain than the burning markers<br />
of engine oil, grease, and bone.<br />
Those litanies make truer, darker</p>
<p>reminders of the twisted steel,<br />
the record of post-mortem harms,<br />
abrasion from the steering wheel,<br />
the abject angle of his arms.</p>
<p>Some are left as misshapen vessels<br />
mangled beyond the point of prayer<br />
when morning mist dissolves like angels<br />
and night escapes the fuel soaked air.</p>
<p>So I kneel beside the tom and tear<br />
his body from the greedy earth.<br />
The ground is hard this time of year.<br />
I’ll dig a grave for what it’s worth.</p>

<p><em>(after the photograph by Alan Kincaid)</em></p>
<p>They’re still sitting there,<br />
doing time, in the cellblock –<br />
convict-cut and canted quarry rock<br />
from the Depression – after evening chow,<br />
at the picnic table, until lights out.</p>
<p>Shutter-stilled, forty years ago,<br />
in crude monochrome,<br />
they glance up from their work:<br />
Curtis Lee, giant pick in his afro;<br />
Avon Redmond, known as Arapahoe;<br />
Shake’n’Bake; Q-Tip; Irby; Winchester;<br />
Darrell Furr, assassinated by Hell’s Angels<br />
mere weeks after parole.<br />
Long johns and Honor Grade caps,<br />
instant coffee cooked with tap water,<br />
red Bible, rusty chain-gang ashtray.</p>
<p>Smoke from their tailor-mades wreathe the light<br />
bulbs dangling from black ceiling wires.<br />
Black on the yard, but for the perimeter<br />
lamps trembling in concertina.<br />
Shadows from the dying elms<br />
splash the barred windows.</p>
<p>Night after night, they piece together with toothpicks,<br />
blue-tipped Diamond matches, popsicle sticks<br />
and Elmer’s glue, a ship – big as Noah’s Ark,<br />
into which will fit two of everything.<br />
Long ago they reckoned two of everything:<br />
those who escape time,<br />
those who take up its cross.</p>
<p>Bunks, three-tiered, circle them,<br />
guys getting their shit together for the next day:<br />
tar squad, unit and county maintenance,<br />
work and study release, chow hall, canteen.<br />
Some read; write letters. Try to sleep.<br />
Showers and shit jackets trickle. Pipes moan.</p>
<p>The Lieutenant, whistling <em>Chinatown</em>,<br />
paces the concrete block slab:<br />
long black Department Duster,<br />
like a cassock, silver badge and Meerschaum.<br />
Convicts call him <em>Creeping Jesus</em>.<br />
Sergeant Kline in the lintel of the sally port –<br />
shell-shocked from the Battle of White Horse,<br />
in Korea, never sure where, who, he is –<br />
cradles the shift clock, fixing to count them.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Father sold the horses,<br />
grumbling, <em>Fewer bellies to fill</em>.<br />
Their lives for ours, you know.<br />
We were openmouthed screeching<br />
baby birds, all appetite and sound,<br />
and we knew we had to amount<br />
to something, to make it worth<br />
the swap. We soon learned</p>
<p>our life’s lesson, that something<br />
is always being swapped<br />
for something else, bartered<br />
or exchanged: a slingshot<br />
for a sack of jacks, a kingdom<br />
for a horse, a hand<br />
on your leg under the table<br />
for a vow, the means for the end.<br />
Our father loved a deal.</p>
<p><em>What will you give me for that,</em><br />
he’d ask, a light in his menacing<br />
eye, <em>how much you want it, what<br />
you got to offer?</em> No matter how few<br />
marbles you’d saved in your small<br />
cache, he’d try to trade, all the time<br />
teaching you that nothing has value<br />
unless another wants it, that desire<br />
is all, the endless swap, getting<br />
the goods, stacking them up,<br />
pulling one out from time to time<br />
to dust it off, admire it again,<br />
or not. Maybe time to trade.</p>
<p>It’s the art of the deal, Esau’s<br />
bargain, the mess of pottage.<br />
But Father wouldn’t learn that.<br />
Over the years, he gave his life<br />
for smokes and drink, the blustery<br />
bid, the tasteless joke, the chance<br />
to be the big man in a small place,<br />
betraying his schooling, his prayers,<br />
and his prosperous children, who dared<br />
not hold out their empty hands to him,<br />
dared not entreat that bankrupt heart.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>to Jesse</p>
<p>Better a small, wild death<br />
(the doe and perhaps a trailing pair of fawns)</p>
<p>than your Ford<br />
flipped into the Hocking<br />
where Scott’s Creek meets the train yard.<br />
In this place it makes sense<br />
not to swerve<br />
when the deer leap for lodi<br />
or fields of hog corn.</p>
<p>Remember<br />
just north of Phoenix<br />
when you stopped to help<br />
the blue pickup idling on the shoulder,<br />
the man with his buck knife<br />
waiting there for anyone? It happened to be you<br />
who knelt with the doe,<br />
pulled her weight, as he coached you,<br />
into your own.  No time<br />
since hesitation breeds hope<br />
that by nightfall turns vain.</p>
<p>You say her black eyes burned into you<br />
and then went dead,<br />
two spent bulbs. You held on to them<br />
as long as reason would allow.</p>
<p>You say helping her through<br />
seemed spiritual, visceral as any remembering</p>
<p>now that you’ve felt in her dead weight<br />
the absence<br />
of expectation.<br />
What it is to stop wanting.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<pre>Taking a fancy to the woods I marry
if for no other reason than I liked his place.
Call me moonchild, triggerfish, dreamer,
or a kettle hole dolly with a big mama style.
From Bearing East to Quadrant Hill
I roam back paths, cutting through
windfall and blueberry undergrowth,
a tribe to myself, a saltwater river
with a womb full of nest eggs
                                               and a mate at sea.

Nights I lie naked telling jokes to myself
          and dream other woods, other fires --
it's all there in genetic confusion,
blood lust and Donny boys dancing.
the harp and the pipe and
                                                bats in the dark

until the sun peeps into this deciduous dizziness.

The rite of bread-making begins at first light
          and my grandma taught me how
to fill a house with the smell of yeast and wheat
                                            taking form under fire.

The last of the piping plovers
call this island home, and my babies too
will ripen here and dream themselves forth
in a furrow of their own time, a cradle
or pine needle nest: this parish of
tail walkers and ogle-eyed owls.
</pre>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A smell you can taste.</p>
<p>Road-kill, its cloud<br />
is a sudden smother</p>
<p>of summer night.<br />
<em>Pole kitty</em>, says the driver</p>
<p>to cute up<br />
the stench.</p>
<p>Just don’t frighten them<br />
you remember your father</p>
<p>saying as they<br />
meandered near the porch.</p>
<p>The two of you<br />
sat very still</p>
<p>held inside that moment<br />
by their black and white</p>
<p>elegance,<br />
their calm.</p>
<p>When they were gone<br />
he said</p>
<p>“Handsome animals really,<br />
and they only want</p>
<p>to be left alone.”</p>
<p>His starched Sunday shirt<br />
lit the dusk.</p>

and before he went</p>
<p>back to the fields,<br />
he’d catch a nap</p>
<p>there, a quick 15<br />
minutes he said</p>
<p>“percolated him.” He’s in<br />
the fields for good now</p>
<p>and in that chair,<br />
now in my living room,</p>
<p>his sleep keeps<br />
its eyes on me.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>the world I saw after he pulled me up<br />
onto the saddle  so pretty<br />
I whispered into his backbone,<br />
the taste of his sweat through the rough<br />
of his shirt,  on my tongue<br />
pretty snatches of lovesong and<br />
doe-si-do, as the laurels sprayed<br />
down on us sweet creamy<br />
petals and overhead blue china<br />
saucers on which the clouds<br />
floated. Clotted cream, I would</p>
<p>serve wedding guests such<br />
a fine sweetness they’d never again<br />
doubt my true love. Nor ever again<br />
caution rectitude.  I’d cast my bouquet<br />
so far not a girl in the county<br />
could catch it. Such a fine day<br />
as higher we climbed<br />
the leaves churning with wind</p>
<p>while into his back I breathe<br />
<em>When</em>.  And he answers soon,<br />
oh soon, as we sink into swirling<br />
shade, pink ladyslippers strewn<br />
over the banks, and fairy wands<br />
trailside  when suddenly, witch-hobble<br />
snaring my skirt, he turns to me,<br />
pulling the combs from my hair,<br />
ripping my pearl buttoned blouse<br />
to my waist, his tongue on my<br />
neck, forcing my mouth open wide,<br />
my stays ripping apart,<br />
soon, oh soon I hear him<br />
moaning, even as over my face<br />
I feel  dirt falling, hear the trot of his horse<br />
leaving as I keep trying to call out to him<br />
cupping my heartsblood,<br />
<em>Take it,</em><br />
<em> take it,</em><br />
this love that lies<br />
bleeding into my hands.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Such a story she told me,<br />
already beyond the listening age,<br />
ready to walk by myself to the river<br />
and dream I was a rainbow trout</p>
<p>rippling.&nbsp; Ripplefish, I call them.<br />
ridding the depths of all danger,<br />
for how could such shimmering signify<br />
threat to me, a girl whose hair shimmered</p>
<p>as keenly as scales catching light,<br />
so my kin told me, stroking my rivulets.<br />
Silky, so silky they murmured.<br />
She told me the river sought seawater,</p>
<p>briny as&nbsp; juice I drank from the kraut vessel.<br />
I listened hard to the shell by her bed,<br />
deep inside it the call of the ocean,<br />
she told me, though I suspect mere</p>
<p>emptiness lives at the heart of it.<br />
Inside such emptiness creatures unheard<br />
of lived, men-fish and women-fish<br />
she said, but none could live here</p>
<p>in these valleys.&nbsp; No river could hold them.<br />
They&nbsp; needed the seabed on which to sleep,<br />
the white surf to ride upon, seeking<br />
the land where a merman could sing such</p>
<p>a lovesong as no woman<br />
ever could turn from,&nbsp; nor from his<br />
body that glimmered, his muscles<br />
rippling like the trout in our rivers.</p>
<p>Only the comeliest woman would he choose<br />
to bed, her glimmering hair in his hands<br />
every night, her warm flesh against<br />
his cold.&nbsp; How they entwined I longed</p>
<p>to imagine, how easily they swam between<br />
sheets, she breathing into his salty neck<br />
words he had no need to understand,<br />
his silence the vessel in which they swam.</p>
