								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In her Autumn House Poetry Prize-winning book, <em>Apocalypse Mix</em>, Jane Satterfield presents a bracing and resigned account of the human condition by confronting the contradictions of living in a circumstance of perpetual hostility. Stylistic and thematic commonalities unify the volume, but each of its five sections hums with its own distinctive vibration, its own unabashedly pessimistic take on life in times and places shaped by conflict or, as Satterfield puts it, “apocalypse and empire.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the book’s most accomplished poems, “Why I Don’t Write Nature Poems,” appears near the end of the final section. In this prose poem, the form of which supports the avowed intent of the poem’s title, the speaker declares that she doesn’t “see a cow meadow as any kind of invocation. Am drawn to the satellite dish disrupting the view.” Readers will experience this focus on disruption throughout the volume; however, Satterfield adds nuance everywhere. In cataloguing reasons she concentrates on the human predicament and not “nature” as traditionally described, she actually writes a fine and unconventional nature poem. The poem ends, surprisingly and humorously, with the “trilling” of a cicada. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Particularly in the book’s first section, Satterfield juxtaposes pop culture and other allusions with larger themes of war and memory. The effect, which both orients and jars the reader, is likely to be felt most strongly by readers familiar with the numerous cultural references, particularly references to the music of The Clash (“Radio Clash”), Joy Division (“An Ideal for Living”), and The Rolling Stones (“Salt”), but the notes and epigraph sources in the back of the volume, along with a click or two of the mouse, make these poems easily accessible to readers of other vintages. And the book’s critique is not limited to war. Although nearly every poem has a war reference and many name particular conflicts or identifiable episodes of terror, these poems also critique the poet’s—and by extension the reader’s—complicity in the materialism that underlies conflict. Poems in the first section place the speaker in a Whole Foods aisle, a Yoga class, an Old Navy store, and a movie theatre as war is considered and recollected. “Special Screening,” a poem describing the downing of the helicopter in Mogadishu and the movie “Black Hawk Down,” is particularly interesting as it incorporates concepts and language associated closely with Donald Rumsfeld (“unknown unknowns”) and Noam Chomsky (“manufacturing consent”).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A single poem, “Bestiary for a Centenary,” composes the volume’s second major division, and its seven numbered sections mark the most emotionally engaging portion of the book. It’s not that these poems—or sections of a single poem—are markedly more lyrical than other poems in <em>Apocalypse Mix</em>. In fact, many of these lines are distinguished by diction and rhythm characteristic of prose, and that appears to be Satterfield’s point. Similar to the way she wrote a nature poem disguised as an anti-nature poem, the poet in “Bestiary for a Centenary” emphasizes the ugliness of war not directly but by describing how innocents in that conflict were used and viewed as commodities. The poem considers the roles of animals in the Great War: carrier pigeons, mules, horses, dogs. In plain diction—no figurative language could make the lines more horrifying—Satterfield writes in the second section of dogs “[g]as-masked, / outrunning sniper bullets . . . / . . . relaying / news through code notes / tucked in collars.” Each section of the poem contains similarly disturbing images. Although the poet’s care with imagery is on full display in this poem, as is her gift for lyric insight (“mortars’ unspeakable rain”), Satterfield’s point is larger than the portrayal of individual indignities. Readers will want to see the animals as heroic, but Satterfield makes sure the reader understands that heroism requires volition. These animals are not heroes; they’re slaves. The underlying question Satterfield raises is whether the soldiers are, too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Readers unfamiliar with Satterfield’s poems will find <em>Apocalypse Mix</em> both accessible and challenging. It is not a perfect book. One wishes the editorial effort had been stronger and thereby avoided a couple of distractions, e.g. the use of “sunk” as the past tense for “sink” in “Parachute Wedding Dress” and the incorrect ordering of notes for two poems in the third section. But these are momentary and isolated distractions; they do not reflect the poet’s close attention to craft reflected throughout this volume. <em>Apocalypse Mix</em> is an ambitious book, and readers who accept its challenges will be rewarded amply. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mystery and Revelation: A Review of<em> The Second Mrs. Hockaday</em> by Susan Rivers</p>
<p>by Laurel Myers</p>
<p>A compelling mix of mystery, romance, and historical fiction, <em>The Second Mrs. Hockaday</em> is an enigmatic guide on a harrowing journey through a southern homestead enveloped by the Civil War. Characters&#8217; voices chime in through letters, expertly and deftly answering the disturbing question at the center of Susan Rivers&#8217; debut novel: Did Placidia murder the child she gave birth to while her husband was away fighting for two years? While this query propels the plot, explorations of gender roles, transitioning identities, and intergenerational connections develop a multi-dimensional story, emphasizing the strength and perseverance of women during war time. As each letter is delivered, the novel carefully uncovers the stunning revelation while simultaneously developing a powerful portrait of Dia that endures the passing of time.</p>
<p>A story set during the Civil War, gender rules the narrative. Rivers exposes and explores gender roles, showing how women, specifically Placidia, must adapt in order to survive. She is only a teenage girl when she marries Major Griffth Hockaday, who is on leave from service, and while she does not fit into the mold of a prim and proper lady, able to ride the unruly horses and not minding a little bit of dirt on her face, she is well aware of the expectations of a wife and wishes to meet them. She is caught unawares by the sudden responsibilities that come with being a wife to a widower in the army. Overnight, Dia becomes a mother to a small son and the overseer of a three-hundred-acre farm. Here, she learns to rely on the slaves who have worked the land for years while still maintaining the position as a superior. The letters exchanged between Dia and her cousin Millie capture this transition from plantation lady to hardened woman while the mystery behind the conception and death of her baby comes to the forefront.</p>
<p>Rivers manages to tease out details about the overarching question from Dia’s preserved voice through diary entries found after her death. Her son Achilles reads about his mother’s hardships while maintaining the farm, caring for her child, and experiencing violence caused by the effects of war. Finally, the details of the fateful night around which the novel circles are revealed. From the diary written on the back of pictures in a Dickens novel, the knowledge of Dia’s thoughts and reactions creates a sense of intimacy that does not appear in the letters. The connection between generations, between mother and son, demonstrates the shifts in perceptions that children often have; that is to say, idealization giving way to the moment in which parents become humans who make mistakes, worry, and struggle. Ultimately, the diary entries cause Achilles to dedicate himself to finding out what exactly happened to his mother during those two years of isolation.</p>
<p>While Dia’s character rightly dominates the novel, the inclusion of many of the secondary characters seems to be haphazard and can be somewhat confusing for readers going back and forth between letters to and from different people, official documents, and the diary entries. Though reflective of the South Carolina location and era, the supporting characters lack truly distinctive voices that would crystalize their personalities and importance, adding to the disorientation. Introducing the main conflict at the beginning creates mystery and evokes intrigue, compelling eyes to read faster and hands to turn the pages quicker, but the second part lacks enough tantalizing details about the mystery that the big picture sometimes blurs, becoming lost in the preoccupations of the son. Nevertheless, River’s novel is masterfully engaging, provoking the reader to jump to conclusions concerning the dead baby’s paternity from a detail as subtle as a glance or a kind word or any implication of tenderness. She diverts attention and seems to be suggesting one solution or another until the answer to the big question arrives as a  surprise in a breathless, consuming moment.</p>
<p><em>The Second Mrs. Hockaday</em> is not simply a Civil War narrative, a mystery, a romance, nor a coming of age novel. Just as Dia transitions between roles and identities, so do the genres. The epistolary form is the perfect structure to create a captivating amalgamation of triumph, heartbreak, and the will to endure. In and of herself, Dia is a complex character who evokes both empathy and criticism, which is a captivating combination. Rivers, a skillful raconteur, handles the entanglements of Dia’s story gracefully while delving into an important occurrence in American history.</p>
