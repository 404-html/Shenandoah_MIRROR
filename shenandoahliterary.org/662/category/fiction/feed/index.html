								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>February, 1935</p>
<p>Margaret moved through the darkness with her arms outstretched as if she was going to wrestle a bear. She couldn’t see the icy patches, but she knew they were there. By the time she got to the end of the block and up her own front steps her legs were shaking. When the storm door slammed behind her she pressed her head against the second door. As cold as it was, sweat gathered under her arms. She whispered three Hail Marys before passing through the second door. She stood by the newel post and listened to the clanking radiators.</p>
<p>Her mother rented rooms to family men whose wives and children had been sent to relatives in order to cut expenses. After tiptoeing to the dining room and checking that the table was set for tomorrow’s breakfast, she leaned against the wall and closed her eyes. She imagined a truck tire was stuck in her chest and the only way to deflate it was to keep blowing out tiny puffs of air. When cool gust brushed her face she opened her eyes and saw her brother slouched in his wheelchair, a blanket over his shoulders.</p>
<p>“James,” she said.</p>
<p>“I waited up for you.” At twenty-two, James was only eleven months younger than Margaret but looked like an old man. He’d lost the use of his legs after a fall from a scaffold, and sometimes he nodded off into space when she talked to him.</p>
<p>“Are you hungry, James? I could scramble some eggs.”</p>
<p>“No, I ate. Where’ve you been?”</p>
<p>“The novena. I’m storming the heavens just like Sister Mary Michael told us to do.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, don’t forget she was big on prayers of thanksgiving too. What are you storming for?”</p>
<p>“I can’t say. It’s a secret intention.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you the mysterious one. Will you be storming on Wednesday?”</p>
<p>She shrugged. Most Wednesdays, after the store closed, she went to the sixth floor dressing room and tried on dresses while old Mr. Rothenberg watched from his perch on the love seat.</p>
<p>James wheeled to the kitchen. “Very mysterious.”</p>
<p>Margaret wished she’d told her brother what she knew about the kidnapping back in September when Hauptmann’s picture was in all the papers. But she hadn’t told James, or anyone else for that matter, because if she told what she knew she’d have to tell how she knew it, and if she told how she knew it, people would learn about her road trip with old Mr. Rothenberg. Besides &#8211; and this was the most important reason for keeping quiet &#8211; when she learned about Hauptmann’s arrest she was absolutely certain the Lindburghs’ butler would come forward and give the police the information she had. After all, the butler knew what she knew, and there was no reason on earth why he couldn’t step forward and tell the authorities about Hauptmann.</p>
<p>But then, right after the trial began, Margaret read that the butler had died. There it was in the newspaper &#8211; a tiny mention &#8211; not even a big story &#8211; that the Lindberghs’ former butler had died the previous year. Mr. Whatley, who’d been with the Lindberghs in their new house on the night little Charlie was kidnapped, had died from heart disease.</p>
<p>“A secret intention?” James was in front of the icebox holding a plate with a slice of custard pie on it. “I’m curious.” He lifted the slice in one hand while holding the plate under his chin with the other.</p>
<p>Margaret sank onto a kitchen chair. “Don’t be so curious. Just tell me if you heard anything new about the trial.”</p>
<p>“One of Lindbergh’s neighbors said Hauptmann’s car was in the area, but he didn’t know what he was talking about, and no one believed him.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“The papers said he didn’t sound like a reliable witness.”</p>
<p>“They didn’t believe him?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Mr. Flaherty was talking about something he read&#8230;about how maybe some of the evidence was trumped up.”</p>
<p>“Trumped up?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Like those boards they found in Hauptmann’s attic and how they were supposed to match the ladder left at the Lindbergh’ house &#8211; only the police didn’t find the boards right away.”</p>
<p>“James, they found the ransom money in Hauptmann’s garage!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but the police could have planted that too. Maybe they’re railroading him.”</p>
<p>“Is that what you think?”</p>
<p>“The cops aren’t always on the up and up, Margaret.”</p>
<p>“Do you think he might get off?” Her voice was scratchy as steel wool.</p>
<p>“He could, I guess. What’s the matter, Margaret? Are you all right?”</p>
<p>After James wheeled himself to his cot in the back hall, Margaret crept into the small first floor room across from her mother’s. She put on a nightgown, socks, and a hat, but even with the cap low on her brow, her nose began to drip. When her head touched the pillow, the tire in her chest became a barrel and the roof of her mouth began thumping. She sat up and pulled the comforter off the bed. Her feet were sweating through her socks, and her toes were growing numb. She grabbed two mattress pads from the closet shelf and rolled them into cushions, then wedged the cushions behind her back and dropped her head against the cold wall.</p>
<p>Since Hauptmann’s arrest she’d been falling apart. First, it was shortness of breath, then it was sweating and a dizzy feeling when she moved fast or looked down from a height. At work her knees had buckled when she looked through an upstairs window. And yesterday, on her way to the lavatory, her legs gave out and she had to crawl to the restroom and pull herself up on the doorknob. There was another feeling too &#8211; a worse one &#8211; that happened when she was alone in a room and sensed someone else was there. When she felt the invisible person was creeping toward her, her mouth turned dry and her head began to pound.</p>
<p>Margaret kept telling herself there was more than enough evidence to convict Bruno Hauptmann of the kidnapping. In addition to the marked ransom money in his garage, there was the board in his attic that matched the boards in the ladder the kidnapper left in the Lindberghs’ yard. There was the hand-writing expert who said Hauptmann’s writing matched the ransom notes, and there was the phone number that was penciled onto Hauptmann’s pantry wall that tied him to the man who’d handed over the ransom money in the graveyard.</p>
<p>Still, it seemed that no matter what happened in the courtroom, people believed the police were going after Hauptmann because he was German. Alma Mueller, the bookkeeper at Rothenberg’s, and the Hermans across the street were convinced that the Lindberghs’ nursemaid was guilty. Others insisted there was no evidence to show Hauptmann was in any way connected with the Lindbergh’s new house. These doubters asked how Hauptmann, a man from the Bronx, would even know where the Lindberghs’ house was, or if he did know, how he’d know where the baby’s room was.</p>
<p>“How is it,” Margaret asked herself a hundred times a day, “that I’m the only person in the world who can prove Hauptmann is guilty?”</p>
<p>On Wednesday evening, Margaret stared through the dressing room curtains to where Mr. Rothenberg sat on the striped love seat with his legs crossed at the ankles. She slipped out of her dress, took the first dress off its hanger and stepped into it. When she turned to the old man he smiled at her and his bald head glistened in the light from the urn-shaped lamp. Tiny gold fans had been painted onto the pink lamp. Other fans were on the wallpaper. There were fans and rosebuds on the fabric that hung in big bunches from the curtain rods above the dressing room doorways.</p>
<p>The puffy love seat was flanked by four gilded chairs that were arranged in a semi-circle in the sitting area. The floor was covered in pink carpeting and a strip of carpet ran beside the individual dressing rooms. A floor-to-ceiling mirror, draped with a pink satin swag, stood at the end of the hallway.</p>
<p>“Mr. Rothenberg,” she said. Her mouth was dry but her voice came out louder than she intended. “Do you remember the day we went on that trip to the Lindberghs’ house over in Hopewell?” She felt strange asking the question because in the three years since they’d taken the trip, neither of them had ever mentioned it. There were other things they didn’t mention &#8211; things Margaret was too embarrassed to mention.</p>
<p>“A trip, my dear?” The old man’s smile widened as he made a circle with his finger to tell her to turn around and show him the back of the dress.</p>
<p>“Don’t you remember? Milton drove us. It was cold and rainy and we ate in Flemington.”</p>
<p>“I especially like that emerald one,” he said, lifting a freckled hand to the chiffon gown which had enough fabric to cover three love seats.</p>
<p>“Don’t you remember?” Margaret’s hands were icicles. “We had lunch at that cabbage place, and you looked at some property.”</p>
<p>Mr. Rothenberg smiled even wider before tilting his head to one side. “Lovely, lovely, my dear.” He brushed his trouser knees with his palms before folding his hands and staring at her with the sweetness of a baby.</p>
<p>“You don’t remember?”</p>
<p>“Such a pretty girl and that lovely hair. You can pin it up when you try on the blue gown.”</p>
<p>“You don’t remember?” she said again.</p>
<p>A frown crossed the old man’s forehead but in an instant it was gone, and then, though it didn’t seem possible, his smile grew even sweeter.</p>
<p>“It’s all right, Mr. Rothenberg.” Margaret had never done anything really wrong with Mr. Rothenberg. She hadn’t done anything she felt she needed to confess to Father Byrnne. Really, all she ever did was take off her clothes and put on the dresses he brought to the dressing room. She’d turn, walk to the big mirror, shift her weight from leg to leg and walk back. The old man only touched her when he gave her an envelope. Then he’d rub her arm and brush her breasts before patting her hand with a steady little pat that made her feel she couldn’t pull away.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>On the day Margaret and Mr. Rothenberg went to Hunterdon County she’d waited under an awning on the corner of Wister and Goodman Streets. When the shiny black Cadillac pulled up to the curb, the driver got out and opened the door.</p>
<p>She’d thought they were going to New York to see the spring dresses, but Mr. Rothenberg told the driver to go west to Flemington. “I want to look at some property my wife’s brother told me about,” he said. “And there’s a good little restaurant out that way that’s known for its cabbage soup.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” Margaret said. Of course she knew Mr. Rothenberg was married but he’d never mentioned his wife before.</p>
<p>“We’ll be back by late afternoon, isn’t that right, Milton?”</p>
<p>Margaret sank into the backseat and crazily thought about Lewis and Clark heading west to explore new territory. She pictured herself draped in animal skins and standing on a flatboat while Milton pushed a pole along the river bottom.</p>
<p>For most of the trip Margaret looked at the fashion drawings the old man took from a wide black folder. When they arrived on the outskirts of Flemington Mr. Rothenberg read out the directions that were written on the back of an envelope. Ten minutes later they came to a lone brick building on a ten acre site dotted with “For Sale” signs. Mr. Rothenberg and Milton got out of the car and went into the building while Margaret stayed in the car. When the men returned, there was a moment of quiet before Milton turned on the engine. Five minutes later they were at the Sugar Maple Inn, in a fieldstone cottage on a street that ended in a large empty lot. A picture of a red cabbage was painted on a yellow board that stood just inside a picket fence. There was another cabbage painted on the door. When the door was opened, the smell of apples, cinnamon, bacon and cabbage wafted out to meet them.</p>
<p>After the soup, Margaret ate roasted chicken, spiced apples and pecan pie. She drank two cups of tea and visited the tiny powder room which was the same pink as the dressing room at Rothenbergs. Even so, she was glad when Milton stopped for gas ten minutes after winding through Hopewell.</p>
<p>A stoop-shouldered man wearing a cap with ear-flaps was pumping gas into the car when she found the facilities at the back of the gas station. After leaving the restroom, she stood under a narrow roof and tilted her head up to the drizzle. “Good weather for ducks,” a young boy said. He wore overalls on top of a gray sweater. With his freckles and long bangs he looked just like James did when he was ten.</p>
<p>“You want it to snow?” she asked.</p>
<p>“No customers when it snows.”</p>
<p>“I hadn’t thought of that.”</p>
<p>“That’s my dad.” The boy pointed to the stooped man in the cap. “That’s my house.” A stone house with a red door stood across from the gas station. It reminded Margaret of a picture in her old nursery rhyme book and for an instant she expected Old Mother Hubbard to bounce through the door wearing a big white pillow on her head.</p>
<p>“You ain’t from around here, are you?” the boy asked.</p>
<p>“I’m from Newark.”</p>
<p>“I knew you weren’t from here.”</p>
<p>“You know everybody who lives here?”</p>
<p>“Just about &#8211; all the ones with cars anyway. Course we get new folks every now and then.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy walked alongside Margaret and when she got back into the car he leaned inside and kept talking. “Guess you could say we got the most famous folks in the whole world come to settle right here in Hopewell.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Margaret said.</p>
<p>“Who are they, young fellow?” Mr. Rothenberg asked.</p>
<p>“Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh and Mrs. Anne Morrow Lindbergh.” The boy spoke as if he was making an announcement. “You don’t think that’s famous?”</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s famous all right,” the old man said. “That’s famous.”</p>
<p>“They’re just after building a big stone house down that road over there. When it’s done, they’re gonna put in an airfield.”</p>
<p>“An airfield?” Margaret said.</p>
<p>“Yes, Mam. They bought up thirteen farms &#8211; got near 400 acres.”</p>
<p>“My goodness.”</p>
<p>“The stone boulders in that house are over 28 inches thick. My Uncle Roscoe was one of the carpenters and he says you ain’t gonna see the likes of it for a long while. They got a three-car garage too. They got chauffeurs stop in here more than once when the Lindberghs come to see how it’s coming. They’re fixing to move in soon. The butler is there already.”</p>
<p>Milton had settled back into his seat and the boy’s father had gone back to the gas station, but the boy kept talking. “That butler don’t mind giving folks tours neither. You can just drive right up and he’ll show you around. My mom done it.”</p>
<p>“You say people visit the Lindberghs’ house?” Milton asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. You take that road over there.” The boy pointed to the road beside the red-doored cottage. “It ain’t but two miles. Turn right when you see the stone posts and keep going up the driveway. You go to the side door and the butler will take you around. My uncle says he likes to show it off.”</p>
<p>After Milton turned on the motor and began to drive away, Margaret waved to the boy. &nbsp;When Mr. Rothenberg told Milton to turn at the red-doored house, she looked out the window and saw the boy still waving. Minutes later, at the end of the Lindberghs’ driveway, Milton gave a whistle and stopped the Cadillac. The white-washed stone house was on the left. On the right, was the still-unfinished garage. Piles of bricks sat on wooden pallets in the mud.</p>
<p>When Milton opened the door and held out an umbrella, Mr. Rothenberg told Margaret she should go by herself. “You go see the house while Milton and I take a little stroll on that path over there.”</p>
<p>“A stroll?” The air was even gloomier than at the gas station and the drizzle was getting heavier.</p>
<p>“I’ve got a little indigestion and I feel like taking some air. You go and have the tour.&nbsp; Milton, you ready?”</p>
<p>Margaret watched as the men walked to the small woods where pine needles had been spread out to make a path. She went around to the other side of the garage and stared at the house while the wind blew her coat against her legs. A squirrel darted in front of her, but instead of heading to the house, she turned to the wide expanse of land that fanned out from a downward slope. It was probably where the airfield would go. She’d never been on an airplane, or seen one close-up, but she knew if she ever got onto one she’d need a leather cap with a chin strap.</p>
<p>Her hair was a windmill by the time a man yoo-hooed to her from the house. A moment later, holding her hair and running as best she could, she arrived at the side door.</p>
<p>“You came to see the place?” The man was heavy-set and spoke with an English accent.</p>
<p>“The boy at the gas station&#8230;.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. I’m just doing a bit of settling in. I’d be glad to show you around.”</p>
<p>“That’s very kind.”</p>
<p>“My wife is in Englewood packing up some linens. I’m Oliver Whatley.” the man said.</p>
<p>“I’m Margaret Dooley,” Margaret said. “The boy said the Lindberghs will be moving in soon.”</p>
<p>“That’s right.” The butler nodded to her feet, then to a small gray rug. Without any further sign, she slipped off her shoes and followed Mr. Whatley into the large kitchen which held an enormous wooden work table in its center.</p>
<p>“This is grand,” she said. She’d never used the word “grand” before, and she wondered why she was talking like her mother.</p>
<p>Mr. Whatley tilted his head at the six sets of candlesticks and the twelve tiny salt cellars that sat next to a cloth-covered notebook. Sixteen napkins rings sat on the counter beside her and an open jar of polish was giving off a mothball smell.</p>
<p>“There’s still a lot of work.”</p>
<p>Just then Margaret heard a knock. “Another visitor,” Mr. Whatley said, going to the side door. Margaret stood stiffly, aware of being alone in a place she had no business being. She was afraid that when Mr. Whatley returned he’d accuse her of taking something. Worse still, she had a strong urge to put a silver napkin ring into her pocket.</p>
<p>She heard a guttural mumbling and when Mr. Whatley returned to the kitchen he was accompanied by a thin man wearing a brown suit and carrying a hat. “Here’s another visitor,” Mr. Whatley said. “This is Miss Dooley, and Miss Dooley this is&#8230;.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Schmidt,” the man said in a heavy German accent. He bent down to untie his shoes. After he picked them up he turned to the hall and returned without them.</p>
<p>The butler led them through a large pantry lined with glass-doored cabinets. Inside the cabinets were rows of wine and parfait glasses. Other cabinets held plates, bowls, cups and saucers. An entire cabinet was filled with platters, and another with soup tureens and gravy boats.</p>
<p>“My wife and I have been working on the kitchen and pantries all week,” the butler said, “but there’s still a great deal to be done in the rest of the house.”</p>
<p>In the dining room a mahogany table was pushed away from a chandelier that hung from the fifteen foot ceiling. Boxes stood three deep around the perimeter of the room and waist-high andirons guarded either side of the fireplace.</p>
<p>Rolled-up rugs rested against the walls in the center hallway and more boxes sat on both sides of the wide front door. A moment later, when Mr. Whatley opened the double doors to the living room Margaret gasped. She’d never seen anything so beautiful. She wanted the blue silk curtains and the polished floor. She wanted the window seat, the grand piano, the fireplace with its hand-carved woodwork. She wanted the dark table that held a pair of Chinese vases and the short chestnut table that stood on ballet slipper feet. She wanted the silver-framed photos of the baby who’d been born a year and a half earlier.</p>
<p>Margaret pulled in her breath and lowered her eyes. Mr. Whatley stood with his fingers laced in front of him. “I’m partial to this room myself,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Schmidt combed back his hair with his fingers so Margaret could see his wide forehead and deep-set eyes. He swept his eyes around the room as if looking for something and when Mr. Whatley led them to Colonel Lindbergh’s study it seemed that Mr. Schmidt had found it. He stood with a pleased expression, nodding at Lindbergh’s desk.</p>
<p>“As you see, there are still plenty of boxes to unpack,” the butler said with a glance to the bookshelves. He stood by the study door so they wouldn’t linger, then made a small clicking noise with his tongue so they’d follow him up the stairs. “I’m not able to show you all the rooms, but I know you want to see the nursery.”</p>
<p>The butler went first, followed by Mr. Schmidt. Margaret had never seen a four poster crib before. To the left of the crib was a small table and chairs and a screen painted with farm animals. Margaret pressed the inside of her cheeks against her teeth and thought about the babies left in train stations and on doorsteps. Last week, a three- year-old girl with crusty eyelids, had been left in the foyer of Rothenberg’s. She’d had a note pinned to her coat asking someone to take care of her.</p>
<p>Mr. Schmidt stood by the window to the left before moving to the window closer to the crib. He ran his hand along the inside of the shutter. “Goot work,” he said, turning to the butler.</p>
<p>“One of these shutters isn’t right,” Mr. Whatley said, nodding to the corner. “I think it’s warped. We need to get the carpenters back to fix it.”</p>
<p>Mr. Schmidt went to the corner window and closed the shutter. Then he opened it. “Maybe rehang,” he said, sliding his hand under the shutter and looking out the window.</p>
<p>Margaret could tell Mr. Whatley was trying to hurry them along but she wanted to linger, and she could tell Mr. Schmidt did too. He was holding back, running his eyes around the room as if he couldn’t bear to leave. In the upstairs sitting room, Margaret watched Mr. Schmidt run his hands over the shelves and when they moved down the hallway he stopped to open and close the doors. “Goot. The work is goot.”</p>
<p>“You must be a carpenter, ” Mr. Whatley said.</p>
<p>“I don’t say yes or no,” Mr. Schmidt answered. His response made Margaret smile, but when she turned to look at him he looked away.</p>
<p>They were taken to the servants’wing, and finally back to the kitchen where their shoes waited on the gray rug. “Thank you so much,” Margaret said half a dozen times. Mr. Schmidt, who seemed more foreign now that the tour was over, brought his heels together and bowed to Mr. Whatley.</p>
<p>“When will the Lindberghs move into the house?” Mr. Schmidt asked.</p>
<p>“Soon. In the next week or so, I would say.”</p>
<p>The rain was steady and the air was colder than before. Margaret pulled her coat tight around her shoulders and was about to run to the Cadillac when Mr. Schmidt touched her elbow. “You don’t have car?” he asked.</p>
<p>“It’s behind the garage,” she said, pointing.</p>
<p>“These rich,” he said. “They live in big house. They have big car and airplane. Why is this Lindbergh big man? He is only one to fly airplane? I want to fly airplane.”</p>
<p>Margaret didn’t know what to say. Like every girl in America, she’d been in love with the Lone Eagle when he flew across the Atlantic. Before Lindy married Anne Morrow, Margaret used to dream he’d come into Rothenberg’s and ask for help in finding a dress for his mother. As they looked at the ball gowns in the special showroom, Lindbergh would fall in love with her and they’d get married.</p>
<p>“You think this Lindbergh is big man because he can do what anybody can do? You think he’s better than me?”</p>
<p>All Margaret could think was how Mr. Rothenberg and Milton were waiting. She took a breath and brought her heels together the way Mr. Schmidt had done minutes before. “I don’t know,” she said. “I don’t know you.”</p>
<p>Mr. Schmidt pulled his lips into a sneer.</p>
<p>Margaret trotted over to the flat stones and when she got to the area sprinkled with gravel, she stopped. A blue Dodge with New York license plates was sitting at the edge of the gravel. She thought how Mr. Schmidt had come all the way from New York to see the Lindberghs’ house, and now he was complaining about it.</p>
<p>She tried not to make an imprint in the mud, and when she saw the Cadillac, she didn’t rush. When Milton got out of the car and waved to her, she turned to take one final look. Mr. Schmidt had walked around to the front of the mansion and was looking up at the windows.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>It was an hour before midnight and Margaret knew this would be her third night without sleep. Her neck was stiff when she put her pillow against the rolled up mattress pads. She tried counting her breaths and saying the “Hail Holy Queen,” but nothing helped. She got out of bed and wandered around the first floor, stopping in the dining room. She sat at the table and folded her hands the way the nuns had taught her, but a moment later sweat pooled under her arms and trickled down her sides. Something was lurking in the room. She squeezed her lips together but they wouldn’t stop quivering. A moment later her whole body was shaking. Her toes were frozen but she was too frightened to bend over and rub them.</p>
<p>“Charlie,” she whispered as a picture of Little Charles Lindbergh &#8211; the Little Eaglet &#8211; &nbsp;came to her. He was supposed to have a perfect life. After all, he had perfect parents and a perfect house. He had nursemaids, gardens, and a hill to roll down. He had a little table and a screen painted with happy animals. Half a dozen pictures of Charlie had been in the newspapers, but the one that always came to her was the one taken on his first birthday. It showed a curly-haired boy sitting in a small wooden chair. His chubby face was turned away from a birthday cake with one lone candle. The little boy was looking at the shiny new bucket that hung from the chair arm.</p>
<p>The click of a floorboard exploded in her head. Whoever was creeping up behind her was getting closer but no matter where they were she couldn’t loosen the grip her hands had on each other. Slowly, she turned her head and heard a crunching noise that sounded as if someone was walking on sand. She forced herself to turn her head even farther and when she didn’t see anyone behind her, she took a breath and pushed up from the table.</p>
<p>In the kitchen, she drank a glass of water before going to the parlor and kneeling beside the radio. Static flew into the room and a moment later sounds of pandemonium broke through.</p>
<p>“Seven thousand people are here at the Hunterdon County Courthouse!” the announcer shouted over what sounded like the roar of the ocean. “Guilty!” he shouted. “Bruno Richard Hauptmann has been found guilty and sentenced to death!”</p>
<p>Margaret fell back and wrapped her arms around her knees. “Guilty!” the announcer yelled through the speaker. “After a thirty-two day trial, this Hunterdon County jury of eight men and four women deliberated for a full day. Tonight, at ten-thirty, the sheriff ordered a deputy to climb to the cupola on the courthouse roof and ring the 125-year- old bell. That was the signal here that a verdict had been reached. And what a verdict it is! The defendant has been found guilty of murder in the first degree. The sentence is death. Judge Trenchard has handed the sheriff a warrant ordering the sentence to be carried out sometime during the week of March 18th.”</p>
<p>Margaret lowered her head to her knees and began to sob.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next morning she took the early bus and the night porter let her in at the alley entrance. She climbed the wide staircase to the mezzanine and caught sight of Mr. Fitzgerald, the head doorman, buffing the foyer with what looked like a lamb. The elevators were closed but there was a small private elevator in the back of the store.</p>
<p>She climbed to the seventh floor and turned to the office corridor. At the end of the hall, she stood in front of the glass-topped door. She tapped and waited until she was told to come in. Mr. Rothenberg was sitting behind his desk with his back to a window that looked down on Market Street.</p>
<p>“My dear,” the old man said, starting to get up. “Is the store open?”</p>
<p>“No, sir. It’s still early.”</p>
<p>He fell back to his chair, but not before pointing to a wide chair beside his desk.</p>
<p>This was the first time she’d been in his office though she’d imagined being here hundreds of times. In her imagination she always marched into the room and said she didn’t want to model anymore. In her imagination there was never a feeling of shame that would choke off her words; and there was no fear of losing her job either. She simply said she wouldn’t model, and that was the end of it.</p>
<p>Anyway, now that she here, she didn’t want to mention their Wednesday meetings. Now that she was here, she didn’t feel any urgency at all. In fact, she felt a lessening &#8211; a falling away.</p>
<p>“I’ve been worried about the Lindbergh case,” she said, surprising herself. “I thought maybe the jury would let him go and it would be my fault.”</p>
<p>“My dear, I can’t hear what you’re saying. You need to speak up.”</p>
<p>She sighed.</p>
<p>A moment later, Mr. Rothenberg said, “I’ve decided to retire in the spring.”</p>
<p>“You’re going to retire?”</p>
<p>“I’ll miss the early mornings.”</p>
<p>A stab of sadness went through Margaret as she looked at the old man in his crisp blue suit.&nbsp; His shirt was white and shiny and reminded her of the napkins with the silver threads that she’d been ironing since she was nine.</p>
<p>“I’ll miss feeling the store come alive around me,” he said.</p>
<p>Margaret stood and put her hand on the old man’s shoulder. She kept it there while she inched toward the window and a wider view of Market Street. She slid her hand off Mr. Rothenberg’s shoulder and stepped close enough for her hip to touch the window frame. She didn’t want to press herself against the glass, but no one would want to do that. She touched the cold window with her finger tips.</p>
<p>The sky was overcast but there was a hint of purple under the clouds so it still might end up being the sort of day she loved. She turned and went back to the chair Mr. Rothenberg had pointed to. The old man was sleeping, his head propped on his hands. Margaret sat in the chair and took a deep breath. A moment later, she wiped away the tears that rolled down her face. Then, remembering what Sister Mary Michael used to say, she bowed her head and whispered a prayer of thanksgiving.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The chasm was a long grimace in the mountainside. It narrowed as it went deeper into the earth, but no one knew how deep it went. Three children huddled around the widest part of its opening, which was only a couple of feet across. Each of them wore either too little or too much for the weather. The sun was setting in the Wichita Mountains. Light snow flurries snaked along the boulders all around, and the wind sang low bottle notes into the rock fissure. From within its depths, a child’s voice pleaded for help.</p>
<p>“Let’s all calm down, smoke some cigarettes, and think this over,” Jared said.</p>
<p>“We’re not going to get in trouble if we get help,” Davida said from where she knelt at the lip of the chasm. She pushed her untended hair away from her face and stood. “We’ll be the good guys. So move your butts!”</p>
<p>“You’re the one who got him in there,” Jared said. “Don’t forget that part when you tell your mom.”</p>
<p>“<em>You</em> pushed him in there.”</p>
<p>“You wanted me to. Isn’t that right, Nathan?”</p>
<p>Nathan was silent. He always allied himself with the biggest kid, so he was Jared’s sidekick for their 7<sup>th</sup>-grade year. But Davida had gained something like respect when she’d brought a picture of her tattooed father to a show-and-tell and said that he’d committed suicide last year. She proudly announced that she’d inherited his “strangler hands” and held up her knock-jointed fingers to prove it.</p>
<p>Nathan mumbled something under his breath and looked past the jagged scrawl of the mountains towards the overgrown, bungalow-filled neighborhood where they all lived.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that right—Davida’s basically the one who chased him into that hole?” Jared pressed.</p>
<p>“You did go <em>on and on</em> about finding his ‘moon base,’” Nathan said to her.</p>
<p>“Because he acts like everything’s his,” Davida said. “He has like six bathrooms in his house.”</p>
<p>“Please help,” came the crying voice from the fissure.</p>
<p>“Benjamin, quit being such a wuss and just climb out of there before I karate chop your face in half,” Davida said.</p>
<p>The crying grew louder.</p>
<p>*<br />
Down in the pit, Benjamin was angled headfirst into the earth, his arms pinned loosely to his sides, his feet over a yard away from the surface entrance. His bleeding hands scrabbled for purchase on the stone. Rock dust got into his eyes. He held his breath in his strain to push himself back out, but his matchstick arms couldn’t muster that much force. Triangles of fading sunlight penetrated here and there on the sides of the hole, making a patchwork of geometric figures interrupted by his frail silhouette. Distantly, from somewhere above and therefore seemingly “below” his upside-down feet, he heard Nathan, the smallest among them, grumbling and crawling into the fissure.</p>
<p>Then came Nathan’s voice: “Oh, jeez, you’re really stuck! You’re <em>f’ing</em> deep in there! Guys, come look!”</p>
<p>The awe in Nathan’s voice induced total panic. In a desperation that made the blood rush even more to his face, Benjamin struggled to free his arms. He got his right free and pushed against the sides of the cave to guide his body upwards. But his hand became slick with more blood and melting snow, and he slipped and fell a few inches deeper into the cave.</p>
<p>“Benjamin, why didn’t you just run?” Nathan whispered. “When she kept making us follow you, why didn’t you just run back home?”</p>
<p>Benjamin could hear Jared scoff aboveground. “Everyone quit panicking and smoke a cigarette. Then just pull the stupid fucker out.”</p>
<p>Benjamin felt a gentle pull at his ankles, but he didn’t budge.</p>
<p>“There’s <em>no way</em>,” Nathan whispered to himself and retreated back up the hole.</p>
<p>Benjamin tried to calm himself and think through his predicament. His father had gone into orbit around the moon and had taught him how to think through things one tiny piece at a time. So he first thought about his “angle of entry,” then about the necessary “counter force” to push back out, then about the gravity and “coefficient of friction” that held him in. He pushed against the sides of the rock, ignoring the pain from the splinters in his hands that he’d gotten when Jared threw him into some bushes before chasing him into this pit. He tried to use his legs but found he was only wedging himself deeper into the earth. He took deep breaths but kept his mouth barely open so the floating grit in the fissure wouldn’t get into his lungs any more than it already had.</p>
<p>“Guys, this situation is serious,” he heard Davida say, using the staid, reasoning voice of an adult. “I really think we need to get our parents.”</p>
<p>“I could just text my…” Nathan began.</p>
<p>“Oh, <em>I’ll</em> pull him out,” Jared said. “And I’m keeping your phones.”</p>
<p>Where Nathan could twist and turn into the fissure, Jared’s bigger adolescent body just barely fit. He slowly slid down the hole feet-first, getting bruised and cut along the way.</p>
<p>“Hey, man,” he whispered so only Benjamin could hear. “You don’t have to show us that moon base thingy you got. I’ll never even bring it up again. Davida was the one who was obsessed with finding it, okay. All summer long. ‘The moon base, the moon base. Let’s find the moon base.’ She’s such a little girl. Fuck her. I’m really sorry.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say, ‘Fuck her,’” Benjamin said and immediately felt ridiculous.</p>
<p>He felt two hands take firm hold of his ankle and pull. Pain electrified his flanks and ribs until he forgot all about keeping calm and screamed himself hoarse.</p>
<p>“Jesus,” Jared said.</p>
<p>“What’s going on down there?” Davida asked. “Are you being a dumbass, Jared?”</p>
<p>“Did you get him out?” Nathan asked.</p>
<p>“Why is no one smoking?” Jared shouted back. “Just look in my backpack. Three fat ones.”</p>
<p>“Please, it’s not like you brought pot,” Davida said.</p>
<p>“Jared, Jared,” Benjamin said. “I need you to go get my mom and dad. Now.”</p>
<p>“S<em>hhh.</em> Tell me what’s wrong,” Jared said. “Where does it hurt?”</p>
<p>To Benjamin, Jared’s voice was inappropriately sticky and warm down in the tunnel with only the two of them. Benjamin thrashed and fell a little deeper into the pit, driving his shoulder into a jutting claw of stone that arrested his downslide. He tried to keep still, but stillness only intensified the cold.</p>
<p>“It hurts everywhere,” Benjamin said. “My mom and dad won’t be mad at you. Just get them. I’ll make them pay you.”</p>
<p>“What if he has to pee?” he heard Nathan ask aboveground. “Will it like, drip down his stomach and into his face and stuff? That <em>f’ing</em> sucks!”</p>
<p>“<em>Eww</em>! I’m going to go get help,” Davida said.</p>
<p>But Jared called up to the surface: “They’ll only call the police! Davida? I said, they’ll only call the police. Let me try some more. I only gave him one little tug. Everybody relax.” And to Benjamin, he said, “Okay, I’m going to get you out for sure now. Just grow an extra pair and get ready.”</p>
<p>Benjamin pleaded with him to stop, but Jared grabbed him firmly by both ankles and gave his mightiest pull. Benjamin’s wild screams filled the hole, echoing up and down it, hitting all-new octaves. Dull molars of stone clamped down onto his back, bunching up the flesh there like coiled towels and jackknifing his vertebrae. “Stop, stop, stop!” he begged in between screams, but Jared didn’t cease his unremitting, full-bodied exertion. Benjamin heard things inside himself popping and pulled against his tormentor.</p>
<p>Finally, Jared’s muscles and resolve waned, and he let go. Benjamin’s counter pull rocketed him the deepest yet into the fissure, and he was sure that the jutting abutment of rock now pierced his flesh. Pain came blooming anew in his shoulder every few seconds, making his entire body tremor. His tears fell down an unknown depth.</p>
<p>“Damn dude,” Jared said as he crawled out of the hole.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Aboveground, Nathan was berating Davida, saying, “I’ve always known where his moon base was. I just didn’t want to show you because it’s nothing but his dumb rock collection out in the mountains. He tried to move some speakers out there so he could listen to music. That’s all.”</p>
<p>“How do you know?” Davida asked.</p>
<p>“My dad told me.”</p>
<p>At the mention of “dad,” Davida recoiled. “Liar,” she said as her dark green eyes aged in her pale face. “You don’t know where it is. No one does. No one’s ever found it. We’re going to be the first ones.”</p>
<p>Benjamin’s fresh round of screaming interrupted them.</p>
<p>“God, that sounds so nasty,” Davida said. Her disdain for Benjamin drew the group back together. Jared and Nathan joined her in peering into the hole. “It’s like he’s fucking a pig down there!” she added.</p>
<p>“Yeah, check it out!” Jared cupped his hand around his ear and leaned over the hole with a clown’s smile. “That is the sound of someone literally losing his mind. Give it to her, Ben. You show that pig a good time!”</p>
<p>“No, the pig is giving it to <em>him</em>,” Davida said with a crone’s smile.</p>
<p>Nathan made such a show of laughing that he fell onto the ground. His face was agonized with mirth.</p>
<p>“It just makes you want to leave him there for a while,” Davida said.</p>
<p>“Yeah, just totally bury him alive until he learns his lesson,” Jared said.</p>
<p>“And stops being so nasty!” Davida said.</p>
<p>“Don’t hurt that pig, Benjamin. That’s animal cruelty. Mrs. Nelson is going to make us write our senator again.”</p>
<p>He kicked some snow and dirt into the chasm. Benjamin’s screaming stopped. Jared kicked more down. Then Benjamin’s begging voice drifted up to them, and Jared started imitating it in a whiny way, “No, stop, please, <em>wah wah wah</em>!” He crossed his arms. “If I acted like that, my dad would kick my ass.”</p>
<p>Davida winced, and her face was full of loathing. “Jared, shut up before I karate chop your brain open.”</p>
<p>He stared at her, confused, as if she had violated some long-standing arrangement for no reason. Then he shrugged and said, “Hey, Nathan, I’m going to get the cigarettes out, okay?”</p>
<p>Nathan looked at Davida and let his gaze stray off towards the trees and boulders surrounding them. Davida fingered the rips in her jacket that she’d gotten from wrestling with Benjamin, when he’d refused to show them his moon base. She knew that last summer, Benjamin and his father set up the moon base somewhere in the Wichitas, and ever since, Davida had wanted to see something a father had built. But even when she held Benjamin down and Jared stood on top of his legs, he refused to reveal its secret location. Her hands and forearms still felt weak from the effort.</p>
<p>In the silence, Nathan whispered, “Maybe if we throw down a bunch of water, it’ll make it slippery, and he’ll be able to get out.”</p>
<p>“Or cooking oil from the kitchen,” Jared agreed.</p>
<p>“WD-40 from the garage,” Nathan said.</p>
<p>“Hey, I could get the sex jelly from my parent’s bedroom!” Jared said.</p>
<p>“Banana peels!” Nathan shouted victoriously. “Bunches, all packed in around him!”</p>
<p>“We got a lot to try,” Jared said, nodding. “We have a <em>long</em> way to go before anyone’s parents need to know.”</p>
<p>Davida looked at the sunset and the clouds riding in on a fast wind. It would be a cold night in the mountains. Benjamin had gone quiet again. She leaned over the rust-colored pit but couldn’t see him. The smell of desiccated leaves and winter flowed up from the fissure. Suddenly, she felt heavy with the knowledge of death. Death was standing with them over the cave, peering into its depths alongside them. In her dreams, her father didn’t know he was dead. Sometimes he’d come to give her a piggyback ride, and she’d have to explain again that he shot himself a year ago. He would look disappointed and then decay into a corpse in front of her. As she looked down into Benjamin’s cave, the heaviness of knowing death made her head bow lower, as if she were going to pray. She <em>was </em>the one who’d led the group to Benjamin, who’d scared him so badly he scrambled into the fissure to get away from them. And now, they both were stuck.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Darkness. His enemies had gone, and there was silence except when the wind made half-formed vowels in the fissure. He had never known such silence. He realized that until now, he’d never been truly alone, never truly out of reach of anyone. And the first thing he realized about this zero gravity of solitude was that he was no longer a complete person, no longer a Benjamin Spirer but just a voice that was not heard, a touch that was not felt, a force without Newton’s equal and opposite reaction.</p>
<p>Such fear seized him that he forgot who he was, so at first, the sound of his own name was nonsense.</p>
<p>“Benjamin?” That was a girl’s voice saying a recognizable sound. A special girl he hated, whom he’d gladly trade places with that very instant. This hatred, with its concrete immediacy, brought him back to himself.</p>
<p>“He’s down there, Mrs. Spirer,” Davida said.</p>
<p>“Benjamin?” called his mother.</p>
<p>Benjamin screamed for his mother, screamed until the blood engorged his temples, screamed so hard his exhale blasted grit into his eyes. The pain demanded that he rub the grit out, but his arms were stuck. This denial of instinct sent Benjamin into snot-producing convulsions.</p>
<p>“Honey, people are on their way,” she said. He could hear her trying to lower herself into the hole with him. “Firemen, doctors, everybody. Even Dr. Patel, the one who gave you the stickers.”</p>
<p>When Benjamin heard the ambulance’s sirens, he tried to have faith in America’s Professionals. Besides, his father the astronaut was among that group. Soon, there were several indistinct, new voices asking questions, of his mother and of him. “Do you hurt anywhere? Are you bleeding? Can you wiggle your fingers and toes?”</p>
<p>“Here’s a blanket I brought,” his mother said. “I’ll lower it down.”</p>
<p>“No! Don’t!”</p>
<p>“What’s the matter? You need it to be warm.”</p>
<p>The blanket slithered over his feet, enveloping his legs. It was a dark manta ray that was descending upon him, ready to cover him whole.</p>
<p>“Davida, make her stop! Davida!”</p>
<p>“Okay, sweetheart, okay,” his mother said, and the horrible thing was taken away.</p>
<p>Camera flashes lit the fissure around him until he heard his mother cursing as she never cursed in front of him. Searchlights turned on. White light filtered into the cave, stinging his eyes in the most wonderful way. Now he could make out what lay beneath him. Four feet below, there was rock bed the ashen color of the moon.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Davida watched the rescuers work by the searchlights. They camped and took shifts. They found a way to snake a tube of water down to Benjamin. The snow blanketed everything all around. The searchlights cast their glow far out over the Wichitas. Lichen-crusted, orange boulders and weather-blasted trees surrounded them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Spirer sat at the lip of the chasm and prayed as erosion tracks lined her face. She was a tall woman who never wore makeup. Her hair was purple and jagged, and she had a beautiful, freckled face. She covered part of the pit’s entrance with a blanket in a futile attempt to keep out the wind. She nestled herself a couple feet into the hole as if it were an egg-laden nest and made room only for the paramedics. Benjamin called to her.</p>
<p>“We can’t just drill down to him,” said one man with a hard hat. “The cave might collapse. We’ll have to drill around him, beneath him, and up to him.”</p>
<p>“How long will that take?” asked Mrs. Spirer.</p>
<p>“Hours. Days. We have no way of knowing how much is dirt and how much is rock beneath us.”</p>
<p>“How many drills do you have? I can pay for—”</p>
<p>“It ain’t about pay for. We got our drill here, and some military contractors out at Fort Sill are giving us two within the hour. By tomorrow morning, every nearby town from Altus to Ardmore will donate whatever they got, too. We’re going to get your son out.”</p>
<p>Davida crouched nearby, besides some bushes, and told herself she didn’t care if she froze to death that night. Someone draped a jacket over her shoulders. She resettled into her crouch. She didn’t know it, but she actually stepped into Benjamin’s moon base. Her very foot planted right next to his favorite stone, a big glob of granite and quartz that was pale like the moon. She hugged her arms over her knees and watched Benjamin’s mother. Davida cried unselfishly, keeping it to herself, not attracting anyone’s attention away from the hole and Benjamin. She felt something strange within her grow roots, something strange enough to withstand all of this terrible cold.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Benjamin thought about the temperature of space, about suns going out in the void. Maybe all the stars had frozen already but, traveling at the speed of darkness, their demise had not yet reached earth. Benjamin couldn’t feel his body anymore: his existence was entirely in his blood-engorged face. And now, across that face where his existence had coalesced like a centuries-slow droplet of water forming on the tip of a stalactite, something crawled. Hairy, unfamiliar feet made its way along his cheek. It inched towards his right eye, then paused. It walked towards his mouth, tentatively feeling along the skin. Some legs perched on his nose, and Benjamin imagined that the thing was going to cover his entire face and devour it. His father was not there to remove it. That was because his father was perfect, and perfection did not deign to intervene.</p>
<p>Benjamin tried not to sob, but he couldn’t help but let out a spasm of swallowed crying. This startled the thing, so it quickly made its way up his face, but with one back leg nestled in the groove between upper and lower lip. Benjamin had the impulse to quickly open his mouth and bite the thing’s limb off.</p>
<p>His mind lost focus, like a camera pressed too close to something. The thing started creeping up into his hair, curiously exploring with its forelegs. Eventually, he was never sure whether it was there or not.</p>
<p>Days. He’d been down there for days. He didn’t know how many. Even more than he wanted water, Benjamin wanted to know the time. His thirst for the time was unquenchable, and those above would not give it to him. He constantly asked for it. They constantly lied. According to some rescuers, it had been eight-o’-clock for hours now. Even his own mother betrayed him. It was never as late as it really was, he was never in there for as long as he really had been. Everyone above insisted on okay-ness, on you’re-doing-real-good-Benjamin!, on you’re-almost-out-of-there-Benjamin! He wanted people to be honest and say, You’ve been down there for half a week, Benjamin. We have no clue how to get you out, Benjamin. You’re going to die, Benjamin.</p>
<p>He could no longer differentiate sunlight, moonlight, and searchlight. The drilling got closer. Every now and then, someone annoyed him with questions like, “Are you bleeding anywhere?” But to these inquiries, he said whatever was expected so that they’d leave him alone. Every so often, a hand touched his ankle and a voice announced, “His pulse is still strong.”</p>
<p>Finally, he stopped paying attention to the world above. Even when the drilling was so near that it rattled his teeth, he didn’t much care. The echoes and vibrations barely disturbed him as he took his space voyages from waking to sleeping and back. He was ready to find new secret places, to build a new moon base that no one would ever be able to find. He struggled downwards towards the light below him, giving desperate pelvic thrusts, grasping the sides of the tunnel and pulling on its uneven surface. He slid and jerked earthwards, not caring anymore about being wedged too tightly or having his lungs crushed, inching along slowly until his right shoulder refused to go any further over that ever-present jutting rock that had been his personal demon for so long now. In his tormented contortions, he started to feel slick and smooth like a pink fillet. He cut himself everywhere, and the wounds acted like glands secreting a lubricating sebum. His shoulder finally slid past the claw of stone. He thought he would feel incredible relief, but he simply felt numb there. The numbness spread.</p>
<p>He fought harder. And then, with a golden satisfaction, he touched the lower rock bed below with an outstretched, dripping hand. He gave death throe twists.</p>
<p>Voices echoed in the rock chamber: “Hold on son!” “We’re going to go to the rock museum, Benjamin!” “You okay?” “We’re coming!”</p>
<p>He finally slid free and landed on the incredibly soft cave bed below. He was in a tunnel. Up ahead, the white light pulsed invitingly. He stumbled towards it and discovered that the glow emanated from a pool full of strange gems, each like a summer-blue afterimage of sunlight. He imagined the little lake was a watery artifact from the magical center of the planet. His thirst disappeared.</p>
<p>From the far side of the water’s edge, a female figure wrapped in a wet, bright white cloth glided over the water. She was completely encased in the clinging, translucent material. She was naked underneath, but this didn’t seem bad. She moved without disturbing her attire and without moving her feet. Benjamin grew heavy with sleepiness. The blindingly bright figure came closer.</p>
<p>“Shine that light down on him…”</p>
<p>“I’ve got to use the drill!”</p>
<p>“You’ll crush him!”</p>
<p>“I don’t have a pulse—I lost the pulse!”</p>
<p>“We don’t have time anymore. Benjamin! Let’s hear about your dad being a spaceman!”</p>
<p>Benjamin took the bright thing’s hand and found he could walk with her over the surface of the waters. She began teaching him a dance. He had never danced before. Her arms were strong and she kept his neck erect and held him tightly. His little feet kicked. Her hands were soft and warm, but sometimes she was so bright that he had to close his eyes.</p>
<p>Benjamin heard cheering and applause. He thought that he must be in a ballroom. His dance was impressive, and those were the sounds of approval. His legs dangled and wriggled, his head threatened to bob and sway, and his arms made lovely motions through the air. His partner was really Davida, the girl of his dreams.</p>
<p>“Bring him up here…thank God…oh God…move, move, move!”</p>
<p>“Is he breathing? Get the BVM over here.”</p>
<p>“Help the man…get the backboard and stretcher ready. Secure his back, Jesus you just pulled him out.”</p>
<p>“Had no choice—lost the pulse…”</p>
<p><em>Almost to the moon</em>. <em>Dad is probably there again by now. </em><em>Except this time, he’ll actually touch down and walk on it, and this time, he’ll have a place for me, a campfire. And I’ll walk into the circle of its light and be there with him.</em></p>
<p>The woman of light wrapped her arms like a vice around Benjamin, leaned close to his face, and slid her tongue into his mouth. Benjamin had expected his first kiss to feel pleasant, but this was a strange pain. After her tongue went down his throat, she rhythmically breathed into him.</p>
<p>“Intubate him.”</p>
<p>“Got it.”</p>
<p>“Start the chest compressions.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>When they pulled him out, there was explosive cheering and bursts of camera flashes. The lights outlined Benjamin’s lank silhouette. A fireman held Benjamin as still as he could. The boy’s limbs dangled uselessly beneath him. His head and neck, which looked stretched out and unnaturally straight, were placed in a brace as soon as a paramedic could get to him. They laid the boy on the backboard and stretcher.</p>
<p>Davida shielded her eyes from the camera flashes as they took Benjamin to an ambulance. Interviewers descended upon the rescuers, who smiled unconvincingly at the cameras. Benjamin’s mother barged into the ambulance with her son, and Davida ran to its doors. As they swung closed, she saw Benjamin laid among white linens. The crowd applauded when the ambulance drove away.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Over the years, Davida took to wandering the mountains near the fissure. The town had fenced off the dangerous cave. People put delicate flowers for Benjamin on the rusted barbed wire. She often watched the morning sheen on the metal, the way it burned through the translucent petals.</p>
<p>At Benjamin’s visitation, Benjamin’s handsome Ivy League father had made all the kids laugh by showing that he could walk on his hands. He did this in the hallway of the funeral home, right outside a cold room that used to be a kitchen. Davida, not knowing what else to do, showed that she could walk on her hands, too. She and Benjamin’s father laughed together, but his laughter frightened her. She wondered where he’d been while his son’s life faded away in a hole.</p>
<p>Later, Davida fell extremely ill inside the showing room. Within the casket, whose plush inner cover was fitted with a canvas print of the American flag, Benjamin’s face was obviously absent of Benjamin. He did not “look like he was sleeping,” as some of the adults said. He looked like he’d left the building. There was an incredible <em>not-there-ness</em>. The corpse had nothing to do with him. She’d never seen a dead body before—her father’s funeral was closed casket. And yet, she still felt she hadn’t seen death firsthand. In Benjamin, there was merely the absence of life, which was something else entirely.</p>
<p>One summer, when Davida had begun to cut her hair short and jagged, she got curious while taking a walk near Saddle Hill. She wondered what was directly behind a thicket of trees off the path, near a table of rock. After the brambles cut her arms and face, after she stepped past the remnants of cigarettes that had gone unsmoked, after she forced herself through the interlacing branches, she broke free into a hollow depression on the mountainside. Her breath caught. For a fleeting moment, she believed she was on the surface of the moon.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My boyfriend is moving to Mongolia. He tells me this in February, when he’s not my boyfriend, but rather some guy I sleep with on weekend nights. “Mongolia,” I say. “That’s amazing.” Then I search for my bra in the sheets. Soon we are dating and he is moving to Mongolia and I’m moving on, too. I don’t sleep much. I learn Mongolia is icy; the coldest capital in the world. There are dangerous levels of Uranium in the drinking water. Ex-pats date native women half their age. I find pictures of these couplings on the Internet. I tell him this, flip through photos of women on my phone. By August he is my boyfriend and he is moving to Mongolia and we shop for wool pants. I ache for him already. He asks to go away for a weekend; says in Mongolia he won’t see the ocean for a year. I veto Cabo. Tell him, “Men with machetes roam Tulum.”</p>
<p>We leave for Carlsbad at dusk. The sun is setting; whitecaps blister the Bay. We don’t say this is our last trip together, instead we eat milk duds and twizzlers; speed past Las Vegas in the dead of night. At dawn we drive through New Mexico, where sagebrush tats the road like lace. We’re both from San Francisco and each time we drive onto a bluff we think we’ll see the Bay. We keep saying that—“there should be ocean down there,” we say—but there isn’t, just cacti and tumbleweeds, and in the distance, thunderclouds blooming like abrasions on the sky.</p>
<p>We get gas outside Roswell. Light shadows the suburbs in the shape of a dick.</p>
<p>“Look.” I shake Ben awake.</p>
<p>“Are you trying to tell me something?”</p>
<p>“It’s beautiful,” I say.</p>
<p>In Carlsbad, the sky is charcoal. Wind whips the car like an angry hand. All week Ben has read news reports about protests at the caverns, angry ranchers boycotting government grazing fees on their land. So far it’s quiet. There’s no one else here. We sleep for an hour, stretched out in the backseat. When we wake, the sun is gauzy, fishnetted in cloud.</p>
<p>My heart’s pounding.</p>
<p>“I’m dying,” I tell Ben.</p>
<p>“It’s the Red Bull,” he says.</p>
<p>“Should I take Aspirin?”</p>
<p>I already have four in my hand.</p>
<p>In the parking lot, we meet an elderly couple. “Caving here since 1964,” Nan says, extending a hand. She’s wearing an “I Love Arizona” shirt. Her husband is already panting.</p>
<p>“He’s moving to Mongolia,” I say, gesturing toward Ben.</p>
<p>“Mongolia,” Nan exclaims. “I’ve never been.” She tells us to visit King’s Cavern, a small tunnel you slide through on your front. “It’s beginner.”</p>
<p>“How beginner?” Ben asks.</p>
<p>The trail into the cave is muddy. The dirt bucks and ripples, forming craters like colanders that catch the heels of my boots. 250 million years ago these caverns existed as ocean reef, far below an inland sea. The walls still look like coral, dalmationed with gashes and holes. The trail is illuminated every four feet by small spotlights. Ben and I move slowly, our eyes adjusting to the dark.</p>
<p>“Do you know how to tell the difference between stalagmites and stalactites?” Ben asks.</p>
<p>He’s walking behind me, his breath on my neck.</p>
<p>“Stalactites sound like lactate.” I say. “Milk drips down.”</p>
<p>“I suppose you could remember it that way.”</p>
<p>The path cuts sharply to the left, skirting a thin pillar. In the car, we watched a video on stalactite formation. Ben wanted to move on, but I was fascinated by the process: drops of water that clung to the ceiling long enough solidified there, becoming part of the cave’s speleothem. I want that to happen to us—for Ben to hang around long enough to get stuck with me. I knew this girl whose boyfriend moved to Mongolia. Actually my friend Isabel knew her, but it’s the same, the girl followed him, not forever, just to visit for the summer. They still didn’t work. She married someone else. Imagine telling your next boyfriend you followed an ex to Ulaanbaatar. It’s embarrassing.</p>
<p>Past the pillar, the opening of the cave disappears. In the half-light, I glance at Ben. His skin looks ghoulish; shadows appear beneath his eyes like pools. I stop to take a photograph and he cuts ahead of me, walking toward a rock formation that looks like an iceberg. Within seconds, he disappears. I pick my way down the path, searching for him in the darkness. I round a corner and suddenly he’s charging me. He runs full tilt, bent at the waist, face obscured. He’s never screamed at me before, but I feel sure he will now. I cower back against the railing, stomach sucked in, hands crossed at my chest. As the man passes, I realize it’s not Ben at all, but a teenager hurrying toward fresh air.</p>
<p>I catch my breath on the landing and head down. Ben’s waiting patiently at the next turn. “Look,” he says, gesturing to a boulder called Iceberg Rock. “Jack and Rose.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Couples who had it worse than us.” He lists more: Romeo and Juliet, Humbert and Lolita, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony.</p>
<p>“Romeo didn’t move to Mongolia.”</p>
<p>“Maybe he should have.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so,” I say.</p>
<p>Up ahead, there’s a boulder blocking the path. The stone is smooth, garnished in moss.</p>
<p>“Need a hand?” Ben says, holding out his arm.</p>
<p>“I can do it.”</p>
<p>“I know you can.”</p>
<p>His hand is still outstretched, dangling between us like bait. I step over the rock, cutting my knee on a jagged section.</p>
<p>“Put your hand down then,” I say.</p>
<p>Because I’m not supposed to say no to Mongolia, I’ve replaced that no with others: <em>no </em>to Cabo, <em>no</em> to the hand, <em>no</em> don’t touch me, <em>no. </em>I used to think relationships were about compromise. Now I know they’re like being embalmed—safe and comforting once you accept your vocal chords have been pulled out through your nose.</p>
<p>Ben hops the rock.</p>
<p>“Ready?” he asks.</p>
<p>Yes, when I’m walking. Again when you leave.</p>
<p>We hike until the ceiling opens up. The view above looks like how I imagine Earth through a telescope: a long tube of grey, and beyond that, a round smear of blue sky and tawny hills, the stalactites jutting from the rock like rotting teeth. It’s raining. The drops fly diagonal, streaking the ground like paint. We stand in the oval, faces pointed up.</p>
<p>“We’re getting wet,” Ben says.</p>
<p>“Humans are waterproof,” I say.</p>
<p>He pulls me toward him; sweeps his tongue through my mouth. I lean into him. He tastes salty. The water collects in a small pond at our feet.</p>
<p>“Hey,” someone shouts, and I unhinge Ben’s mouth from mine, pull my palm from his lower back. “Some dude’s having a heart attack.” I blink at the stranger. Even in the darkness I can tell he’s massive, his upper arms hanging like flags at half-mast. He has two kids with him. They point toward the previous switchback.</p>
<p>I don’t want to walk back up and I can tell Ben doesn’t either, but we do, panting as we hike. When we reach the spot, we find the “I love Arizona” man leaning against the railing and clutching his chest. His wife stands beside him, her arms crossed.</p>
<p>“Are you alright?’ I say.</p>
<p>“He’s fine,” Nan says. “He can’t hear.”</p>
<p>The man is in bad shape. Sweat pours down his face, staining the back of his shirt. I shiver, sure the wet will make him cold.</p>
<p>“Is everything okay?” I repeat, but he says nothing.</p>
<p>Nan unlatches her husband’s hand from the railing and pulls him onto the path. In the darkness, I can just make out the whites of his eyes. At the next bend, I look back. He’s stopped again. Nan’s ahead of him, scowling, and I wonder if that will be me in 40 years, pulling a man down behind me and not stopping to listen. In that instant, I want to grab Ben and tell him everything, how much I love him and how I hate him for leaving, but when I start to speak he pulls back. “It’s only a year, Soph. No time at all.”</p>
<p>But a year is tons of time. In a year, the Carlsbad Caverns could cave in. A tsunami could come off the Gulf and cover the desert in sea.</p>
<p>“You could meet someone else,” I say.</p>
<p>“So could you.”</p>
<p>“But that’s even worse,” I say.</p>
<p>The more we walk, the darker it gets. We pass beneath a boulder draped like a huppah and I step closer to Ben, wondering if we see the same things. Past that, an array of stalactites labeled “Spirit World” protrudes from the wall. Early explorers thought these pale rocks looked like angels.</p>
<p>“They’re angels,” Ben says.</p>
<p>“They’re rocks.”</p>
<p>Up close, I’m right. The stones are yellow and waxy, like my teeth after I’ve had a bad week and haven’t really brushed.</p>
<p>“They look like candy corn to me,” Nan calls down.</p>
<p>Beyond the Spirit World, the trail opens into a large room. We stand at a four-point intersection. To our right, the wall is soft and contoured, like an egg crate upside-down.</p>
<p>“I’m going to the little boy’s,” Ben says, his steps echoing as he walks away.</p>
<p>I used to listen to the sounds of my roommate fighting with her boyfriend. She would scream, throw a slipper, then a plate, then cry on the pavement outside. Ben and I’ve never fought like that. “I don’t ever want to,” he said, when we heard them, his bicep curled beneath my neck. “Of course not,” I whispered, but now I long for that moment, to scream at him and break something. In the parking lot, Nan warned us that that our voices would travel—like speaking on a still lake.</p>
<p>In the cave, I find a small pool. The rocks surrounding it are smooth and sloping; the water pine. I take off my shoes and step in. The ground is slick and sudsy. Water laps at my waist like strange hands in a bar. I walk until it reaches my ribs. Ben would never go swimming here. He doesn’t wade when he can’t see the bottom. I wonder if it’s the same with our relationship—if he only entered it knowing he would leave.</p>
<p>I hear footsteps and turn. The Dale’s are standing on the edge. Larry’s mouth is downturned. His face is the color of fresh snow.</p>
<p>“How’s the water?” Nan asks.</p>
<p>“Lovely,” I say.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry about your boyfriend,” she says, stepping in. Her head looks like a planet, bobbing in space. “It must be awful that he’s leaving you.”</p>
<p>“We’re both moving on.”</p>
<p>“You’re not going to Mongolia.”</p>
<p>“That’s true,” I say.</p>
<p>She takes my hand and squeezes. In the water, her palm is steel wool.</p>
<p>I know things won’t work out with Ben. I’m no idiot. I’ve done distance before. When my boyfriend and I finally saw one another then, all he could say was, “I miss you,” like he’d forgotten how to talk to me, like leaving once had taken all of me away. We went sky diving. I think he really badly needed to push me out of a plane. But when we got up high and the wind was blowing, the instructor made him jump first. I’ll never forget the look he gave me as he leapt, his blonde hair blowing, his arms chimneyed up toward me, his lips forming the words <em>I miss you</em>. I didn’t jump after that. I just rode the plane back down.</p>
<p>“I miss you,” I tell Ben now.</p>
<p>“Already?” he says.</p>
<p>“Still.”</p>
<p>He looks at me. “You’re all wet.”</p>
<p>“Let’s carve our names in the cave.”</p>
<p>“We can’t do that.”</p>
<p>“Come on. We can write them really small.”</p>
<p>“These walls are thousands of years old.” He passes me a towel. “We can’t scratch them.”</p>
<p>“Let’s get tattoos then,” I say.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with you?”</p>
<p>My socks are wet, like walking on sponge. There’s water in my ears. My boyfriend is moving to Mongolia. Sometimes he’s so quiet I want to pry open his mouth.</p>
<p>“Did you say something?” I ask.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Well can you?”</p>
<p>“We should’ve gone to Cabo.”</p>
<p>“This is Cabo underground.” I point toward the Dales. Nan and Larry are lying beside the pool, spread on the shore like sunbathers.</p>
<p>We walk forward, until a stalactite hangs above us, it’s shaft smooth and long, the end bunching at the bottom like tulle.</p>
<p>“It looks like a lion’s tail,” Ben says.</p>
<p>“I don’t think so,” I say. “It looks like a plunger to me.”</p>
<p>“Is something wrong?”</p>
<p>“You’re leaving me.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean to.”</p>
<p>“You did too,” I say. Then I list the various applications he put in to work abroad, the internship farming in Malaysia, the Fulbright in Greece, the fellowship in England, the teaching job in Mongolia.</p>
<p>“I have to go.”</p>
<p>But that’s not true either. Ben thinks living abroad will make him braver. I know better. He’ll be the same person in Mongolia he is in this cave, just with stomach bugs and without me.</p>
<p>“You didn’t even take me into consideration.”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t ready to,” he says.</p>
<p>I stand under the plunger for a long moment and wish for it to fall. It doesn’t. Instead, the features of the cave seem to shift in the darkness. When I look up, I see the night sky, the water drops winking like stars. Everything down here mirrors something above. It’s the same with Ben—yesterday we were in a hotel and today we’re in a cave and next week we’ll be driving to the airport, and always, I’ll think, I could do this forever, but he’ll still be leaving and I’ll still be left.</p>
<p>“Are we going to sleep with other people?” I ask.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the lights go out. Someone screams. All around us, people are calling, “Wait, where’s?” and trailing off. Somehow, the children have multiplied. They cry out in the darkness.</p>
<p>Ben takes my hand.</p>
<p>“How are we gonna keep in touch?”</p>
<p>“The power’s out.”</p>
<p>“I mean in Mongolia. Is there Internet?”</p>
<p>“Shh.”</p>
<p>“What about Christmas?” I ask. “Could we see each other then?”</p>
<p>A stream of light appears near the bathrooms, then flickers and goes dark. Two headlamps move toward us. In the darkness, the lights look like colored ornaments, or the pictures the doctors show you of the magnetic fluid they inject to read abnormalities in your brain. Ben stands on his tip-toes and cranes his neck. “Focus,” he tells me. “Live here and now.” But I’ve never lived like that, which is why I know the instant the headlamps reach us they won’t be rangers, but protestors. We’ll never get a chance to speak about this again. The headlamps pass beneath an Emergency Exit sign and for an instant, I catch a flash of metal like the barrel of a gun. There’s no noise but the sounds of our breathing, the old man’s cough, the pounding of the two strangers moving forward. The protestors walk in sync until they reach us. One is tall, the other short and round. Both are wearing black facemasks. They are Frank and Geoff Ridgeway, fighting federal land use of their land. Frank climbs a low stalagmite and presses his flashlight under his chin. His legs are spread wide on the rock, like even in the dark he has a big dick and he wants us to know it.</p>
<p>For a long moment, nobody speaks.</p>
<p>“We have dinner reservations,” Ben finally says.</p>
<p>Geoff laughs and for the first time I feel scared. “We have dinner reservations,” he mimics. He looks like a straw someone’s sucked on, his head’s bent the wrong way.</p>
<p>“Hey,” Frank says “We don’t have to be assholes.”</p>
<p>“Shut up,” Geoff says, and socks him. In the darkness, it’s hard to make out who’s who, but I hear the sound of boots on skin. Frank topples off the stalagmite and skids across the ground. The headlamps bounce off the walls. I remember a sit-in like this in Oregon, I just don’t remember if everyone died.</p>
<p>“I don’t like this,” Frank says. “There’s kids down here, man.”</p>
<p>There’s a sound like a gunshot and I realize it is one. The shots echo in the cavern, or maybe Geoff’s just shooting again and again. Rock splinters and that sound echoes too. I think how dangerous it is to shoot in a cave. The children are screaming. The fat man covers their ears. Larry is panting on the ground. Bits of cave rain down around us, cutting our skin.</p>
<p>Ben grabs my shoulder and pulls me down. We lie on our stomachs, hands overhead. The ground is damp, the rocks jagged. They cut into my thighs, drawing litmus tests on my skin and staining my shorts. I’ve only brought one pair for this weekend. I don’t want them dirty. I have to wear them to dinner tonight.</p>
<p>Ben puts his lips to my ear. “Are you okay?” he says.</p>
<p>Above us, the ceiling is dripping steadily, like standing by the Golden Gate Bridge in a fog. The water mixes with the blood coming off my eye lid.</p>
<p>“I’m bleeding,” I say.</p>
<p>“Oh no.”</p>
<p>I squint at him. His face is as cut up as mine. There’s a rock in his forehead; shards line his chin like blinds. They bleed orange into one another; they remind me of Passover candy, each welt lined with gummy rind.</p>
<p>“You’re bleeding too,” I say.</p>
<p>Ben says we met in an airport. I say it was English class—we were standing in a hallway. He asked me how to pronounce Balzac. I told him “ball sack,” and ran. This isn’t right either, but it’s closer to the truth. What really happened is this: We saw each other in an airport and I ditched him, I didn’t want to be late for class. Years later, we had sex on accident. It was supposed to be my first one-night stand. So I get why he goes with the airport story. It’s works well with the Mongolia narrative. Also it’s transitional. But I’m working on the truth.</p>
<p>“I can’t get a tattoo,” Ben says now. The blood has dried on his nose. It’s clumped like a raison by his lip.</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>Ben is silent. I move closer to him, tangling my hands in my hair. His breath is warm against my skin.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” he whispers. “People will see.”</p>
<p>The cave is black.</p>
<p>“It’s dark,” I say. “I can’t see my own hands.”</p>
<p>“You need to eat something.”</p>
<p>“It’ll still be dark.”</p>
<p>“Have some banana.” He roots in the backpack.</p>
<p>“I don’t want your banana,” I say.</p>
<p>My words echo in the cavern. The stalactites above seem to sway. Ben and I sit still for a long while, until my back aches and my hands go numb.</p>
<p>“Say something,” I whisper.</p>
<p>“You’re mad at me.”</p>
<p>“Not if you talk.”</p>
<p>Ben looks at his watch. “Do you think the car will be towed?” he asks. “We parked in day parking. Maybe the Park Service thinks we’re illegally spending the night.”</p>
<p>“She doesn’t want you to talk about the car,” Nan says.</p>
<p>“Don’t you have anything to say about Mongolia?”</p>
<p>“I hope we get out of here and I get there,” he says.</p>
<p>Sometime later, the children cry and the fat man asks for the banana and Ben hands it to him. “That was nice of you,” I say, and Ben reaches for me, our knuckles catching in the dark. I think he wants to touch me again or say something but then Frank walks past and Ben pulls back. It’s like he’s already disappeared. Beside us, Larry and Nan are laying on the rock, their arms wrapped around one another like vines. I count the spaces between Ben’s breaths. “Anything else?” I say.</p>
<p>“Stop asking him that,” Frank says.</p>
<p>He’s wearing boots and black jeans.</p>
<p>“How long will we be here?” Ben asks.</p>
<p>“Until the Fed signs off on our demands.”</p>
<p>I can tell Ben wants to ask what branch of the Fed specifically, so I place a hand over his mouth and feel his breath warm and wet on my palm. At some point, Geoff passes out miniature bottles of water. Then he and Frank settle onto a stalagmite fifty yard away. The rock is slated, pyramided at the top like a Hershey kiss. Frank’s pit bull attacked Geoff’s terrier last week. They’re arguing about it. Maybe the rock looks like a nipple. Or the profile of Ben’s face when he’s turned away.</p>
<p>Ben has goosebumps now and I think, summer’s gone.</p>
<p>I stand up.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Frank says.</p>
<p>“I have to pee.”</p>
<p>“I’ll take you,” he says.</p>
<p>“We weren’t done talking,” Geoff says, but Frank ignores him, sliding down the rock and landing on his heels. His boots slap the smooth rock. I look at Ben to see if he’ll stop me, if he’ll say “We weren’t done talking too,” but he’s picking the blood off his face, his lips pressed together, eyes stale.</p>
<p>Frank grabs me. His hands are sandpaper and I yell. The shout feels good. I do it again and stare at Ben.</p>
<p>“Shut up,” Frank says.</p>
<p>He pulls me along the rock. We walk in silence, his gun inches from my spine. At some point, he turns off his headlamp. Without it the dark is so strong I think it’ll swallow us whole. Every so often, one of the children screams.</p>
<p>Frank stops when we reach the bathrooms. He pushes me against a stall, one hand pressed across my mouth, the other at my back and I think, <em>1 in 4.</em></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>But I’m wrong. He just bends his head toward my ear and whispers, “Geoff is a dick.”</p>
<p>I try to say something but with his hand on my face like that no words come out. I’m basically Frenching his palm. I go slack and he releases me, pushing me further into a stall. I stumble onto the toilet seat and wipe my mouth on my hand. My mother used to make Jello molds with Jesus figurines in the center for Easter. Frank feels like that.</p>
<p>“Ditch Geoff,” I say. Then I tell him about Oregon. About protestors being shot by SWAT teams. “Take me out. Get a pity deal. You’ll be a hero.”</p>
<p>“What about your boyfriend?”</p>
<p>“He’s moving to Mongolia,” I say.</p>
<p>Frank’s eyebrows hover above his forehead like the fabric of an umbrella bent off its stretchers by the wind. “Mongolia,” he says. “That’s crazy.”</p>
<p>I hold out my hand. It hangs between us, a waning moon.</p>
<p>“Do we have a deal?” I ask.</p>
<p>Back with Ben, I pretend everything is fine. He does the same, stroking my hand with his thumb, and I wonder if this is what every relationship turns to—both of you holding your breath underground, trying not to scream. Somehow, Ben falls asleep. He breathes heavily, his snores harmonizing with Larry’s like choristers.</p>
<p>I lay still, and when Frank takes my hand hours, or maybe seconds later, I’m ready. I slip off my shoes and we move into the darkness. We walk quietly, tip toeing on the smooth rocks. It’s cold and I shiver. We pass a series of stacked stalactites. Illuminated it looked like whale’s teeth, now it resembles melted wax. We pick our way upward, using the railing to find the way. Within minutes, we reach a break in the cavern’s ceiling, a scope through which we can see the sky. The sun is rising. It paints streaks on the boulders. Frank’s hair is dust-colored and lank. Pink scars line his neck. They look bouncy, like if I threw a penny at them it would bounce back. He looks the same age as my little brother, with a gauzy mustache and cloudy eyes. I want to ask him how he got wrapped up in this, if everything will be okay, but instead I step in front of him and lead the way.</p>
<p>Past the window the cave is darker than before. It smells bad, like something spoiled, and I realize we’re passing bats, thousands of them, black velvet on the walls. It’s windy and we climb quickly. The darkness fades. In the light, I see Frank’s teeth are corn yellow; like cardboard sliced in sections and glued onto his gums.</p>
<p>We pass Iceberg Rock. There’s a small sign explaining that the boulder fell from the ceiling 20,000 years ago, creating this hole. I wonder if that’s what I’m doing to my relationship, abandoning my boyfriend in this cave. But then I remember Mongolia and the way Ben refuses to talk late at night. I know I should stop, go back, shake him awake, whisper that I love him and that everything will be okay, but all I can do is press upwards, feel the stitch in my side, the dirt beneath me, see the cave grey, my skin greyer. And suddenly I’m running toward sky.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The big news was that we had a college student from the Mainland as a summer missionary. The Wai‘anae Church was sharing one of its three summer missionaries with us. They kept Lorna McMichaels, a pasty blonde with thick legs from Dallas, Texas, and Jim Sheridan, a bean pole with the biggest Adam’s apple I’d ever seen, and gave us David Anderson, a student at Southwestern Bible College in San Antonio. Dave was tall and wiry with light brown hair and blue eyes. Wai‘anae Baptist lent him to us when they found out he was a good carpenter and could play basketball. My dad had only been at the mission six months, but he realized his main ministry was to preadolescent boys. They were the only ones who showed up Sunday after Sunday. Even my dad knew they came for the fried chicken and big bowls of potato salad and green beans my mother served on our lanai after the service, but they were polite and sat in the hard folding chairs while my dad talked about God’s mercy and the bonfires of Hell. I think my dad must have been dreaming of roping in the parents through their children.</p>
<p>There were eight to ten who were there every Sunday in their shorts and T-shirts. Malcolm and Rupert Fugigawa lived in a green Quonset hut on Lualualei Homestead Road. Malcolm wore glasses and had a big overbite, so the other kids called him Bunny. Or I thought it was just the kids until I heard his mother call him Bunny when she came to pick him up one Sunday. George Figeroa came with his cousins Norbert and Isaac Melton. They were part Hawaiian, George said. “With some Portugee,” Norbert shouted, “and some <em>haole</em> blood, too.”  Then there were four or five boys from down the road, who were related somehow, nice Japanese boys, who were kind of rowdy and had hair that stuck out all over their heads like a soft black brush. I didn’t count Henry and Gilbert Pauole from next door, because they came with Linda Pauole, who was Gilbert’s mother but not Henry’s. Henry’s mother died in an accident in Waikiki. A drunk man&#8217;s truck had jumped a curb and killed her and a Japanese couple in Hawai’i for their honeymoon. Everyone called Gilbert “Gilly,” because his father was Gilbert Pauole, too.</p>
<p>My younger sister Lulu called them the lost boys, because she was reading Peter Pan in the big set of childhood stories that were part of the encyclopedia my dad had sold at night while he was still in the army before my grandmother died and left him the money to go to seminary. There were ten leather bound volumes with the stories and poems for children. Lulu and I would read the stories to each other at night, not because we liked each other so much, but so our blind sister Francie on her lower bunk could hear the tales of Aladdin and Zeus and all the Greek gods. Even when she didn’t understand them, she loved the wash of words over her. She’d close her eyes and grab her once-blue blanket and rub what was left of the silky border against her cheek. My dad would have said Zeus was pagan, but I liked him more than Jehovah, not that Zeus was in a better mood, but at least he liked girls and let them have some say on Mount Olympus. Athena was the Goddess of Wisdom, and she was born out of the side of Zeus’s head. Lulu said, “I bet that was some headache.” And Venus—well, we were still talking about her thousands of years later. The girls in the Bible were not much, just mothers and harlots, not that I knew what a harlot was exactly, but I knew it was a career path that I wouldn’t be taking.</p>
<p>Lulu loved the lost boys, because she saw herself as Wendy, in charge of a gaggle of dirty monkeys but smarter than any of them and braver than even Peter. Our Wai‘anae boys were a grubby bunch, but they had a wild animal allure that drew Lulu to them like an errant planet or asteroid bent on mayhem. Most of them were from the neighborhood, though David and Dad would take the van out every morning and pick up a family of four brothers from Nanakuli.  The Saveitussi boys were from Samoa. Setu had been in my fifth grade class last year. He was quiet and the oldest, and his brothers did what he said though he didn’t talk. He’d just look at them or say their names, and they’d stop what they were doing, which was usually wrestling with each other. During the school year everyone had to stay after school one week to clean the blackboards and erasers. During my week Setu had stayed behind and done my work for me. He hadn’t said anything, he just stayed and washed the boards and clapped out the erasers in front of the classroom. Miss Shimabukuro didn’t say anything either.  She sat at her desk in her perfect Jackie Kennedy shell and straight skirt. When Setu finished he left without saying a word. After a few minutes I left, too, and walked out to the car where my mother was waiting. We saw Setu walking along Farrington Highway to Nanakuli, which was a couple of miles down the road. When he showed up at Vacation Bible School, I said, “Hi, Setu,” and he nodded his head.</p>
<p>My dad’s idea was to trick the lost boys into coming to Vacation Bible School for two weeks by offering a basketball camp. Dave Anderson had been on his high school team, and they were almost state champions. He had the chance to play college ball, but he got the call from the Lord and decided to go to Southwest Bible College instead.</p>
<p>“Don’t they have a team?” asked Lulu, her voice as sweet as Hawaiian punch.</p>
<p>Everyone knew she was being mean, but David didn’t. “No,” he drawled. “Oh, sometimes I pick up a game with the fellas, but we’re too busy studying the scriptures to play on a regular basis.”</p>
<p>“I think he’s stupid,” said Lulu as we lay in bed that night. Francie was asleep, so we whispered from top bunk to top bunk.</p>
<p>“You think everyone’s stupid,” I said. There was hum at this time of night. The window was between our bunks, and the soft trade winds were blowing through the screens. There was a big plumeria tree right outside our window, and the scent wrapped us like a blanket. We must have made a thousand leis from that tree, our fingers sticky with the poisonous milk that Lulu licked off once just to see if it would really kill you. It didn’t but she had a belly ache that made her sorry for once.</p>
<p>“Well, people are stupid,” she said, snorting. This was something new she was doing, inhaling so fast she sounded like a cross between a pig and someone with a bad cold.</p>
<p>“Would you stop snorting like a pig?” I said, sounding a lot madder than I felt.</p>
<p>“I am a pig, a pig in the camp of lost boys.”</p>
<p>“Stop it.”</p>
<p>“What’s the matter with you? Did you start your period?”</p>
<p>How did she know about periods? She was fifteen months younger than I was. They had only showed us the movie during the spring, and Lulu was in the fourth grade, so I knew she hadn’t seen it. My mother had not breathed one word. I knew that women had babies, but I was as interested in the mechanics as my dad was in picking up the guitar and playing “Hound Dog” like Elvis during the Sunday morning service. Then to find out that I was going to bleed between my legs once a month, I couldn’t believe it. My mother tried to console me.</p>
<p>“Honey, it’s what being a woman is all about.” She was changing Carlos, who was fat and whose penis was wiggling around like some kind of garden worm.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to be a woman then,” I said.</p>
<p>Lulu, who had been eavesdropping, said, “What do you want to be? A boy and have a wiggly cock-a-doodle-do?”</p>
<p>“Louise,” my mother said. “This is a private conversation, if there&#8217;s any such thing in this house.”</p>
<p>Which would be worse—having a penis sticking off the front of your body, shooting out pee or having blood come gushing out of your vagina every month? My dad was always going on about the perfection of God’s design of the world, but if I had designed the world, I think I could have come up with a less sticky solution.  I was almost eleven, and I didn’t want a body. Then Dave Anderson came from San Antonio for six weeks.</p>
<p>I loved to watch him work, shimmying up on the World War II Quonset hut that housed the mission. He wore shorts and a nail apron and no shirt, and as the summer progressed he became browner and browner, losing that opalescent <em>haole</em> sheen. I don&#8217;t know what made me love Dave Anderson. I couldn’t stand it when he opened his mouth and that South Texas twang erupted like lava out of the Hawaiian goddess of the volcano Pele’s volcano. It was worse than my own tweezed accent that I first heard on a tape in Miss Shimabukuro’s fifth grade classroom at Wai‘anae Elementary.</p>
<p>And his conversation was stupid. He and my dad would sit around talking about situational ethics versus rock-solid Biblically inspired morals. And they’d talk about the rapture and the second coming of Jesus, though what was going to be left to come back to was something I couldn’t figure out. They believed that at any minute Jesus was going to come down to earth like an alien invader in a space ship and incinerate everyone who wasn’t saved. The problem with this, in my ten-year-old opinion, was most of the saved were idiots or boring or both, so what did that say about paradise? It was enough to make you want to take your chances as a sinner. Plus, what could be better than Hawai‘i? The beach, the great weather, the flowers, the food–God was going to have to really put himself out to top this.</p>
<p>I really hated it when Dad and Dave started talking about the end of the world. My mom did, too. It’s not that she didn’t believe that it was going to happen. It’s just that as a woman with eight children she was looking forward to the end of each day and couldn’t be bothered with thinking about such a luxury as the actual cataclysmic end of everything. Hope as she might, she had an inkling that the world was not going to end, and she would have to get up the next day and make coffee, pour cereal, wash clothes, iron, scrape shit off bottoms, and make dinner for ten.</p>
<p>I wasn’t the only one in love with Dave. My older brother Johnny had a crush, too. He never said anything, but he hung on every right-wing word that came from Dave’s mouth. That’s unkind. Dave was a nice guy. He must have known I had a crush on him, with my thick glasses and my scraped knees, but he was always sweet. He asked my opinion on everything Hawaiian, as though it really mattered.</p>
<p>I translated the lost boys’ pidgin. I told him how to use “cock-a-roach” as a verb and what they meant when they said, “Hanakokolele” and “That one junk car.”</p>
<p>“Hey, Claire,” he would say. “Ralphie Tengan said, “That’s your <em>kuleana</em>.”</p>
<p>What he had probably said was, “Hey, brah, dat your <em>kuleana</em>.” I explained that he meant it wasn’t Ralphie’s responsibility.</p>
<p>I taught him how to say, “Laters,” instead of “Goodbye,” and what “moke” meant and never to say it in front of one of the tough local boys who were mokes unless you wanted a broke head.</p>
<p>Dave, my dad, and Johnny put up flyers around the neighborhood for Vacation Bible School, featuring a basketball camp with<em> Mainland Star Dave Anderson from San Antonio, Texas</em>. My dad always said San Antone. They wanted to put up a basketball court between our house and the church, but my mom said, “Over my dead body,” because that was the prettiest part of the two acres we lived on with a stand of papayas on one side and three yellow and one dark red plumeria on the other side. So they put the basketball court behind the church. I don’t know where they got the money for the hoops.</p>
<p>Our Vacation Bible School would never be so successful. We had boys from Wai‘anae and Nanakuli, which meant that there weren’t many girls, only the rough tomboys, the girls like Ramona Tengan and Stephanie Kanohi, girls with muscles, who could throw a ball and raise a welt on your arm and leg. Ramona had a crush on Lulu, and I as little as I liked her, because she made fun of the way I threw like a girl, I felt sorry for her, because Lulu treated her like a medieval empress with a vassal slave. Ramona would bring shells for Lulu when she found out she had a collection. Lulu would take them, but she would rub the shell on her shorts as if wiping off Ramona’s cooties. One time I saw Ramona waiting behind Lulu in line for a drink, and she put her pudgy little hand up so that it hovered over Lulu’s blond curls. She was smart enough not to touch Lulu, but the vision of that hand was something I’ll never forget, and the look in Ramona’s eyes, as if all the gold in Fort Knox was glowing in the dusty curls that crowned my sister’s head like a halo.</p>
<p>My mother tried to put something together for the girls, but she had blind Francie and Carlos to take care of, and she was really sick then, throwing up and running a fever. I knew she felt bad, because I could hear her crying at night after dinner when my dad and Johnny were driving Dave back to Hal‘e Aina, the old plantation house behind the Wai‘anae church, where he ate dinner and spent the night. Lulu played with the lost boys and Ramona and Stephanie. I gave up on Vacation Bible School and read or took Francie and Carlos off my mother’s hands, so she could rest.</p>
<p>Johnny always went with Dad to take Dave back. I heard him tell dad that he was going to be a summer missionary just like Dave. That was never going to happen. As soon as Johnny lost his mind and started screaming at the little kids in whatever Vacation Bible School was unlucky enough to get him, it would be all over. Even the Baptists drew the line at psychos.</p>
<p>I  had to hide my love of Dave, because Lulu would have been like the birthday girl at a party with the biggest cake in the world, that&#8217;s how much she would have loved to torment me in front of Dave. She was sly, too. I couldn’t take up for Dave when she said he was stupid, or she’d know I loved him, but I couldn’t bad mouth him either because she’d  tell him the false thing I’d said as though it were true. She figured it out anyway because she took to crawling on Dave’s lap and kissing him. She was nine and still little and cute enough to get away with it. She looked straight at me when she was doing it, so don’t think she didn’t know what she was doing.</p>
<p>Dave was good with the boys. He set up drills in the morning where they ran and practiced shots. Then they’d have a game before lunch. I helped my mother make peanut butter sandwiches for the school, and we’d have fruit punch and cookies for dessert. Then Dave would load the boys into the van and take them to Pokai Bay for a swim.</p>
<p>So every day Francie and I managed to be sitting on the grass beside the big pre-lunch basketball game. I’d tell Francie what was going on, but since she was only three, “Bunny made a shot,” didn’t really connect with her, but she was the one person I could tell how much I loved Dave Anderson, because she didn’t really know what I was saying. She’d just burble, make duck sounds, and say, “Cookie” or “blankie.”</p>
<p>One day at the beginning of July, Francie and I were watching a game, and the team with the girls was beating the other team. Setu and Henry Pauole were the captains. It was the end of the game, and Henry’s team was ahead by six points. Setu had all the lazy boys on his team—Bunny Fugigawa, George Figeroa, Isaac Melton.</p>
<p>“Hustle, Malcom,” Dave was shouting.</p>
<p>“Yeah, Bunny,” shouted his brother, Rupert. “Hustle. We beating you, and we have the girls on our team.” Ramona and Stephanie were better players than most of the boys, and Lulu made up with grit what she lacked in muscle.</p>
<p>“Who are you calling a girl,” shouted Lulu. “We don’t need you on our team.”</p>
<p>Rupert was small, but he wasn’t going to let that go. “If you not one girl, show me your thing.” He was right in Lulu’s face.</p>
<p>Lulu stared him right down and started pulling down her shorts. She was standing there in her panties, when Ramona mowed down Rupert. She was punching his birdlike chest, when Setu, Henry, and Dave pulled her off.</p>
<p>“Put your shorts on, Lulu,” Dave said, but she walked away and left them lying in the red clay of the basketball court.</p>
<p>“Let’s call it a day,” Dave said, and everyone formed a circle for the end-of-the-game prayer.</p>
<p>“Dear Lord, help us to be better sports and watch our tongues. We’re all equal before you. In Jesus’ name we pray. Amen.” He raised his head and opened his eyes. Now let’s shake hands and get some lunch.”</p>
<p>The teams lined up and shook hands and headed to the table outside our lanai for sandwiches and Hawaiian Punch. I was gathering up Francie’s blanket and bunny rabbit, when I saw Ramona pick up Lulu’s little pink shorts. She shook them out and looked at them as if trying to decipher some code. She then folded them and looked up to see me watching her. She walked over and handed them to me without saying a word and trudged along with the other Bible School basketball players.</p>
<p>Vacation Bible School was only supposed to last a couple of weeks, but everyone wanted to keep playing, so Dave and my dad extended it until the end of the first week of August. The last game was on a Friday afternoon. Everyone was there, and some of the boys’ mothers sent cupcakes and nori rolls. We sang “Onward Christian Soldiers” as we rode to Pokai Bay to swim.</p>
<p>Lulu refused to go. She said Ramona tried to drown her one day. I figured she deserved it. Who knows what she said to Ramona?</p>
<p>At the end of the summer, we were at the Wai‘anae church on Sunday for a big end of the summer service. The summer missionaries were going home, and there was going to be a big pot luck lunch after in the Wai‘anae church’s recreation hall.</p>
<p>If you have never been to a Baptist Church then you don’t know about the call. At the end of every service, the preacher calls out to everyone who hasn’t been saved to come to the front and accept Jesus Christ as his personal savior. If you’re already saved but haven’t been putting Jesus first, you can rededicate your life to Jesus or move your membership from one church to another. Reverend Marlowe gave an extra dull sermon that evening. It didn’t matter much anyway, because I was entertaining myself with one of two sagas that filled the two most boring parts of my life: the church sermon and the time between lights out and going to sleep.</p>
<p>In the bedtime saga I starred as a Hawaiian princess, who was a servant of Pele the volcano goddess. Pele was one scary lady with hair that was long and black and had little flames licking around the edges. Most of the time we punished boys or went on underwater adventures in a machine that was right out of Jules Verne.  Pele was a combination of Captain Nemo and Athena with a lot of fires and explosions.</p>
<p>The story I entertained myself with during the sermon was a pioneer saga, in which I was orphaned and had to live on my own in the Dakota wilderness. At first the bears were howling during the night and trying to break down the cabin door. Then I saved one of the baby bears from being eaten by a slavering wolf. I shot the wolf and skinned him, and wore his pelt as a cape sewed on the back of my wool coat so that the wolf head was like a hat on the hood of my cape. I filled a notebook with drawings of that wolf coat, and my friend the baby bear, and the coven of grateful bears, who protected me during the blizzards that swept across the Dakota plains. I knew about hibernation, but wrote it out of my story. Don’t ask me why someone who was living in Hawai’i would want to spend time in a log cabin in the middle of a blizzard fighting off bears and wolves. I think it started after I read <em>The Long Winter</em>, my favorite book in the Laura Ingles Wilder series. She and her family are living in the Dakota territory, and an Indian comes to the local store and says, &#8220;Get ready, haoles, because the next winter is going to be a humdinger. Every seventh year is bad, but this year is seven times seven.&#8221; He didn&#8217;t say &#8220;haoles,&#8221; but if the word fits, use it.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1963 Dave Anderson became my companion in the cabin. We’d fight wolves all day, and then pop corn and sing at night. Dave could play the violin in my dreams, and I was one hell of a piano player, ripping off rousing versions of “Sweet Betsy of Pike” and “She’ll Be Coming ‘Round the Mountain.” Every once in a while there would be a chaste kiss between us, and then we’d go off to our separate beds and wake up the next day to the sounds of wolves snorting outside our door. There was a strict apartheid between the stories. The Pele saga was for bedtime, and the pioneer story was for church. Only the Rapture would have broken down the wall in my mind that separated the two.</p>
<p>That Sunday at the Wai‘anae church, I was shocked out of a scene of Dave’s face lit by the glow of the fireplace in our Dakota cabin. Lulu was punching my leg. Dave had escaped from my cabin and was walking up the aisle.</p>
<p>“I thought he was saved,” said Lulu. She was picking at a scab on her knee and blotting the blood with the hem of her skirt.</p>
<p>I nodded but couldn’t take my eyes off Dave in his pressed madras shirt and chinos walking up the aisle and whispering to Reverend Marlowe. The congregation was singing “Just As I Am,” one of my least favorite hymns, but one they used a lot for the call.</p>
<p>Just as I am without one plea<br />
But that thou gave my life for me<br />
Oh, Lamb of God, I come. I come.</p>
<p>When the verse ended Reverend Marlowe held up his hand for us to stop. The call could go on forever with the minister holding up his fingers for everyone to sing the last verse again or worse to start over and sing all four again. I found myself hating the newly saved because they made the preachers greedy for more. When no one came to the front, the service was over.</p>
<p>“This young man, Dave Anderson, who most of you know as John Salt’s right hand man at the Ka‘ala Mission this summer, has come up to rededicate his life to Jesus. He and John have been praying, and Dave has felt the Lord calling him to be a foreign missionary.”</p>
<p>Dave was smiling as if he’d just won a million dollars.</p>
<p>“John,” said Reverend Marlowe to my father. “You come up here, too, because Dave has told me how your example has given him so much courage to make this decision and open his heart to the Lord.”</p>
<p>My dad bounded up to the front of the room and shook Dave’s hand. This was good news for me, because I could leave that stupid cabin and go with Dave to Africa or the Amazon. Those wolves and bears were beginning to be a dead end for me.</p>
<p>After Dave went back to San Antone, we all had a hard time adjusting. My dad had lost his metaphysical conversationalist. He had just finished seminary a couple of years before, so the philosophical discussions were still burning in his brain. Johnny tried, but he was only thirteen, and my mom was just too worn out with feeding and cleaning to have much of an inclination. My mother said something one night on the lanai when she didn’t know I was listening.</p>
<p>“Do you think it was serious between Dave and Lorna?” she asked my dad.</p>
<p>Dave and Lorna. Dave and Lorna. Lorna had piano legs, big white legs that never got any darker just a ugly red that peeled and turned white again. And her hair—it was turned under in a perfect pageboy and she wore a hairband. I looked down at my legs. They were brown with a dusting of blond hair. I wasn’t as pretty as Lulu, but when I took off my glasses, I wasn’t bad. I’d read about contact lenses, and I knew they would change my life.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” my dad said. “I told him to write her and go see her at Thanksgiving or Christmas. He’s a fine boy. He’ll be able to tell.”</p>
<p>Later when Lulu and I were lying on our top bunks listening to the Chiffons singing &#8220;He&#8217;s So Fine,&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t stop thinking about Dave and Lorna. My mother must have told my grandfather that I wanted a transistor radio, because for my eleventh birthday he send me four five-dollar bills and a little Panasonic radio, which Lulu and I listened to at night. I hung it on a hook between our beds, and we heard all the hits of 1963. Some songs were fun like the Beach Boys &#8220;Surfin&#8217; U.S.A.&#8221; and &#8220;Puff the Magic Dragon.&#8221; But most of the songs were about love, and there were so many things that could go wrong. Lesley Gore sang &#8220;It&#8217;s my party and I&#8217;ll cry if I want to.&#8221; What was love if you could go to a party and have your boyfriend lock eyes with another girl? My mother&#8217;s favorite song was Patti Page&#8217;s &#8220;Tennessee Waltz,&#8221; which was &#8220;It&#8217;s my party&#8221; but in the fifties. Lulu&#8217;s favorite song was &#8220;Walking the Dog&#8221; but I loved &#8220;Up on the Roof.&#8221; I lay on my top bunk and pretended it was the roof in the song. I thought about the tangle of feelings in my chest like a ball of yarn after a cat had chased it. I loved Dave, but I hated him, too, because of Lorna, but also because he wanted to be a missionary. How could love and hate be so close like a good twin and her evil sister?</p>
<p>All summer I had wanted to draw Dave, but I couldn’t because of Lulu. When I showed him my drawings, he even asked me to give him one that I’d done of Carlos sleeping on a blanket under a banana tree. I had really gotten the curve of his cheek and his lashes and his fat baby hands. I had spent most of the money my grandfather sent me on art supplies, paper, and German pencils. My mother had taken Lulu and me into Honolulu one day as a special treat. I didn’t really want to give Dave the drawing, because it was one of the best I’d done. I could have gotten him to sit for me but I was too chicken.</p>
<p>I’d sketched him in secret. When I was sitting with Francie, I took my sketch book sometimes and did quick drawings of the players. I was careful not to draw too many of Dave, because Lulu went through my drawers everyday like it was her part-time job. But he was there with the others. Drawing is a surprise. I never knew which sketch would turn out. I had a great one of Ramona’s calves, big and round as if there were a hard ball under the skin of each leg. There was also one of Setu running up for a shot and one of Henry Pauole dribbling. I thought of putting the drawings in a book and sending it to Dave for Christmas. I could see him in San Antone, opening the package and wondering what it was and then seeing my drawings of the Lost Boys’ Basketball School that also included girls. I’d put in a sketch of the mission and the palm trees and the plumerias.</p>
<p>But if he married Lorna, that was it. I couldn’t love him anymore.</p>
<p>Lorna.</p>
<p>If he married Lorna, for once I’d have to agree with Lulu. And that really hurt.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My stepfather Des got famous, eventually. Fame of a particular stripe—for writing a handful of the most soul-throttling country songs of the seventies and eighties, for a drinking habit so dedicated that it verged on religious solemnity, and for the time my mother left him handcuffed to a tree, alone, for twenty-six hours.</p>
<p>The story of that ordeal was what mattered most. I heard Des tell it over and over—the heat of the day collapsing his throat, the sun moving across the sky, then the moon, then the sun again. At last the bending of sky and trees, ushering the visitation of fearsome beasts, heavenly creatures come to chasten and guide him.</p>
<p>If my mother were within earshot at this point in the story, she’d shrug off all the majesty: “It was the DTs.”</p>
<p>People ate that shit up. The story grew so widespread that sometimes strangers in crowds at the bars he played shouted out requests for the story rather than a song. Des never did write a song about being chained to the tree, or maybe that piece of lore wormed its way into all the songs. There’s no question it crawled deep inside his own notion of the man he was. Everybody who knew him believed they knew how that tree had changed him—how it made him surrender to his true virtuosic gift, which was not music but lying. After he got loose from that tree, they loved to say he worked in lies like oil paints. He offered them to you like a healer restoring your sight. The more he lied, the more innocent he seemed to feel. Anything and everything occasioned a lie—how he got those bruises, where he’d been the past few days, what he ate for dinner, which famous people he’d stumbled into while crossing the desert on foot. He seemed to grow lies like crops. He nurtured and harvested them, so that he could share his bounty with you.</p>
<p>But before the tree, during those first few years, nearly everything he told me checked out. Most often the craziest stuff was the truest. When my mother first brought Des around, he looked to be full of it. During that time, she waited tables at this repulsive south Nashville dive and sang backup for lots of their regular acts. I loved watching her onstage. To me, she stole the whole room, even if she was just singing backup in her short skirts, halter tops, and shiny white boots that came up over her knees. I thought no one else in the world could have boots like those. Then, one of the rare nights I was allowed to come along, she was swaying and clapping behind a Stax-obsessed skinny white guy who came and went after a summer of moneymaking shows. I sat in my usual spot—a small table in the back, wedged between one end of the bar and the ladies room door. I could overhear two other cocktail waitresses gossiping behind the bar. They were laughing at her boots. Nobody wore Go-Go boots anymore, they said, not for years, and what the hell could Marla be thinking. It never occurred to me before that she might not be perfect, might not be everything at once—Wonder Woman, Florence Nightingale, Olivia Newton-John, and anyone else you might ever need.</p>
<p>She met Des while he was playing a string of gigs at that bar. Right off, she invited him over for dinner so he and I could meet. Everything about the apartment we were renting then looked drab and musty. Des lumbered in wearing electric blue—broad-shouldered but skinny, like he was forcing himself, through rough habits of living, into a different shape from the one he was meant to have. He slunk down on the opposite end of the couch from me and asked how old I was. When I said I was almost nine, he told me that when he was almost nine, he lived with Pueblo Indians in New Mexico, wore silver rings on every finger. He said he preached every night as the opening act for his daddy, who’d made a name for himself out west before they moved cross-country when Des was thirteen, chasing the fancier but tougher preaching circuit in Georgia.</p>
<p>“My daddy liked a challenge,” Des said, unfurling his lanky arm across the back of the couch. He was settling in to talk for a long time. “I liked one too, see? So when I hit fifteen, I took off for the ocean. South Carolina. But the swamps got me first. Big swamp forests around the Congaree, thick muck and loblollies. You know what I mean?”</p>
<p>I shook my head No.</p>
<p>“I found work off this old rich dude—a weird dude. He owned these miles of muck. He wanted wooden trails all through it. A boardwalk. Hardest work I ever did, or ever heard of, nearly. I was too young and stupid to know how dangerous that place was. Up to my chest in muck, driving support posts into God knows what down there. But it was beautiful sometimes, when light comes through those loblollies. Beautiful. And horrible. Sometimes you’d drudge up handfuls of muck with something else inside there, too, small and tough, maybe gristly. Like it was living, or trying to. I kept thinking these clumps, clods, whatever they were, grew arms down, down into the lowest muck, maybe into the heart that pumps through the whole swamp, making it live. Or could be, they grew into gnarly beasts and clawed their way up. You know, I saw a beast like that out there. Nothing never scared me more. A hog thing. A wild hog, but not. More. I don’t pretend to know, or understand, but that hog had horns. Not just those big tusk teeth—I mean antlers. A full rack spread wide, like a ten-point buck.”</p>
<p>He gestured with his hands spread outward from his forehead, then paused to search my face. “Sweetie, I know your momma told me, but what’s your name again?”</p>
<p>My real name is Vanessa, but soon enough Des started calling me Nessie, which stuck. The Salty Dog songwriters and sidemen always hanging around him seemed to think my nickname was funny. I didn’t know why until this one guy, a ripe-smelling picker fixated on the supply of good blondes in Montgomery, Alabama, let it slip. Nessie was already a well-known nickname—not short for Vanessa, but instead for the Loch Ness Monster. For a few days, I sulked around Des and avoided talking to him, until he finally wheedled the truth out of me. He grimaced and leaned down close to my face.</p>
<p>Des said, “You think it’s an insult? That beast is a legend. She’s world-famous, and nobody even knows if she’s alive or dead. Christ, it don’t even matter if she’s alive or dead, or ever was. What could be better than that?”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>A year later, Des took us to New Mexico, the place he’d never recovered from loving as a boy. We could live on nothing for a couple of years, he said, and make money off tourists by dealing jewelry. Two painter friends of his had a couple rooms tacked to the side of their studios, where we lived for free. In the dirt yard outside the studios, my mother cooked our food in a beehive-shaped horno, but she never got the hang of it. Watching her fail was how Des and I became friends. From where we peeked at the windows, we’d get tickled while she shoved coals into the back of the adobe oven before putting supper in to cook, muttering curses at that <em>godforsaken hole</em> every time she caught an ember or two on her forearms. Our rooms were heated by a woodstove, which we never lit once. At night, I piled on sweaters and fell asleep to the sounds of Des and my mother through the wall, singing to each other and laughing.</p>
<p>I didn’t go to school in New Mexico. My mother taught me stuff, but Des was the one always sticking books in my hands. “This’ll get you two hundred pages ahead of the unwashed masses. Enjoy.”</p>
<p>Sometimes Des grew impatient with all the things I didn’t know, or else didn’t know how to figure out. Other times, he listened to me intently, convinced that children had everything to teach him. He quoted poets at me, saying kids came <em>trailing clouds of glory</em>. But I could see I had become different from other kids my age. Somewhere I had veered off the path they were on. I didn’t play what they played. I was worlds ahead in reading and history. I knew how to haggle—both sides of the haggle—but I had never heard the term Long Division. The science I knew was the science of myths and monsters, and it was measured in the beats and bars of song.</p>
<p>Afternoons, I would walk along the border of the Pueblo reservation. Sometimes I’d stray off the main road and down rough gravel paths through wide flat stretches of sage-covered land below the mountains. The same three Pueblo boys rode past me on their bikes most days. One of them had a smooth, open face, and he always smiled at me if his friends weren’t looking. One day, as they were riding past me, the wind picked up sharply. The wide black sunhat I wore blew off my head, skidding across the white sage and bee balm. That boy curved away from his friends and rode his bike straight into the desert, chasing after my hat. The hat kept skipping out of his hands just as he reached for it. His friends, who’d stopped up the road a ways, almost fell off their bikes from laughing at him. I wrote my first song about that boy, a terrible song, and I’ve never stopped trying to get it right.</p>
<p>Des always counseled me that if I wanted to write songs, I had to believe that every single thing I imagined I could make happen, for real. If I only answered him back with a glazed-over kid stare, smacking my gum, he might jump to his feet and assume the big bucks pose from his boy preacher days. I could almost see it then, how he must have looked on those revival stages—back arched, head thrown back, ropy neck strained and face skyward, all his ringed fingers wrapped tightly around the mic: “Beli<em>eeee</em>ve! Won’t you, pl<em>eeee</em>ase?” It never failed to crack me up, and if his buddies were around, they’d start yelling out Holiness whoops.</p>
<p>But while they were hooting and laughing, Des might lean down and say to me, almost in a whisper, “See? Even they don’t get it. The one thing you got to believe is the one thing they won’t tell you. Every thing up there”—and he’d tap his finger against my forehead—“every beautiful dream, every monster—all real.”</p>
<p>Not long before our life out west began to fray, Des told me about the Penitentes way out in the deserts—the gruesome lengths to which they’d go during Passion Week. Mostly, those customs had died out long before his time. But Des swore that he saw them once when he was around my age, then eleven or twelve, way out in the arroyo, in the dry yellow dirt, where the sky stayed busy with clouds, thanks to the mountains’ pull. An early thaw had come to the mountains that year. He was thrilled to walk straight into the wilds again, even if the day was blustery and the sun, though hard and bright, couldn’t spare the desert blasts of cold wind. He said that he just happened upon the Penitentes—three men on crosses, half a dozen people knelt below them murmuring prayers into the dust. Two of the men were tied to the crosses with rope, but one man’s hands and feet were driven with nails.</p>
<p>“I thought it was fake until I got closer. But I got scared. A couple men by the crosses saw me. They sized me up like I was a threat, or I thought they did. So I ran. But what did I know, stupid Anglo kid pissing his pants?”</p>
<p>“But I don’t get it,” I said. “Why would they do that to themselves?”</p>
<p>“Belief is a burden, Nessie. You suffer.” He narrowed his brow, gauging my comprehension of his meaning. “That don’t make the burden bad or wrong. Just true. I reckon those men wanted to find out about themselves. Sort out true and false in their belief.”</p>
<p>A belief of some kind did seem to be calling Des out—sacred or profane, I don’t know. He started fucking things up—small fissures and lapses at first, but then a wider rift began to open inside him. He stopped writing. We were selling jewelry itinerantly in town squares, festivals, and beside the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge, where I once fainted from the heat. Des’s trouble started as a dispute with an elderly woman from Taos, another jewelry dealer. They squabbled over a necklace—heavy red coral strands—for which he supposedly paid $400. Nobody believed him, though he claimed he had documentation. He wouldn’t let it go. I could see it embarrassed my mother to hear him rave on and on to the kind ladies who ran jewelry counters all over Taos. They listened to him politely but wouldn’t give him any ground. My mother smoothed things over. Next time around, they wouldn’t do any more business with him. The law got involved. Then came the tense night when Des’s painter friends asked us to move out. They didn’t want to do it and even tried to keep the peace by offering him some good peyote. Des told them they could shove their sell-out visions up their sell-out asses.</p>
<p>Failure quenched something deep inside Des the way success never could. When things were unraveling, his eyes would sparkle again, now that he could start shedding the complications he saw in paid bills, good nights’ sleep, and normal life. While we headed east, I could almost feel the new songs arriving through his fingers as they worried the steering wheel.</p>
<p>Our car broke down when we stopped for lunch by the banks of Lake Eufaula, Oklahoma. The summer was harsh by then, dry and unyielding. The trees were green, but weak looking, and all the grass and undergrowth was wilted and brown.</p>
<p>The lake water was bright red, blood red. I’d never seen a lake look that way. I sat by the bank on a ledge of rock and dipped my feet into the water. Close up, it reminded me of tomato soup. I missed the days before Des, when life was just my mother and I. Late Saturday nights when she got home from the bar, if she’d had a good night of tips, sometimes she woke me up. She’d always say she shouldn’t have, that she should have let me sleep, but I was thrilled. She’d open a can of tomato soup and make grilled cheese. We’d sit close together at the kitchen table, two spoons in the same soup bowl. She’d tell me everything about the acts that had played the bar that night: what they sang and how they looked, and what the bar patrons did in response—whether they nodded their heads in time, got up and danced, or maybe sat quiet and still, glancing away from one another. I looked up from the red lake and tried to bring to mind that vibrant woman, but she was nowhere I could see.</p>
<p>My mother trailed behind Des as he paced the banks. She was squinting into the sun, trying to calm Des by telling him that Eufaula had only turned red from the river silt flowing into it, but that explanation could not console him. All Des could see was a lake of fire. While we waited for the tow truck, he paced back and forth, rubbing his hands against his sides. My mother followed him across the bank. Each time she passed by me, sunlight flashed along new glimpses of her scalp, where her hair had begun to thin.</p>
<p>She was getting older, faster. Loving Des had come with a price—she was paying with her own good years. A new thought broke through me then, that if her years were growing shorter, then so were mine. The time I had left to love her was drying up. I shoved my feet deeper into the murk.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>When we landed back in Tennessee, an hour south of Nashville, I was almost thirteen. We were squatting in a shack on a spread of semi-cleared land owned by one of Des’s friends. Bare acres lay closest to the road, where land was tilled for crops but never planted. Down the dirt drive, you passed another acre or two of thinned out trees and brush littered with abandoned, rusting equipment. Beyond that was the end of the drive, a wide dirt circle where our house stood, surrounded by thick groves of trees.</p>
<p>I went back to school. Every time the bus dropped me off, I walked down the drive, past the empty fields and patches of thin oaks, rusted shovels and buckets. This place looked like civilization had given up halfway through taming the wild. Society had been hard to make, it turned out. I walked past that failed attempt, headed for the darker, rougher place back yonder, knowing that was exactly where we belonged now.</p>
<p>Just before my birthday, Des’s friends welcomed us back with a bonfire in one of the cleared fields. That night was way too hot for a bonfire, but we all sat close to it anyway, guitars strumming, men and women laughing and coughing, and later, a few bottles tossed into the flames. I did what I liked best during nights like those—making myself small in the grass, listening to them, and watching. I knew how good I was at making them forget I was there. They said funny and scary things, always, and I wanted to know everything they knew. That night, I soaked up more stories of failed record deals, wrecked boats, and cocktease waitresses. I listened while lying on my back and staring into the stars. Just as I was so warm and tired that I began to drift off, Des leaned into my line of sight, his grinning face lit by the fire. He plopped onto the grass beside me, his elbows set on his bent knees.</p>
<p>He popped a Budweiser and asked, “What do you want for your birthday?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Thirteen. That’s a holy age. At least it is to some.” I didn’t say anything. He sipped the foam off the top of his can. “Let’s see. You aren’t Jewish. You aren’t a boy. So we can’t bar Mitzvah you. Guess you’d better take this then.”</p>
<p>He offered me his Budweiser. I sat up and took it from him, shocked by how cold the can was in the heat. Before standing up, he locked eyes with me. “Your mom sees this, that’s your problem. Got me?”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>In years to come, the story of my mother chaining Des to the tree would be split in two. The first version, the brash and funny one, he’d perform for other songwriters, onstage to crowds, and to tweak my mother in front of their friends. The second version would only come late at night, over drinks, or when he’d been deep into new songs, hours bent over his guitar and notepad or tape recorder. This would be the version he told his sister Nance, the only family he had left. Every time they saw each other until her death, he’d end up telling her, visiting his memory of the tree in a soft, wondering voice, as if it were the memory of a hometown he’d left for war. This would become the story that held him together.</p>
<p>“Big sister,” I’d overhear him one night when I was a teenager. “I saw things you would not believe. A being of fire came to me, demanded death for life. That’s how she put it. You don’t ignore sacred shit when it comes calling. You think one day she’ll come to collect?”</p>
<p>Nance was no mystic—she was a bookkeeper in Atlanta. She would scold him to quit his worn-out lies and get clean.</p>
<p>But you know how it is, to do that impossible thing he was trying to do, the same thing I’m trying to do now. We can’t just shove our pasts into the front end of a story and expect them to come out golden and crisp. Events seldom rise the way we predict they will. But we go on shoving them into that coal-fired hole. Of course we do. Hunger always comes around again, and no matter how badly we botch the recipe, or how many embers we catch on our arms, we usually do end up eating whatever it is we’ve cooked.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>For three days straight, after the bonfire night, Des talked about nothing but drying out. By the day it happened, he had gone out and borrowed handcuffs from some picker friend of his whose barn was lined with stashes of ammunition and pilfered military gear. Des kept saying he was going to have to chain himself up to get through the DTs. Two whole days, he sat on their bed, one hand on the curved iron bedframe and the other holding a quart of Wild Turkey. He told anyone who came over the story of the Penitentes on their desert crosses. But he couldn’t bring himself to do it. Instead, he started begging her: “Marla, please. Marla, come on. Come on, please.” By the next morning, while my mother tried to shove me out the door to catch the school bus, all his other words were gone. He was simply repeating her name, over and over, as a chant.</p>
<p>I wasn’t there, but I know now the way it went down, or at least this version I believe because my mother and Des both always told it the same way. He’d been pleading with her all morning, but when she said she might need to sleep some in her own bed too, he started talking about the tree. Outside, at the far end of the dirt circle, there was an ancient oak with low branches arcing wide in every direction. Across its broad trunk crisscrossing scars in the bark marked the times Des slammed into the tree with his truck, too drunk to park right.</p>
<p>Around noon, she got fed up hearing him beg. She grabbed him by the hair and tugged him outside and across the drive. With all her strength, she shoved him against the trunk of the tree and grabbed the cuffs from him. She clamped one of his wrists into the cuffs. She flung one arm up to a sturdy enough branch that started at the height of his shoulder. With the cuffs’ chain over the branch, and his other wrist locked up, she backed away from him and stood with her hands on her hips, in the center of the drive, noon sun throwing shadows of leaves across her arms and legs.</p>
<p>She told him, “You want to suffer so much? Go right ahead.” She ran inside to grab her purse and then practically threw herself into the cab of the truck. She hit one pulse of gas, stopping inches away from Des where he was chained against all the scars he’d made in the tree himself. She stopped short and stayed there, refusing to hit reverse until he would look up at her, look her square in the eye. Then she peeled out, raising a cloud of dust behind her. They both swore that he never said a word, never tried to back out.</p>
<p>Years later, my mother would shake her head and say, “I never seen him look so little and helpless.” Then she’d laugh in long, raspy pulls. “I got him bad that time.”</p>
<p>That night I was supposed to sleep at my classmate Sarah’s house. My mother had arranged it on the phone the night before. But when Sarah’s mom drove up in her station wagon outside the school to pick us up, I knew what to do. I gave them both some excuse for my not coming. I made sure to be as polite as possible. I said Ma’am twice. Once the station wagon was out of sight, I un-velcroed my wallet and counted my loose change. I had enough for the public bus, but I’d still have to walk a couple of miles back home. I decided this was worth it. Something was going to happen, something they thought I couldn’t handle. If I could be there, and if I could take it, that would show them they were wrong. I’ll admit now that I also thought Des might die, and I didn’t want to miss that.</p>
<p>When I reached our place, I walked slowly through the cleared fields. I tried to imagine the wet September heat thinning, drying, into the cleaner warmth of desert sun. I tried to make the Pueblo boys ride their bikes out of the pines. But I couldn’t do what Des had always preached. I couldn’t turn this world into something it wasn’t. I ducked into the grove of trees around the house. No one knew I was back, and I was prepared to do my spying right. But I wasn’t prepared to find Des chained to a tree, the truck gone. I dropped behind a felled trunk and took a good look at him.</p>
<p>His body was beginning its revolt. He was sweating profusely. His breath came in heavy drops of his chest. The sun was starting to go down. I wondered whether he was worried about being alone in the dark. I kept expecting my mother to come barreling down the drive any second, but she never did. The night sky came on, a full, rich blue-black, masses of stars surrounding a slivered moon. That sight was beautiful, but even now, I can’t look at a night of bright stars without hearing the sounds that began to come from Des. Delirium was taking him over now, and he was scared by his confusion. I don’t know if he knew where he was. At some point in the night, I couldn’t stand it. I decided I didn’t care if I got caught. I went inside and tried to lie down on my bed. All I could see were the stars, and all I could hear was fear coming from someone I loved. I got up and paced the house, sneaking looks out the window. Finally I forced myself back outside, sitting on the ground with my back propped against a tree, where I stayed until dawn.</p>
<p>I watched him shake. I watched him retch and piss himself. His hands trembled. His clothes were drenched. You might think he would sing to get through it all. He never did, not that I heard. But he did talk. He cursed for a long while, until that lost its usefulness. Then the prayers started up. At least they seemed like prayers—but not to the God of his preaching youth. He was addressing the stuff of his dreams and nightmares.</p>
<p>At first his voice was low and regretful, like the way he sounded when telling my mother he was sorry he’d ruined something she liked. Then, when the volume of his voice started to rise, he spoke of different things—of how hard he had tried, of all that he had done right, of how it must have added up to something. The regret fell away from him then, replaced by certainty, making his voice grow fuller and sharper. By the time the sun had begun to rise—pale pink light spilling over the tops of the trees—he was shouting at a sky full of things I couldn’t see. Shouting exultant praise for beasts with the heads of lions and bodies of crows, for choruses of devils, for the honeyed pussies of angels. At full dawn, under the white morning sun, he finally went hoarse, as he praised endless showers of black stars rushing overhead, trailing across the sky like slicks of oil, like streaks of mascara down my mother’s cheeks.</p>
<p>That was when I saw how hard it had become for him to swallow. His knees were buckling. I couldn’t take it anymore. I slipped into the kitchen and grabbed one of the gallon jugs of water my mother filled night and day from the outdoor tap. I took a couple of deep breaths and walked out into the open for the first time. He looked straight at me, but with no recognition. His eyes were bloodshot, so hollowed and scared that I almost lost my nerve. He wiped his face on his sleeve.</p>
<p>I asked him, “Do you know who I am?”</p>
<p>He shook his head, terrified, and I knew there were no lies between us.</p>
<p>He asked in broken whispers, “Is this the Tree of Life?”</p>
<p>“No,” I said. “It’s a tree they never told you about. It isn’t found in any book.”</p>
<p>His eyes screwed tight and his face twisted with grief. He gestured with his head toward the jug I held. “Can I?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“You stole something from me.” I saw the future stretched out, saw her older and smaller, farther and farther away from me. “Years.”</p>
<p>“What do you want?”</p>
<p>“Death, that’s what.” I held the jug up in front of him. “Death for life.”</p>
<p>He blinked the sweat from his eyes. “Who the fuck?”</p>
<p>“My name is Eufaula. You made me. You wore her out, so I rose up from the fiery lake. You made me come here.”</p>
<p>I never had more nerve than that, not once in my life. My hands never shook—not while I lifted the jug up to let him sip from it, not while I walked away as he bellowed promises for the future, and not while I slipped on my backpack, planted myself out into the trees, and waited. Somehow I knew that my mother would come back soon. When she did, she didn’t say a word to him. She simply unlocked the cuffs and stood back. I wasn’t scared when Des fell to his knees, or when he managed to scramble up again immediately, dive into the truck cab, and squeal off for the liquor store at the state road. When my mother disappeared into the house, I counted off three full minutes. Then I sneaked through the trees, just far enough up the drive, and walked home. I had never lied to her before. She never doubted where I’d been. Instead, she offered me lunch. At the kitchen table, I ate my grilled cheese alone, flushed with a dark new thrill.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Everyone in my parents’ world seemed certain Des would die, that an early wasteful death was the only ending his kind of story would accept. But my mother was the one to go. Something botched past hope, after surgery for cancer. I was away. I spent that summer in L.A., 22 years old, toting around a backpack stuffed with demo tapes nobody liked, including me. I am not a great songwriter or singer. I am an exceptional bartender.</p>
<p>From time to time, Des falls into some deep gulley of his own making. I help him out. The royalty checks are never right, but we can cover most of what he needs. This week, that means eyeglasses, a purchase he has been avoiding for decades. We stand in the empty store while the clerk is in the backroom, retrieving the frames we’d ordered.</p>
<p>I like eyeglass shops, all these displays arranged under warm light. With its plush carpets, curved walls, and endless rows of shelves, this shop is all soft white and glass. When the clerk emerges from the back, I notice how prim she looks in her poufy mauve suit. She’s dressed to complement the room. From where Des and I stand on the far side of the store, I steal a glimpse of us in a mirror. We make a conspicuous pair. Des looks sprung from the clutches of a wasteland, so haggard that he appears singed with ashes. I’m dressed for my Friday night shift—black, some beaten leather, and the red coral bracelets I always wear.</p>
<p>Des sits down at a table lit by a vanity mirror, and the clerk fits his new glasses snug against his face. The frames are huge ovals, the lenses absurdly thick. The glasses look hideous, and I worry he’ll never consent to wear them.</p>
<p>Des turns my direction. His eyes are magnified in the lenses, making him fish-eyed, and my own smile stares back, warped and doubled. Des takes in, for the first time, how I look now. I’ve never seen him look so innocent. I would keep him that way if I could, blinking fresh amazement at the sharpness of the world.</p>
<p>He smacks his hands together and rushes toward the front of the shop. He thumps his fingers against the window and watches the cars passing back and forth outside on the road.</p>
<p>He says, “We keep forgetting it’s real.”</p>
<p>The clerk shoots me a smile soaked with maternal toleration. Times like these, I remember my true age. Fact is, by now I could be the one with the motherly look. But I’m not.</p>
<p>I try to return the woman’s smile. From the window, Des mumbles something about the kaleidoscope goggle business he ran with Dennis Hopper during <em>a brief shining springtime of beforehand</em>. The clerk jumps up and asks “Really?” in a way that means I now have some time to kill.</p>
<p>I step away from them. I need to still a familiar urge—the one that reminds me how much Des needs his story of atonement, and how easily I can snatch it from him. How effortless it would be on a day like this one, with him tottering around a room of glass. But the story is a thing we both hold, a thing to show us who we are. So for now I stand back, and browse the available frames.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The principal leaned across his desk at Jennifer and cleared his throat. He was a small man with small hands, and these hands, she noticed now, were trembling. “It has come to my attention,” he said, “that there have been accusations.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no,” said Jennifer. Her head ached. She’d had too much cheap Australian chardonnay last night and called her third ex-husband in Newark, waking his wife. This was, she knew, shameful behavior for a woman of nearly sixty—or for any age at all, really. Maybe the students had noticed a lingering odor of wine and tears, or a general sense of malaise, or maybe someone had reported that she’d said “Damn” last week when she slammed her finger in her desk. And she’d called that Simpson girl a silly fool—but that was a joke. The girl had laughed. Hadn’t she?</p>
<p>“Of witchcraft, you see,” the principal said. He seemed a little apologetic. “The Darnell twins say they saw you flying through the forest above Wheel Road on their way home from ballet class last night.”</p>
<p>“But I was at home.” This could be confirmed. Her ex-husband’s current wife would remember the phone call, and there was evidence in the trashcan: that empty bottle of penguin wine. She felt herself begin to relax.</p>
<p>The principal, however, did not seem relaxed; he was clenching his teeth in what was probably supposed to be a smile. “Of course, their mother didn’t see a thing. But she was driving, you see. Eyes on the road.” His hands were clasped on his desk, like the children were instructed to do for school portraits.</p>
<p>Jennifer nodded. Her mouth felt dry.</p>
<p>“You will have a chance to defend yourself. But for now.” He unclasped his hands, shrugged. In the five years he’d been principal of the middle school, he had lost his wife to cancer and his parents in a drunk driving accident. He had given eulogies for two seventh graders who slit their wrists in a suicide pact. He was, like the principal before him, a transplant from a northern city, who came to Mississippi either out of optimism or desperation. There had been speculation that he was about to take early retirement and move back to the north. There were rumors of a daughter in jail. And now here was yet another burden thrust upon him. Jennifer felt a twinge of pity for the man. She said, “I’m sure we can sort this out easily enough. Sixth graders are pretty imaginative.”</p>
<p>The principal nodded. “I’m afraid we have to put you on leave, you see. For the rest of the day, and until we get this sorted out. We have a sub coming in after lunch. The hearing is set for tomorrow at two thirty in the conference room.” He cleared his throat, scooted back in his chair and waited for Jennifer to stand, then he thrust out a small, moist, trembling hand for her to shake.</p>
<p>“Please tell the sub that the lesson plan is in the blue binder,” she said. “We’re covering igneous and sedimentary this week.” She thought of the box of rock samples she’d set out last night, drunkenly, on her dining room table: their rough surfaces, their ancient mysteries. She was not going to hand those over to the sub.</p>
<p>“Will do,” said the principal. “Don’t you worry.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Ex-husband number four, Richie, was in the back of his restaurant marrying ketchups when she came in through the side door. She had met him during her brief stint as a part time waitress at the Pig Palace, an upscale barbeque restaurant popular with the graduation and prom crowd. Then, he was a jokey manager; now, he was the owner, and pretty much always in a bad mood. His beard was turning into one of those mountain man-type things, and his belly hung low over his khaki pants, but there was still something appealing about him when he smiled. Their marriage had been marked by anger and betrayal on both sides, but that was almost a decade ago—which was long enough for bygones to be bygones. She hoped.</p>
<p>“You heard any rumors about me?” she asked, when he looked up from the ketchups.</p>
<p>“You mean did I spread any rumors about you,” he said. One of the things she had most loved and most hated about him was his ability to know exactly what she meant whether she said it or not. He looked up, wiped his hand across his nose. “I don’t care what you do, sweetheart, as long as you save some sugar for me.” This was a song he’d written for her when they’d first dated. “But my mother heard you were out at Chili’s until closing on Friday, with some motorcycle dude.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” she said, and blushed. Jake. He didn’t have a motorcycle, but he was bald and had tattoos and wore shiny black boots, so of course Richie’s mother—who had spies everywhere, apparently—would jump to this conclusion. “That was nobody,” she said.</p>
<p>Richie frowned as if he didn’t believe her, then shrugged. “Why ain’t you at school anyway?” She ignored him. He gave the last ketchup one joyous, farty squeeze, then sneezed into his arm crack.</p>
<p>“God bless you,” she said, more sincerely than usual.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Her best friend Theresa, who taught history at the high school, said, “Oh, right, like in Norway.” Jennifer could hear her munching on something on the other end of the line. Or what was it called now? Not a line. There used to be a line, when she was a child—a black phone with a curly-tail cord and a line that traveled for thousands of miles under the earth and the sea.</p>
<p>Yes: Norway rang a distant bell. There was something going on in Norway with witches. Jennifer was bad at keeping up with international news, or any news. It probably wouldn’t help matters that she was Norwegian, distantly, that she’d gone back to her very-Norwegian-sounding maiden name.</p>
<p>“What are they doing in Norway?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Covens, devil proms, bewitched pets, that sort of thing. Husbands wander off in the night and come back covered in soot. Women flying on brooms. Just, you know, a lot of weird shit, and so they’ve started burning them. Hold on a sec, need a swig of water.”</p>
<p>Jennifer waited. There was nothing like silence in a lonely house to make you realize how lonely you were. She could hear the squirrels in the gutters begin their nightly scuffling. She could hear her stomach rumble: she was on her third diet of the year, this one based entirely on fruits and saltines. Wine, she figured, was allowed, because it was fruit. When Theresa came back, Jennifer ventured to ask, “They’ve started burning what, exactly?” and Theresa said, “Witches,” and Jennifer sighed and said, “I thought so.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t worry too much about it,” Theresa said. “They’ll do a background check and you’ll come out all right.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I know. I’m silly to worry. But it’s Box of Rocks week, and I was looking forward to it.” Technically, it was called the Earth Science Unit. After all that studying of atomic particles, she was always happy to teach something solid, something that felt real. After Earth Science they’d get to worm dissection, her least favorite of the units. “We still on for wine night tomorrow?” They met every Wednesday at a café on Main Street to drink wine and complain about their students.</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t know,” said Theresa. “I think I have papers to grade.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>October in Mississippi was humid, the leaves turning golden but clinging to the branches; the grass somehow both parched and moist. College students were still biking down Main Street in their shorts and T-shirts. Her bird feeder was full of fat cardinals and squabbling titmice. She had arrived in Mississippi over thirty years ago with ex-husband number one, who debarked for Minnesota after two years. It still felt like a strange, foreign place—or maybe she just felt like a strange foreigner in it. There were moments when she still couldn’t understand what people were saying, like when she got a flu shot and the nurse kept asking her if she had a favor and Jennifer said, “You want me to do you a favor? I have no idea what you’re talking about,” and the nurse said, in a sharp, nasty voice, “A <em>fever</em>.” Then plunged the needle into Jennifer’s arm with a little too much force.</p>
<p>She drove to the middle school with her windows open, the car full of hot, swampy air. Had they already done a background check on her? To make sure she wasn’t talking to anybody in Norway? But that might not be enough. Maybe they would—or had already—talk to her neighbors, who would no doubt call her aloof, rude. She never answered the door when she saw a kid standing on the porch with a box of candy to sell, or a woman with a clipboard. And had she posted anything stupid on her Twitter account? Had she liked anything on Facebook that she shouldn’t have liked, or not liked something she should have?</p>
<p>The principal was already in the conference room when she arrived at exactly two thirty, as were the Darnell twins, looking bored, and their wide-cheeked mother, and a woman in a blue pantsuit who introduced herself as the school district’s lawyer. The lawyer put her phone in the middle of the table and said, “I’m recording this, if you don’t mind.”</p>
<p>“And what if I do?” Jennifer said, trying for a joke, but it didn’t come out that way, and the proceedings deteriorated from there. The principal took notes in a black spiral notebook as the Darnell twins recounted seeing Jennifer on a broom above them at 8:45 on Monday night.</p>
<p>“Because ballet lets out at 8:30,” said Lorraine, the smallest and most talkative twin. “And then we change our shoes and go outside to wait for Mommy.” She had the long, narrow face of a child who’d been pried from the womb by forceps, her features too close together, her teeth too big for her mouth. Jennifer felt a sudden pang of sympathy for her, always in the shadow of her round-faced sister, Marie, who now smiled sweetly and announced, “I tried to film her but then whoosh, she disappeared.”</p>
<p>In Jennifer’s classroom, the twins sat next to each other in the front row and only rarely had to be separated for giggling. Last week, they had each made hundred percents on the parts of the Earth quiz. Marie had misspelled <em>mantle</em> but Jennifer gave her full credit anyway.</p>
<p>“Even if I <em>could</em> fly through the forest,” Jennifer said, trying unsuccessfully to make eye contact with the twins, “why would that make me automatically a bad person?”</p>
<p>The twins’ mother perked up. “Why not use your car? If you have nothing to hide?”</p>
<p>“But where would I be <em>going</em>?” Jennifer asked, and she realized she actually wanted to know. It had occurred to her that on Monday evening she’d passed out on the sofa, and so maybe—not that she could recall—maybe she <em>had</em> flown on a broom through the forest. Wouldn’t that be more interesting than passing out on the couch?</p>
<p>“Devil’s mass,” said the principal. “Blood sacrifices. Of animals and infants, you see.”</p>
<p>“Everyone knows witches eat children,” said Marie, a little haughtily.</p>
<p>“That’s not something I would do, Marie,” Jennifer said. “Plus, I’m on a diet!” Nobody laughed. Her stomach rumbled, as if testifying on her behalf. “Anyway,” she continued, trying to sound more teacher-like, “the idea of me flying through the air is nonsense. The nature of matter refutes this possibility, and what about the wind resistance required just to keep the broom aloft?”</p>
<p>“And yet we are all made of atoms, are we not?” the principal said, with a tight smile. His brow was sweating. “Energy travels in waves, does it not?”</p>
<p>“The children recorded their observations,” the twins’ mother said, prompting her daughters to pull out their backpacks and rummage through the contents to extract their field notebooks, the ones Jennifer had distributed to the students last week. They had drawn graphs with each inch equaling four feet. “They estimate your flying height at forty-five feet, and your speed at fifty miles per hour, based on the fact that I was driving thirty-five.”</p>
<p>Jennifer frowned. It was somewhat impressive. She pointed to a black line in the center of Marie’s page. “That’s supposed to be me?”</p>
<p>“That’s you,” piped up Lorraine. Her graph was sloppier than her sister’s; she seemed a little ashamed.</p>
<p>“Do you have <em>pets</em>?” the lawyer demanded, pointing at Jennifer with her pen. “Do you have <em>children</em>?”</p>
<p>“I had a cat once,” Jennifer said. She’d had an abortion, between husbands number one and two, but she didn’t mention this. “It lived to be twenty-four. It was practically a world record.”</p>
<p>The lawyer seemed dismayed by this. “Please enter!” she shouted, and a sheepish, stocky bald man pushed open the conference room door and stood there staring. “Hey,” he said to Jennifer. Jake: they’d met when he repaired her brake pads. She’d called him Jake Brake. They’d been on two dates, two! He was fifty-five, with an ex-wife in Wisconsin and two grown sons. They hadn’t even slept together. And so why was he now standing at the head of the table and telling everyone that she had seemed a little pushy, a little desperate, that she had eaten half of the nachos he’d ordered, that she’d had two glasses of wine to his one beer? That she’d told him some of her students were idiots? “I never did,” she lied, but then Richie was suddenly ushered into the room as well, and stood next to Jake. They didn’t look at each other. They didn’t look at her. Richie’s face was red and his nose was chapped. He turned to the lawyer. “She gave me a cold,” he said, and sneezed. “With her witchcraft.”</p>
<p>The lawyer dismissed them. The conference room door wheezed shut. The twins appeared to be texting under the table. “We have other witnesses,” the lawyer said, and Jennifer said, “I imagine you do.”</p>
<p>Ex-husband number one: what would he say about her? That she’d had a temper, smoked some weed. Ex-husband number two had died of cancer in his mid-forties, three years after they’d divorced because of <em>his</em> temper. Then there was ex-husband number three, who’d moved to Newark and sent her a Christmas card every year but never seemed to want to talk on the phone. Maybe she had become increasingly difficult as she got older. Maybe she wasn’t fun-loving Jenny anymore. More and more, everything ached—her knees, her neck—and she tended to cuss loudly when she drove. She had not visited her parents’ graves in years. She was not a terrible person, but she was not a good person, either. This had not particularly bothered her until now.</p>
<p>“We would hate to bring in the police,” the principal was saying, “but it may be necessary. There are tests, you see, that involve ice water and needles and things like that. You should understand how that goes—testing hypotheses and such.” He smiled, then sighed. “It’s going to be a lot of work for everybody.”</p>
<p>Jennifer felt weak with hunger and fury. She had been in this room for over three hours. Her stomach seemed to be eating itself. “If I confess, will that make it easier? Fine, I’m a witch. You’re going to fire me anyway. Don’t dunk me in ice water to see if I float or not. I’ve had swimming lessons since I was five.”</p>
<p>The lawyer made a quick note.</p>
<p>“Can we go?” said Marie Darnell. “We have flute.”</p>
<p>The lawyer clicked off her recording. She nodded at Jennifer. “We’ll be in touch if we need anything else.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>When she was a child in Maryland, Jennifer had irritated her father with her back yard excavations: a bone! An arrowhead! A fossil! A shard of pottery from an ancient civilization! She would burst panting and filthy into the living room, where her father was watching Lawrence Welk. No, Jenny, put that back; stop it, Jenny, that’s where we buried Flowers, remember? That’s just a rock. That’s just a piece of plastic.</p>
<p>But she knew what she knew. The earth was full of secrets. The rock was not just a rock. Her mother was a fossil preserved in amber, a memory of green polyester, pink toe nails, paperclip necklaces made by her students. A snowy car crash just yards from the house. Her father’s choking sobs. The day after her mother’s death, the world was a sheet of ice, and now some of that ice had turned into stones and twinkled in the yard and the driveway.</p>
<p>Well, why not? she thought later, turning over a piece of quartzite in high school geology. The truth was just as unfathomable as anything else. Later, in college, she endured student teaching, she wore her mother’s paper clip necklaces. She didn’t like children, but she didn’t hate them, and sometimes their eyes would actually light up like they were supposed to. Mostly, their eyes stayed dim—in Maryland, in Mississippi, everyone had their own problems, and parents always had something to complain about: Billy didn’t have time to study for his test, Mary’s lab partner scared her, Betsy had a moral objection to dissecting frogs.</p>
<p>But everybody loved Box of Rocks week. Actually, it was two boxes—one containing rocks, one minerals—both made of sturdy oak; their lids locked with tiny gold latches. There were twelve specimens in each box, nestled in their own felt-lined compartments. Sometimes she told the students that she had collected them all herself, rock hunting with her father when she was a child, but this was a lie. Her father didn’t take her rock hunting. She’d found a slick piece of fool’s gold once, hiking in Pennsylvania with husband number one, but she’d tossed it skittering into the trees.</p>
<p>This year, she had decided, she would take the children to the Petrified Forest in Flora to hunt for fossils. The principal had given his blessing; the parental consent forms were stacked on her desk, ready to distribute. But now the town was full of witches, and no one cared about fossils.</p>
<p>She followed the news on her iPad with a mixture of relief and concern. The week after she confessed, four women were accused: the friendly black woman who worked the night shift at the B-Quick, a Mennonite woman who sold banana bread at the farmer’s market, a high school English teacher, a Walmart employee. All denied the accusations, some more loudly than others.</p>
<p>At the police station, a make-shift ice pond was constructed. The Walmart employee drowned and was exonerated, but the others were thrown into jail. Their accusers—middle school and high school girls—gave giddy interviews to the local media, lifting up their tops to reveal bruises where the witches had pinched them in the middle of the night. One girl fell to the ground in convulsions when the female news reporter asked her if she was aware of the seriousness of the charges. The news reporter was jailed the next day.</p>
<p>Jennifer ventured rarely from the house. Sometimes she went to Kroger at three in the morning, when the only customers were other wide-eyed, nervous women, filling their carts with beer and vegetables and microwavable dinners. She spent her days watching television and reading mystery novels and, at night, digging through her yard for more rock samples: granite, shale, a sliver of petrified wood. A gray rabbit slipped into her tomato garden and she trapped it with an Amazon box and then, to her own surprise, skinned it and roasted it over her fire pit. So much for her fruit and cracker diet. She felt her muscles growing strong and taut; under a waxing moon, she leapt up to a magnolia branch and managed two pullups before collapsing to the ground.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>And the girls began to roam the streets in small groups, singing pop songs, stealing clothes from local shops and falling into occasional convulsions. They accused the mothers of the boys they liked; when the boys agreed to go out with them, the convulsions stopped. When the boys broke up with them, the girls twisted and shrieked and said they could see the boys’ mothers flying through the air all around them, pinching and biting. They accused their own mothers, who kicked and cursed as they were tossed into the back of police cars. Jennifer watched the YouTube videos the girls posted, their eyes rolled back to the whites as they danced and flailed outside the houses of their teachers and former babysitters.</p>
<p>But no one came to Jennifer’s house. Even on Halloween, as the girls roamed the streets, breaking windows and stealing cash and electronics from abandoned homes, they left her alone. The town had emptied of men and boys, who escaped with their wives and mothers to the north, or to Alabama or Louisiana. Jennifer stayed in her house, watched from the curtains. A tiny girl stood in the moonlight, crying for her mother, and an older girl grabbed her hand and pulled her roughly down the pavement.</p>
<p>At night, in dreams, Jennifer soared over houses and fields, the cotton fat and white against the thick gray sky. There was no broom, just her body flat against the wind, the air blowing through her teeth.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The B-Quick cashier was the first to burn. Her granddaughters said she’d escaped her cell and flown around their bedrooms, spitting and biting. They said she tried to make them do their homework on a Saturday and chewed all their pencils to nubs.</p>
<p>Then Jennifer’s friend Theresa burned, shaking her fists at the sky and vowing to return as a haunting spirit. Jennifer watched this all on her iPad, videos filmed and uploaded by the accusing girls, who had started their own YouTube channel. She laughed out loud when she saw the footage of Richie’s ninety-year-old mother being hauled down the pavement toward the courthouse. The police and the lawyers had left town, so the older girls served as cop, judge, jury, jailer; they drew straws to see who would get to light the match and toss it onto the pyre.</p>
<p>On Thanksgiving morning, as Jennifer chewed on the leftovers of a rabbit carcass at her dining room table, the doorbell rang. Outside, a shivering woman she almost recognized: oh, yes, the twins’ mother. She was gaunt, her eyes opals. “I’m a witch, too,” she said, when Jennifer opened the door. “Nobody believes me. My children think I’m faking. My husband left town with the school librarian.” She gazed hopefully into Jennifer’s house, hugging herself for warmth. “I was just hoping you would accuse me publicly, since no one else will.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Jennifer, and closed the door. The twins’ mother stayed on the porch for another couple of hours, then disappeared down the street.</p>
<p>November slipped into watery-skied December. The town was nearly deserted; no one remained but girls with their loud laughter and their dancing. The grocery shelves were empty of food, the library and all the books had burned.&nbsp; Jennifer read and re-read her field guides, did her students’ quizzes and worksheets, ate weeds and squirrels and rabbits and roots.</p>
<p>Her ex-husband’s current wife called to say she was worried. Shouldn’t Jennifer get out of that crazy town? Come to Newark, she said. They had witches, too, but the cops just gave them fines—twenty bucks, maybe forty. At the most, it was a misdemeanor. “You can’t teach school here, of course,” she said, “but I can help you find a job as a cleaning woman or maybe a gardener or a night shift convenience clerk.”</p>
<p>Then her ex-husband got on the phone and said they were serious, come stay with them. Jennifer tried not to laugh. The yard was full of animal bones. Move to New Jersey and get a job as a night shift convenience clerk? She said, “I’ll figure something out.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Amazing, wasn’t it, how desire—for talk, for nourishment—could become a solid artifact? She dreamt not just of flying now, but of her own sixth grade self, alone in the yard, the driveway, hunting for something to make her father look up from his television program and love her again. But she was also herself, and all her other selves, the self with husband numbers one through four, and this new self, strong and hardened, all of her layers cemented together. At some point, she realized, her sixtieth birthday had come and gone. In the mirror, her face was all angles and a shock of white eyes and hair and teeth.</p>
<p>She devoured the wilted dandelion weeds. Winter wheat. Sometimes she heard children’s laughter or sobs in the distance and thought of all the things she hadn’t had a chance to teach this year—not just rocks, but the parts of a worm, the frog. We are animals, we are atoms. Hunger and loneliness: who could tell the difference?&nbsp; On a crisp, moon-filled December evening, she went out the front door for the first time in weeks, ventured all the way to the street carrying her box of minerals: quartz, mica, talc, barite, fluorite, calcite, pyrite, gypsum, feldspar, olivine, hematite, apatite. She laid out a trail right to her door. There were so many motherless children crying out for knowledge. All they had to do was look down, follow the glinting path, and she would bring them inside and let them see the Box of Rocks; she would lead them out the back door to the fire pit, offer them food and warmth.&nbsp;<em><br />
</em></p>
<p><em>Of course you can hold them</em>, she would say, clicking open the gold latch of the wooden box. <em>This is sandstone, granite, basalt</em>. She thought of the black lump of iron heavy in their palms. Then she would urge them close to the fire, and closer still, until they could feel what it was like to be right inside the Earth’s molten heart.</p>
