					<description><![CDATA[“Mangoes” is delightfully bitter. There is nothing particularly laboring about any of the words alone, but together the poem exudes an itchy harshness through specific details such as the “Chevrolet’s tires [churning] with dust” and “the three black heads / of [her] family” as they disappear without looking back. The “shattered fruit” and the familiar and unfavorable feeling of “fruit flies [hovering] low” followed by the punchy declaration: “I don’t like Hawaii” similarly convey disturbance and the tense confusion of a child left behind. The use of the present tense effectively brings us into this scene of childhood, abandonment and stinging cuts in our mouths.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This story is tightly tied together. I especially like the details that don’t at first glance have much to do with the progression of the story but in actuality provide information that better builds the world in which the story takes place. For example, the mention of the Mammoth burger that is served at the restaurant where Waylan works and the coinciding comment that it is &quot;really too much meat for one serving&quot; seems trivial but rather contributes to the barren wasteland that comes to represent the narrator&#039;s relationship and life with Waylan. Additionally, the tactile imagery relating to the Badlands, the location of the narrator&#039;s life with Waylan, evokes emptiness and death. The phantom pregnancy, a non-physical manifestation of a loveless relationship, loses significance over time as it never truly existed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like the way the poem contradicts our expectations.  A childhood visit to your grandmother&#039;s in Hawaii--what could be sweeter or more idyllic?  Well, not this one--not this mango.  The sense of estrangement and abandonment are palpable.  The quatrains, imagery and syntax, though unadorned, combine narrative with a cinematic quality.  The ending crystallizes the bitter memory in a powerful way.]]></description>
