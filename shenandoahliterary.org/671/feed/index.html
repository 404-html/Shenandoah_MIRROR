<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In 1986, Washington and Lee University received a bequest of art of the American West from the estate of Stanley A. Kamen, a 1949 Law School alumnus. This collection is on view in the Kamen Gallery of the Lenfest Center, as well as in public spaces throughout the university</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A native of New York, Stan Kamen became one of Hollywood’s most successful agents. In 1950, he joined the legal department of the William Morris Agency, the largest and oldest talent agency in the world, and moved to Los Angeles in 1953. During his 36-year career with William Morris, Kamen became its premier agent, as well as executive vice president with responsibility for worldwide motion picture interests, and a member of the board of directors. Best known for making Steve McQueen into a leading man, Kamen represented noted actors including </span><span class="s2">Barbra Streisand, Warren Beatty, Walter Matthau, Joan Collins and Gregory Peck.</span><span class="s1"> He also helped develop such major films as <i>Sophie’s Choice</i>, <i>The China Syndrome, On Golden Pond, Reds, Bonnie and Clyde</i>, and <i>Midnight Express,</i> among others. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">Kamen was devoted to his family, his alma mater, and the humanitarian causes he served. In 1984, he received the </span><span class="s1">Israel Prime Minister`s Award for his longtime support of that nation. Kamen also provided a trust to Washington and Lee University on behalf of the Lenfest Fine Arts Center project. The Lenfest Theater opened in 1991. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Stan Kamen had a collector’s passion for art of the American West, and he filled his Malibu home and his Beverly Hills office with paintings, prints, and sculpture reflecting his love of horses and the Western landscape. His collection comprises work by noted 19th-century artists, including sculptors Pierre-Jules Mene and Charles Schreyvogel, as well as more contemporary 20th-century artists, including painters and sculptors Michael Coleman, Harry Jackson, Frank McCarthy, and Gordon Phillips. Printmakers represented in the collection include noted Native American artists R. C. Gorman and John Nieto. The collection reflects ideas of American identity, as well as storytelling, mythmaking, and exploration of the American western landscape.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I am not perfectly certain what our forefathers understood by “the pursuit of happiness.” Of the friends whom I’ve asked for an opinion, the majority have taken that phrase to mean the pursuit of self-realization, or of a full humane life. Some darker-minded people, however, have translated “happiness” as a material well-being, or as the freedom to do as you damn please. I can’t adjudicate the matter, but even if the darker-minded people are right, we are entitled to ennoble the phrase and adapt it to the present purpose. I’m going to say a few things about the ways in which poetry might be seen as pursuing happiness. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">There are two main ways of understanding the word “poetry”. We may think of poetry as a self-shaping activity of the whole society, a collective activity by means of which a society creates a vision of itself, arranges its values, or adopts or adapts a culture. It is this sense of “poetry” which we have in Wallace Stevens’s poem, “Men Made Out of Words,” where he says</span></p>
<blockquote><p>The whole race is a poet that writes down<br />
The eccentric propositions of its fate.</p></blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But “poetry” may also mean what we more usually mean by it; it may mean verses written by poets, imaginative compositions which employ a condensed, rhythmic, resonant, and persuasive language. The second kind of poetry is not unconnected with the first; a poem written by a poet is a specific, expert, and tributary form of the general imagined activity. Nevertheless, I should like to begin by considering poetry in the second and restricted sense only, as referring to verse productions written by individuals whose pleasure it is to write them.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Back in the days of white saddle shoes and the gentleman’s grade of C, college undergraduates often found that they had an afternoon to kill. I can remember killing part of one afternoon, with a literary roommate, in composing what we called <i>A Complete List of Everything. </i>We thought of ourselves, I suppose, as continuators of<i> Dada</i>, and our list, as we set it down on the type-writer, amounted to an intentionally crazy and disrelated sequence of nouns. A section of our list might have read like this: Beauty, carburetor, sheepshank, pagoda, absence, chalk, vector, Amarillo, garters, dromedary, Tartarus, tupelo, omelet, caboose, ferrocyanide and so on. As you can imagine, we did not complete our list; we got tired of it. As in random compositions of all kinds – musical, pictorial, or verbal – it was possible to sustain interest for only so long, in the absence of deliberate human meaning. Nevertheless, there had been a genuine impulse underlying our afternoon’s diversion, and I think that it stemmed from a primitive desire that is radical to poetry – the desire to lay claim to as much of the world as possible through uttering the names of things. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This fundamental urge turns up in all reaches of literature, heavy or light. We have it, for example, in the eighteenth chapter of Hugh Lofting’s <i>Story of Doctor Doolittle</i>, a chapter in which all children take particular joy. As you will remember, Doctor Doolittle and his animal friends, on their way back from Africa, come by chance into possession of a pirate ship and find aboard her a little boy who has become separated from his red-haired, suff-taking uncle. The Doctor promises to find the little boy’s lost uncle, wherever he may be, and Jip the dog goes to the bow of the ship to see if he can smell any snuff on the North wind. Jip, it should be said, is a talking dog, and here is what he mutters to himself as he savors the air:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Tar; spanish onions; kerosene oil; wet raincoats; crushed laurel-leaves; rubber burning; lace-curtains being washed – no, my mistake, lace-curtains hanging out to dry; and foxes – hundreds of ‘em…</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">These are the easy smells, Jip says; the strong ones. When he closes his eyes and concentrates on the more delicate odors which the wind is bringing, he has this to report:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Brick, &#8211; old yellow bricks, crumbling with age in a garden-wall; the sweet breath of young cows standing in a mountain-stream; the lead roof of a dove-cote – or perhaps a granary – with the mid-day sun on it; black kid gloves lying in a bureau-drawer of walnut-wood; a dusty road with a horse&#8217;s drinking-trough beneath the sycamores; little mushrooms bursting through rotting leaves…</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A catalogue of that sort pleases us in a number of ways. In the first place, it stimulates that dim and nostalgic thing the olfactory memory, and provokes us to recall the ghosts of various stinks and fragrances. In the second place, such a catalogue makes us feel vicariously alert; we participate in the extraordinary responsiveness of Doctor Doolittle’s dog, and so feel the more alive to things. In the third place, we exult in Jip’s power of instant designation, his ability to pin things down with names as fast as they come. The effect of the passage, in short, is to let us share in an articulate relishing and mastery of phenomena in general.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This is what the cataloguing impulse almost always expresses – a longing to possess the whole world, and to praise it, or at least to feel it. We see this most plainly and perfectly in the Latin canticle <i>Benedicite,</i> <i>omnia opera domini.</i> The first verses of that familiar canticle are:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>O all ye Works of the Lord, bless ye the Lord:<br />
praise him, and magnify him for ever.<br />
O ye Angels of the Lord, bless ye the Lord:<br />
praise him, and magnify him for ever.<br />
O ye Heavens, bless ye the Lord:<br />
praise him, and magnify him for ever.<br />
O ye Waters that be above the firmament, bless<br />
ye the Lord: praise him, and magnify him for ever.</p></blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I needn’t go on to the close, because I am sure that you all know the logic of what follows. All the works of the Lord are called upon in turn – the sun, moon, and stars, the winds and several weathers of the sky, the creatures of earth and sea, and lastly mankind. There is nothing left out. The canticle may not speak of crushed laurel-leaves and sycamores, but it does say more comprehensively, “O all ye Green Things upon the Earth, bless ye the Lord”; it may not speak of foxes and of young cows in a mountain stream, but it does say “O all ye Beasts and Cattle, bless ye the Lord.” What we have in the <i>Benedicite</i> is an exhaustive poetic progress from heaven, down through the spheres of the old cosmology, to earth and man at the center of things – a progress during which the whole hierarchy of creatures cited in terms which, though general, do not seem abstract. It is a poem or song in which heaven and earth are surrounded and captured by words, and embraced by joyous feeling. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It is interesting to compare the strategy of the <i>Benedicite </i>to that of another and more personal poem of catalogue and praise, Gerard Manley Hopkins’s “curtal sonnet” “Pied Beauty”</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Glory be to God for dappled things –<br />
For skies of couple-colour as a brindled cow;<br />
For rose-moles all in stipple upon trout that swim;<br />
Fresh-firecoal chestnut-falls; finches wings;<br />
Landscape plotted and pieced – fold, fallow, and plough;<br />
And all trades, their gear and tackle and trim.<br />
All things counter, original, spare, strange;<br />
Whatever is fickle, freckled (who knows how?)<br />
With swift, slow; sweet, sour; adazzle, dim;<br />
He fathers-forth whose beauty is past change: Praise him.</p></blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As in the old canticle, God is praised first and last; but what lies between is very different. Hopkins does not give us an inventory of the creation; rather he sets out to celebrate one kind of beauty – pied beauty, the beauty of all things which are patchy, particolored, variegated. And in his tally of variegated things there is no hierarchy or other logic: his mind jumps, seemingly at random from the sky to trout to chestnuts to finches, and finally, by way of landscape, to the gear and tackle of the various trades. The poem <i>sets out</i>, then, to give scattered examples of a single class of things; and yet in its final effect this is a poem of universal praise. Why does it work out that way?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It works that way, for one thing, because of the randomness which I have just pointed out; when a catalogue has a random air, when it seems to have been assembled by chance, it implies a vast reservoir of other things which might just as well have been mentioned. In the second place, Hopkins’s poem may begin with dappled things, but when we come to “gear and tackle and trim,” the idea of variegation is far less clean, and seems to be yielding to that of <i>character</i>. When, in the next line, Hopkins thanks God for “All things counter, original, spare, strange,” we feel the poem opening out toward the celebration of the rich and quirky particularity of all things whatever. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The great tug-of-war in Hopkins’s poetry is between his joy in the intense selfhood and <i>whatness</i> of earthly things, and his feeling that all delights must be referred and sacrificed to God. For Whitman, with whom Hopkins felt an uncomfortable affinity, there was no such tension. It is true that Whitman said, “I hear and behold God in every object,” yet the locus of divinity in his poetry is not Heaven but in the mystic soul of the poet, which names all things, draws all things to unity in itself, and hallows all things without distinction. The divinely indiscriminate cataloguing consciousness of Whitman’s poems can consume phenomena in any order and with any emphasis; it acknowledges no protocol; it operates, as Richard Lewis has said, &#8220;in a world…devoid of rank or hierarchy.” In Section V of the “Song of Myself,” Whitman describes an experience of mystic illumination and then gives us these eight remarkable lines:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Swiftly arose and spread around me it be peace and knowledge<br />
that pass all the argument of the earth<br />
And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own,<br />
And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own,<br />
And that all of the men ever born are also my brothers,<br />
and the women my sisters and lovers,<br />
And that a kelson of the creation is love.<br />
And limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields,<br />
And brown ants in the little wells beneath them.<br />
And most scabs of the worm fence, heap’d stones,<br />
elder, mullein and pokeweed.</p></blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">That passage happens to proceed from God to man to nature, but there is nothing hierarchical in its spirit. Quite the contrary. This is the Whitman, “I do not call one greater and one smaller…The insignificant is as big to me as any.” He speaks in the same rapt voice of men and women and moss and pokeweed, and it is clear that he might have spoken to the same purpose of ducks or pebbles or angels. For Whitman, as for the Zen Buddhist, one thing is as good as another, a mouse is sufficient “to stagger sextillions of infidels,” and any part, however small, includes by synecdoche the wonder of the whole.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I could go on to speak of still more list-making poets. I could quote the Rilke of the <i>Duino Elegies</i>, who asks</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Are we perhaps here merely to say, House, Bridge,<br />
Fountain, Gate, Jug, Fruit-tree, Window,<br />
Or column, or Tower…</p></blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In our own immediate date there would be David Jones, Theodore Roethke, and Ruthven Todd in their later work; and indeed there have been poets in all lands and ages who have sought to resume the universe in ordered categories, or to suggest its totality by the causal piling-up of particulars. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But I’ve given enough examples already, and my aim here is not to make a catalogue of poetic catalogues, but to suggest by a few illustrations that the itch to call the roll of things is a major motive in the writing of poetry. Whether or not he composes actual catalogues like Whitman or Hopkins, every poet is driven by a compulsion to designate, and in respect of that drive the poet is not unlike people in general. We all want to be told, for no immediate practical reason, whether a certain column is Ionic or Corinthian, whether that cloud is stratus or cumulus, and what the Spanish word for “grocer” is. If we forget the name of a supporting actor in some film, or the roster of our Supreme Court bench, we are vexed and distracted until we remember, or look it up in some book of reference. If we travel to the tropics for the first time, and find ourselves surrounded not with oaks and maples but with a bristling wall of nameless flora, we hasten to arm ourselves with nature-books and regain our control over the landscape. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The poet is like that, only more so. He is born, it appears, with a stronger-than-usual need for verbal adequacy, and so he is always mustering and reviewing his vocabulary, and forearming excitement of a poet friend when he discovered in a mushroom guide the word <i>duff</i>, which signifies “decaying vegetable matter on the forest floor.” </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He was right to be excited, I think. <i>Duff</i> is a short, precise word which somehow sounds like what it means, and it is a word which poets must often have groped after in vain. My own recent discovery of that kind is the term for the depression in the centre of one’s upper lip. It had annoyed me, on and off, for many years that I had no word for something that was literally under my nose; then at long last I had the sense to inquire a Dentist. He told me that the word is <i>philtrum</i>, deriving from the Green word for “love-potion,” and implying, I should think, that the upper lip is an erogenous zone. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">That sort of word-hunting and word-cherishing may sound frivolous to some, and it must be admitted that the poet’s fascination with words can degenerate into fetishism and the pursuit of the exotic. More often, however, such researches are the necessary, playful groundwork for that serious business of naming which I have been discussing. Not all poets, especially in the present age, can articulate the universe with a <i>Benedicite</i>, or possess it by haphazard mysticism, but every poet is impelled to utter the whole of that world which is real to him, to respond to that world in some spirit, and to draw all its parts toward some coherence. The job is an endless one, because there are always aspects of life which we acknowledge to be real, but have not yet truly accepted. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For an obvious example, one has only to think of those machines which science has bestowed on us, and which Hart Crane said it was the great task of modern poetry to absorb. The iron horse has been with us for a century and a half, and the horseless carriage for eighty-odd years, but it is only in recent decades that <i>train</i> and <i>car </i>have consorted easily, in our verse with <i>hill</i> and <i>ship</i> and <i>hawk</i> and <i>wagon</i> and <i>flower. </i>And indeed there are still readers who think it unpoetic to bring up a pick-up truck into the landscape of a poem. The aeroplane has the aesthetic and moral advantage of resembling a bird and of seeming to aspire, but it took some hard writing in the thirties to install such words as <i>pylon </i>and <i>aerodrome</i> in the lexicon of modern verse. And for all our hard writing since, we have still not arrived at the point where, in Hart Crane’s words, machinery can form “as spontaneous a terminology of poetic reference as the bucolic world of pasture, plow, and barn.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The urge of poetry is not, of course, to whoop it up for the automobile, the plane, the computer, and the space-ship, but only to bring them and their like in to the felt world, where they may be variously taken, and to establish their names in the vocabulary of imagination. One perpetual task of the poet is to produce models of inclusive reaction and to let no word or thing be blackballed by sensibility. That is why I took large pleasure, some years ago, in bringing off a line which convincingly employed the words “reinforced concrete.” And that is why William Carlos Williams, with his insistence on noting and naming the bitterest details of the American urban scene, was such a hero of the modern spirit; he would not wear blinders in Rutherford and Patterson but instead wrote beautifully of peeling billboards, wind-blown paper bags, and broken bottles in the gravel, claiming for poetry a territory which is part of our reality, and needs to be seen and said. For poetry, there is no such thing as no-man’s-land. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The drive to get everything said is not merely a matter of acknowledging and absorbing the physical environment. The poet is also moved to designate human life in all its fullness, and it may be argued, for an extreme example, that the best part of Henry Miller arises from a pure poetic compulsion to refer to certain realities by their real names. Mr. Miller’s best is not very good, actually, and Aretino did it far better some centuries back; but there are passages in the Tropics which are clearly attempting, by means of an exuberant lyricism, to prove that the basic four-letter words are capable of augmenting our literary language without blowing it to pieces. I expressed this view not long ago, when testifying for Mr. Miller at an obscenity trial, and the judge replied only with a slow, sad shaking of the head. But I remain unshaken. I don’t think that Mr. Miller succeeds very often in his aim, partly because the words he champions are what the theater calls bad ensemble players. But as for his aim, I recognize it as genuine and would call it essentially poetic.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Thus far I have been speaking of poetry as an inventory of external reality; now let me speak of poetry as discovery and projection of the self. The notion that art is self-expression, the expression of one’s uniqueness, has provoked and excused a great deal of bad, solipsistic work in this century; nevertheless, the work of every good poet may be seen in one way or another as an exploration and declaration of the self.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In Emily Dickinson, for instance, we have a poet whose most electrifying work is the result of a keen and dogged self-scrutiny. Having spied for a long time on her own psyche, she can report that “Wonder is not precisely knowing,/ And not precisely knowing not.” Or she can produce a little poem like this, about how anguish engrosses the sense of time:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Pain has an element of blank;<br />
It cannot recollect<br />
When it began, or if there were<br />
A day when it was not.<br />
It has no future but itself,<br />
Its infinite realms contain<br />
Its past, enlightened to perceive<br />
New periods of pain.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Those lines are a pure trophy of introspection; they are not the re-phrasing of something known, but the articulation of one person’s intense inward observation. Yet because they are so articulate and so true, they light up both the poet’s psychology and everyone else’s.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Another version of self-discovery is implied in Edwin Muir’s statement that “the task of a poet is to make his imaginative world clear to himself.” What Muir meant was that every poet, owing to his character and early life, has a predisposition to project his sense of things by telling this or that story, by using this or that image or symbol. It may take a poet years to stumble on his destined story or symbol and set it forth, but for Muir they are always vaguely and archetypally there, at the back of the poet’s mind.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When we say of a poet that he has found his subject, or found his voice, we are likely to be thinking about poetry in Muir’s way, as a long struggle to objectify the soul. Marianne Moore sketching her first emblematic animal, Vachel Lindsay first attempting to catch the camp-meeting cadence, Frost first perceiving the symbolic possibilities of a stone wall — at such moments the poet is suddenly in possession of the formula of his feelings, the means of knowing himself and of making that self known. It was at such a moment that Rilke wrote in a letter, “I am a stamp which is about to make its impression.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As I have said, these moments of self-possession can be a long time in coming. Looking back at his early poems, and finding them cloudy and abortive, Yeats sadly wrote in his autobiography, “It is so many years before one can believe enough in what one feels even to know what the feeling is.” It was late in his life that a Scots poet whom I knew, while buckling his belt one morning, heard himself saying the Lord’s Prayer, and concluded that he must be a Christian after all. Or to speak of a deconversion, there were eight years of silence between the clangorous, prophetic early books of Robert Lowell and the publication of&nbsp;<i>Life Studies</i>, in which a flexible worldly voice suddenly speaks, with a whole personality behind it. What happened to Lowell was, in Yeats’s phrase, a “withering into the truth,” and some such process must occur, I think, in the life of every poet.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It is Yeats above all, in the present age, who has preached and embodied the notion that poetry is self-projection; that the poet creates his world “lock, stock, and barrel out of his bitter soul.” “Revelation is from the self,” he said; and though his way of putting it altered, he never ceased to think as he had done in 1893, when he wrote in his book&nbsp;<i>The Celtic Twilight</i>,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">What is literature but the expression of moods by the vehicle of symbol and incident? And are there not moods which need heaven, hell, purgatory and faeryland for their expression, no less than this dilapidated earth?</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">What’s fundamental in poetry, according to that definition, is moods — that is, the poet’s repertory of emotions, his spectrum of attitudes. All else is instrumental; personas, things, actions, and ideas are only means to externalizing the states of the poet’s heart. Before Yeats was through, he had as you know constructed a visionary system full of cycles and interpenetrating gyres which embraced all possible experience, all human types, all ages of man, all ages of history, this world and the next. It was a vision as inclusive as that of the <em>Benedicite,</em> but whereas the latter was for its poet an objective poem, Yeats’s vision is all a deliberate ramification of his subjective life. The phases of the moon, the gong-tormented sea, the peacock’s cry, hunchback and saint, Cuchulain — the ground of their reality is the various and conflicting spirit of the poet. When the young Yeats says</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Before us lies eternity; our souls<br />
Are love, and a continual farewell,</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">and when he later proclaims that “men dance on deathless feet,” he is not expounding the doctrine of reincarnation, but exploiting that idea as a means of expressing his own heart’s insatiable desire for life. The spirits who brought Yeats the substance of his system did not bring him an epitome of external truth; rather they said, “We have come to give you metaphors for poetry.” And when Yeats felt that certain of his expressive fictions were exhausted, he turned for a new start not to the world but to what he called, in a famous line, “the foul rag and bone shop of the heart.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I have said something now about two impulses of poetry — the impulse to name the world, and the impulse to clarify and embody the self. All poets are moved by both, but every poet inclines more to one than to the other, and a way of measuring any poet’s inclination is to search his lines for moments of descriptive power. Description is, of course, an elaborate and enchanted form of naming, and among the great describers of the modern period are Hopkins, or Williams, or Lawrence in his animal-poems, or Marianne Moore, who once described a butterfly as “bobbing away like wreckage on the sea.” And then there is that thunderstorm in a poem of Elizabeth Bishop’s, which moves away, as she tells it,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">in a series<br />
Of small, badly-lit battle scenes,<br />
Each in ‘Another part of the field.’</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Or there is the beautifully realized little sandpiper, in her latest book, who runs “in a state of controlled panic” along a beach which “hisses like fat.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Now, Yeats had his sea-birds too, and in his youthful novel&nbsp;<i>John Sherman</i>&nbsp;there were some puffins very accurately observed; but soon he became concerned, as he said, with “passions that had nothing to do with observation,” and the many birds of his subsequent work are a symbolic aviary of no descriptive interest. Yeats rarely gives us any pictorial pleasure, in birds or in anything else, being little concerned in his naming of things to possess them in their otherness and actuality. Nevertheless he, like all poets, is a namer; and Miss Bishop, for all her descriptive genius, is like all poets a scholar of the heart. It is a matter of proportion only, a matter of one’s imaginative balance.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And having said the word “balance,” I want to offer a last quotation from Yeats, which speaks directly to the question of art and happiness. In a letter to Dorothy Wellesley, written sometime in the ’30s, Yeats said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We are happy when for everything inside us there is a corresponding something outside us.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">That is an observation about life in general, but above all it applies to poetry. We are happy as poets, Yeats says, when our thoughts and feelings have originals or counterparts in the world around us — when there is a perfect conversancy or congruence between self and world. In Yeats’s poetry, the chief symbol for such happiness is the marriage-bed, and his artful lovers Solomon and Sheba, each striving to incarnate the other’s dream, represent the mutual attunement of imagination and reality. Keats’s lovers Madeline and Porphyro, in “The Eve of St. Agnes,” accomplish the same miracle and symbolize the same thing; each, without loss of reality, becomes the other’s vision, and the poem is one solution to Keats’s continuing enquiry into the right balance between vision and everyday experience. Elsewhere he employs or espouses other formulae, as in the poem “To Autumn,” where imagination does not transmute and salvage the world, but rather accepts it in all its transient richness, and celebrates it as it is.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">There is a similar quality of acceptance in Robert Frost’s poems about imaginative happiness, and I am going to read you one called “Hyla Brook.”</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">By June our brook’s run out of song and speed.<br />
Sought for much after that, it will be found<br />
Either to have gone groping underground<br />
(And taken with it all the Hyla Breed<br />
That shouted in the mist a month ago,<br />
Like ghost of sleigh-bells in a ghost of snow) —<br />
Or flourished and come up in jewelweed,<br />
Weak foliage that is blown upon and bent<br />
Even against the way its waters went.<br />
Its bed is left a faded paper sheet<br />
Of dead leaves stuck together by the heat —<br />
A brook to none but who remember long.<br />
This as it will be seen is other far<br />
Than with brooks taken otherwhere in song.<br />
We love the things we love for what they are.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It doesn’t trouble him, Frost says, that the brook on his farm runs dry by June, and becomes a gulley full of dead leaves and jewelweed; it may not be Arethusa or smooth-sliding Mincius; it may not, like Tennyson’s brook, go on forever; but it has real and memorable beauties that meet his desire. Loving it for what it is, the poet does not try to elevate his subject, or metamorphose it, or turn it into pure symbol; it is sufficient that his words be lovingly adequate to the plain truth. In another and comparable poem called “Mowing,” Frost builds towards a similar moral: “The fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows.” One doesn’t think of Wallace Stevens, who so stressed the transforming power of imagination, as having much in common with Frost, and yet Stevens would agree that the best and happiest dreams of the poet are those which involve no denial of the fact. In his poem “Crude Foyer,” Stevens acknowledges that poets are tempted to turn inward and conceive an interior paradise; but that is a false happiness; we can only, he says, be “content, /At last, there, when it turns out to be here.” We cannot be content, we cannot enjoy poetic happiness, until the inner paradise is brought to terms with the world before us, and our vision fuses with the view from the window.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Regardless, then, of subjective bias or of a reverence for fact, poets of all kinds agree that it is the pleasure of the healthy imagination to achieve what Stevens called “ecstatic identities with the weather.” When the sensibility is sufficient to the expression of the world, and when the world, in turn, is answerable to the poet’s mind and heart, then the poet is happy, and can make his reader so.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Now, if I were satisfied with my use of the word&nbsp;<i>world</i>, which I have been saying over and over in an almost liturgical fashion, I might feel that I had come near to the end of my argument. But&nbsp;<i>world</i>, in contemporary usage, is a particularly sneaky and ambiguous term. I see that I must try to use it more precisely, and that once I have done so there will be more to say. What might I mean by&nbsp;<i>world</i>? I might mean what Milton meant when he spoke of “this pendant world”; that is, I might mean the universe. Or I might mean the planet Earth; or I might mean the human societies of Earth, taken together. Or if I defined <i>world</i>&nbsp;by reference to the soul or self, I might mean what a German philosopher called the “Non-Ego,” or what Andrew Wyeth meant when he called one of his paintings “Christina’s World.” I am sure that you have all seen that touching painting of Wyeth’s: it shows us a crippled girl sitting in a field of long grass, and looking off toward a house and barn; her “world” consists of what she can see, and the desolate mood in which she sees it.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Literary critics, nowadays, make continual use of the word&nbsp;<i>world</i>&nbsp;in this last sense. They write of Dylan Thomas’s world of natural process, Conrad Aiken’s world of psychic flux, John Ransom’s gallant and ironic world of the South, or the boy-ish, amorous, and springtime world of e. e. cummings. Any of us could assign a “world,” in this sense, to any poet whose work we know; and in doing so, we would not necessarily be blaming him for any narrowness of scope. Robinson Jeffers on his mountaintop by the Pacific, writing forever of hawks and rocks and of the violent beauty of nature, was not prevented from speaking, through his own symbols and from his own vantage, of God and history and cities and the passions of men and women. Like any good poet of this American century, he found images and symbols which could manifest the moods of his heart, and elected a world of his own through which the greater world could someway be seen and accounted for.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And yet if one thinks back to the Italian fourteenth century, if one thinks of the world of Dante’s imagination, how peripheral and cranky Jeffers seems! Dante’s poetry is the work of one man, who even at this distance remains intensely individual in temper and in style; and yet the world of his great poem was, for his first readers, quite simply the world. This was possible because he was a poet of genius writing from the heart of a full and living culture. He lived and wrote, in Stevens’s phrase, “at the center of a diamond.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I bring up Dante not merely to belabor the present with him, but because there is something which needs to be explained. We are talking of poetry as a mode of pursuing happiness; we live in a century during which America has possessed many poets of great ability; nevertheless, it is no secret that the personal histories of our poets, particularly in the last thirty years, are full of alcoholism, aberration, emotional breakdowns, the drying-up of talent, and suicide. There is no need to learn this from gossip or biography; it is plainly enough set down in the poetry of our day. And it seems to me that the key to all this unhappiness may lie in the obligatory eccentricity, nowadays, of each poet’s world, in the fact that our society has no cultural heart from which to write.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Alberto Moravia, in a recent article on a great American writer and suicide, Ernest Hemingway, describes our country as “a minor, degraded and anti-humanistic culture,” and observes that our typical beginning novelist, lacking any faith in the resources of culture, “confines himself to recounting the story of his youth.” Having done so once successfully, the novelist proceeds for lack of any other subject to do it again and again, and, as Moravia puts it, “mirrors increasingly, in the mechanization of his own work, the mechanization of the society for which he is writing.” I am sorry to say that I cannot brush aside Signor Moravia’s general judgment upon us. I wish that I could.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">One can protest that not all of our novelists are the prisoners of their own early lives, and that most of our poets are cultured in the sense of being well schooled in the literary and artistic tradition. But one cannot deny that in the full sense of the word&nbsp;<i>culture</i>&nbsp;— the sense that has to do with the humane unity of a whole people — our nation is impoverished. We are not an articulate organism, and what most characterizes our life is a disjunction and incoherence aggravated by an intolerable rate of change. It is easy to prophesy against us. Our center of political power, Washington, is a literary and intellectual vacuum, or nearly so; the church, in our country, is broken into hundreds of sorry and provincial sects; colleges of Christian foundation hold classes as usual on Good Friday; our cities bristle like quartz clusters with faceless new buildings of aluminum and glass, bare of symbolic ornament because they have nothing to say; our painters and sculptors despair of achieving any human significance, and descend into the world of fashion to market their Coke-bottles and optical toys; in the name of the public interest, highways are rammed through old townships and wildlife sanctuaries; all other public expenditure is begrudged, while the bulk of the people withdraw from community into an affluent privacy.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I could go on with such sweeping assertions, and soon, no doubt, I would go too far, and would have to admit that anarchy is not confined to America, and that here or there we have the promise of cultural coherence. But I would reluct at making too much of the present boom in education, or the growth of regional theaters and symphony orchestras. Such things may be good in themselves, but they are not the kind of culture I am talking about. Houston has an admirable symphony orchestra, but the nexus of human relations in that city is the credit card, and where art does not arise from and nourish a vital sense of community, it is little more than an incitement to schizophrenia.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The main fact about the American artist, as a good poet said to me the other day, is his feeling of isolation. To Dante, at the other extreme, the world appeared as one vast society, or as a number of intelligibly related societies, actual and spiritual; his&nbsp;<i>Commedia</i>&nbsp;was the embodiment and criticism of a comprehensive notion of things that he shared with his age. Or think, if you will, of the sure sense of social relevance with which Milton embarked on the writing of an epic poem which was to be “exemplary to a nation.” Or think of that certainty of the moral consensus which lies behind the satires of Alexander Pope, and makes possible a wealth of assured nuance. How often, I wonder, has an American poet spoken so confidently from within the culture?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I began by distinguishing two ways of understanding the word&nbsp;<i>poetry</i>: first, as verse compositions written by individuals, and second, as that ensemble of articulate values by means of which a society shapes and affirms itself. It is the natural business of the first kind of poetry to contribute to the second, clarifying, enriching and refreshing it; and where the poet is unable to realize himself as the spokesman and loyal critic of an adequate culture, I think that his art and life are in some measure deprived of satisfaction and meaning.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To be sure, every poet is a citizen of the Republic of Letters, that imaginary society whose members come from every age and literature, and it is part of his happiness to converse, as it were, with the whole of tradition; but it is also his desire to put his gift at the service of the people of his own time and place. And that, as I have been saying, is a happiness not easily come by in contemporary America. It is possible, however isolated one may feel, to write out of one’s private experiences of nature or God or love; but one’s poetry will reflect, in one way or another, the frustration of one’s desire to participate in a corporate myth. In some of our poets, the atomism of American life has led to a poetry without people, or an art of nostalgia for childhood. Elsewhere, we find a confessional poetry in which the disorder and distress of the poet’s life mirrors that cultural disunity to which he, because of his calling, is peculiarly sensitive. When the poet addresses himself directly to our society, these days, it is commonly in a spirit of reproach or even secession, and seldom indeed in a spirit of celebration. I do not hold the poet responsible for that fact.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">At the close of one of his eloquent poems, Archibald MacLeish exhorts the modern poets to “Invent the age! Invent the metaphor!” But it is simply not the business of poets to invent ages, and to fashion cultures singled-handed. It may be that Yeats’s Ireland was in good part Yeats’s own invention, and he may have made some of it stick; but America is too huge a muddle to be arbitrarily envisioned. The two modern poets who tried to put a high-sounding interpretation on our country — Lindsay, whose Michigan Avenue was a street in Heaven, and Crane, whose Brooklyn Bridge leapt toward our spiritual destiny — ended by taking their own lives.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Now, all I wanted to say was that the poet hankers to write in and for a culture, countering its centrifugal development by continually fabricating a common and inclusive language in which all things are connected. But I got carried away by the present difficulty of attaining that happy utility.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Of course I have overstated the matter, and of course there are fortunate exceptions to be pointed out. Robert Frost was strongly aware of the danger that accelerating change might sweep our country bare of all custom and traditional continuity; some of his best poems, like “The Mountain,” are about that threat, and it is significant that he defined the poem as “a momentary stay against confusion.” Frost staved off confusion by taking his stand inside a New England rural culture which, during the height of his career, still possessed a certain vitality, and remains intelligible (if less vital) today. In general I should say that Frost assumed, rather than expounded, the governing ideas and ideals of that culture; but that, after all, is the way of poetry with ideas. It does not think them up; it does not argue them abstractly; what it does is to realize them within that model of felt experience which is a poem, and so reveal their emotional resonance and their capacity for convincing embodiments.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I was looking the other day at what is doubtless the best-loved American poem of this century, Robert Frost’s “Birches,” and it occurred to me that it might be both pertinent and a little unexpected if I finished by quoting it and saying one or two things about it.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When I see birches bend to left and right<br />
Across the lines of straighter darker trees,<br />
I like to think some boy’s been swinging them.<br />
But swinging doesn’t bend them down to stay.<br />
Ice-storms do that. Often you must have seen them<br />
Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning<br />
After a rain. They click upon themselves<br />
As the breeze rises, and turn many-colored<br />
As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.<br />
Soon the sun’s warmth makes them shed crystal shells<br />
Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust —<br />
Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away<br />
You’d think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.<br />
They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,<br />
And they seem not to break; though once they are bowed<br />
So low for long, they never right themselves:<br />
You may see their trunks arching in the woods<br />
Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground<br />
Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair<br />
Before them over their heads to dry in the sun.<br />
But I was going to say when Truth broke in<br />
With all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm<br />
I should prefer to have some boy bend them<br />
As he went out and in to fetch the cows —<br />
Some boy too far from town to learn baseball,<br />
Whose only play was what he found himself,<br />
Summer or winter, and could play alone.<br />
One by one he subdued his father’s trees<br />
By riding them down over and over again<br />
Until he took the stiffness out of them,<br />
And not one but hung limp, not one was left<br />
For him to conquer. He learned all there was<br />
To learn about not launching out too soon<br />
And so not carrying the tree away<br />
Clear to the ground. He always kept his poise<br />
To the top branches, climbing carefully<br />
With the same pains you use to fill a cup<br />
Up to the brim, and even above the brim.<br />
Then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish,<br />
Kicking his way down through the air to the ground.<br />
So was I once myself a swinger of birches.<br />
And so I dream of going back to be.<br />
It’s when I’m weary of considerations,<br />
And life is too much like a pathless wood<br />
Where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs<br />
Broken across it, and one eye is weeping<br />
From a twig’s having lashed across it open.<br />
I’d like to get away from earth awhile<br />
And then come back to it and begin over.<br />
May no fate willfully misunderstand me<br />
And half grant what I wish and snatch me away<br />
Not to return. Earth’s the right place for love:<br />
I don’t know where it’s likely to go better.<br />
I’d like to go by climbing a birch tree,<br />
And climb black branches up a snowwhite trunk<br />
Toward heaven, till the tree could bear no more,<br />
But dipped its top and set me down again.<br />
That would be good both going and coming back.<br />
One could do worse than be a swinger of birches.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To begin with, this poem comes out of the farm and woodland country of northern New England, and everything in it is named in the right language. Moreover, there are moments of brilliant physical realization, as when the breeze “cracks and crazes” the “enamel” of ice-laden birches, or the birch-swinging boy flings out and falls in a perfect kinetic line, “Kicking his way down through the air to the ground.” The poem presents a vivid regional milieu, and then subtly expands its range; naturally, and almost insensibly, the ground and sky of New England are magnified into Heaven and Earth.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Considered as self-projection, “Birches” is an example of how the pentameter can be so counter-pointed as to force the reader to hear a sectional and personal accent. Frost’s talking voice is in the poem, and so too is his manner: the drift of the argument is ostensibly casual or even whimsical, but behind the apparent rambling is a strict intelligence; the language lifts into rhetoric or a diffident lyricism, but promptly returns to the colloquial, sometimes by way of humor. The humor of Frost’s poem is part of its meaning, because humor arises from a sense of human limitations, and that is what Frost is talking about. His poem is a recommendation of limited aspiration, or high-minded earthliness, and the birch incarnates that idea perfectly, being a tree which lets you climb a while toward heaven but then “dips its top and sets you down again.” This is a case in which thought and thing, inside and outside, self and world, admirably correspond.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Because of his colloquialism and his rustic settings, Frost has often been thought of as a non-literary poet. That is a serious error. Frost was lovingly acquainted with poetic literature all the way back to Theocritus, and he was a conscious continuator and modifier of the tradition. Formally, he adapted the traditional meters and conventions to the natural cadence and tenor of New England speech. Then as for content, while he did not echo the poetry of the past so promiscuously as T.S. Eliot, he was always aware of what else had been written on any subject, and often implied as much. In “Hyla Brook,” which I read to you a few minutes ago, Frost makes a parenthetical acknowledgement that other poets — Tennyson, Milton, Theocritus perhaps — have dealt more flatteringly with brooks or streams than he feels the need to do.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In “Birches,” Frost’s reference is more specific, and I am going to re-read a few lines now, in which I ask you to listen for the voice of Shelley:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Often you must have seen them<br />
Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning<br />
After a rain. They click upon themselves<br />
As the breeze rises, and turn many-colored<br />
As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.<br />
Soon the sun’s warmth makes them shed crystal shells<br />
Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust —<br />
Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away<br />
You’d think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Many-colored. Glass. The inner dome of heaven. It would not have been possible for Frost to pack so many echoes of Shelley into six lines and not be aware of it. He is slyly recalling the two most celebrated lines of Shelley’s Adonais:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Life, like a dome of many-colored glass,<br />
Stains the white radiance of eternity.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Such a reminiscence is at the very least a courtesy, a tribute to the beauty of Shelley’s lines. But there is more to it than that. Anyone who lets himself be guided by Frost’s reference, and reads over the latter stanzas of Shelley’s lament for Keats, will find that “Birches,” taken as a whole, is in fact an answer to Shelley’s kind of boundless neo-Platonic aspiration. It would be laborious, here and now, to point out all the pertinent lines in Adonais; suffice it to say that by the close of the poem Keats’s soul has been translated to Eternity, to the eternal fountain of beauty, light and love, and that Shelley, spurning the Earth, is embarking on a one-way upward voyage to the Absolute. The closing stanza goes like this:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The breath whose might I have invoked in song<br />
Descends on me; my spirit’s bark is driven<br />
Far from the shore, far from the trembling throng<br />
Whose sails were never to the tempest given;<br />
The massy earth and spheréd skies are riven!<br />
I am borne darkly, fearfully, afar;<br />
Whilst, burning through the inmost veil of Heaven,<br />
The soul of Adonais, like a star,<br />
Beacons from the abode where the Eternal are.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Frost’s answer to that is, “Earth’s the right place for love.” In his dealings with Shelley’s poem, Frost is doing a number of things. He is for one thing conversing timelessly with a great poem out of the English tradition; he is, for another thing, contending with that poem in favor of another version of spirituality. And in his quarrel with Shelley, Frost is speaking not only for his own temper but for the practical idealism of the New England spirit. Frost’s poem does justice to world, to self, to literary tradition, and to a culture; it is happy in all the ways in which a poem can be happy; and I leave it with you as the best possible kind of answer to the question I have been addressing.&lt;/pre&gt;</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<pre>—divination by auras

It’s Johnny Cash on the little boombox
I carry as we climb the grain silo ladders to get a bird’s eye view
of the town, of our dozen streets,
<em>then the father hen will call his chickens home,</em>

a little eschatology in the early evening—
&amp; you ask, <em>why divinations</em> a moment before

you press your hand to your head:
the town blurring on its edges, I know from past episodes,

like static breaking in, like the ghost chatter of phantom birds
on radar, the green flecks no one could explain
moving against the wind.

And the lights, every light begins to drift closer.
<em>Aura</em>, you say, quietly. A migraine coming.

Like reading the red sky at morning, the sailor’s warning,
or looking for tomorrow
in chicken entrails, tea leaves, casting locks of hair
                                                       when the I Ching goes missing,
as if your body had a handle on the what’s-to-come,
o Cassandra, o Isaiah,

your body somehow tuned to the turning of the days,
the way moths steer by the stars, or animals scatter
                                                     to higher ground
before the tsunami hits.
I never answered your question—it was reading the Inferno,
meeting the doomed one by one, being moved

by the damned, yes, because who amongst us hasn’t dreamed
a passion that would condemn us to a whirlwind
                                               of bodies,
but it was the fortune tellers that shook me—
forced to carry their heads in their hands with their gaze fixed
behind them always.
                       And for what.
Trying to look through the signs into
tomorrow. Who hasn’t looked to the stars

to see if someone’s coming back, who hasn’t seen a body
hovering between this world &amp; next
                                       in the monarch butterflies
rising from milkweed?
You would have laughed,
but all I wanted was to gather them once,
all those condemned sightseers,
because no father hen was coming to take them home.

Are there other windows into the future
your body can look into? Could you look long enough

to see twelve hundred snow geese falling from the sky over Idaho next week?

We begin to climb down, rung by rung, your eyes
closed, slow as Dante down the devil’s back.

Cars shake down Main’s cobblestones. A siren blares
in the distance. You might out-do the MRI,
find the invisible tear in a tendon, tease out

the names from the next round of pink slips.
Get us through the day. Steer us, get us

home, so there would be no pile of flowers in the middle
of the street. No boombox on the sidewalk, playing a loop

of the D.A. reciting charges
against the cops, over &amp; over.

We might know the hands on the litter that will bear us.
We might kiss those hands before we go.</pre>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>Page by page <i>Egg Island Almanac</i>, the Crab Orchard Series in Poetry’s Open Competition winner for 2017, brings to mind a statement by Wendell Berry in <i>Standing by Words</i>, a perspective combining ethics and poetics: “We are speaking where we stand, and we shall stand afterwards in the presence of what we have said.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Cape Cod with its landscape and seascape, its flora and fauna, has been a prime focus of Brendan Galvin’s for decades, and this new volume contributes substantively to the whole—an accretion of wisdom grounded in the provenance of personal and local history. Our attention is freshened and fledged by the prevalence of birds, familiars and rarities, each encounter bearing its special signature. In this collection, Galvin’s eighteenth, marked by an intimacy of perception that never self-inflates or parades, nature shows us our standing among her truths, vistas through language into wonder and mystery. The eventfulness of small—though resonantly large—moments put into words predominates here, the poet’s sensibility taking in data till the inherent pattern and the finished text gain imaginative standing.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One of the largest lessons Galvin has learned across his prolific career is that nature is available to be witnessed in its individuality when perceived with rigor and honesty of language. He knows that revelations lie in getting place and its inherent events down in a manner that brings out the grace and light within phenomena, and, on balance, also the darkness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Man’s problematic relationship to his ecosystems has always been a concern of Galvin’s, arousing wonderment at natural processes as well as satire toward despoilment. That latter focus activates several poems in the book. For instance, what to make of a peacock strutting among the Cape’s wild turkeys in “Out of the Ordinary”?<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Galvin as long-time watcher lays his bet on “some fop’s summer garden, / McMansion and bird abandoned / for Greenwich or Darien.” And in “Labor Day” the permanent residents “are getting their town / and native language back.” The summer people load up and leave—one-percenter Joads—and now sofas are no longer “ambience furnishings.” Through the seasons that structure <i>Egg Island Almanac</i>, poem after poem stands in the presence of what Galvin has said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These poems have come about through habitual alertness to opportunities of time and place and through language tempered and shaped for each engagement with the world as it is. Seamus Heaney in <i>The Redress of Poetry</i> emphasizes poetry’s ability “to place a counter-reality in the scales—a reality which may be only imagined but which nevertheless has weight because it is imagined within the gravitational pull of the actual.” Poetry fulfills its counterweighting duty “as long as the coordinates of the imagined thing correspond to those of the world we live in and endure.” No escape from reality, but the creation of a truth “before which we can know ourselves in a more fully empowered way.” We become citizens of more than one domain.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Galvin draws the reader “within the gravitational pull of the actual” on his home grounds in order to bring resources of imagery, figurative language, tone, sonics, and syntax to bear in a wholistic act of creation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The number of avian species in <i>Egg Island Almanac</i> totals some three dozen. The birds range&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">in size from great blue herons to chickadees. Some are year-round residents at the Cape; others&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">find it a stop on the Atlantic Flyway; yet others get blown in from who knows where—“a godsend from the marvelous” in “Astonishment.” These creatures prompt a diversity of musings within the frame of actuality and imagination. A blizzard in “Limbo” provides the context for a meditation that illustrates how dimensionally one can live by giving reality—predator and prey&#8211;its due through a special kind of attention. Even with their ability to hide, what chance do chickadees and quail stand against red-tailed hawks and coyotes? The poem concludes with a leap of stunning rightness as different worlds come into the same field:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Given what comes from the air<br />
without warning, and out of the marshes,<br />
I know that longevity means nothing<br />
for them, but where are they? All day the souls<br />
of children in Limbo have troubled me,</p>
<p>that savage human neverland<br />
that’s too much theology for a handful<br />
of feathers defending a heartbeat<br />
while this white absence rumbles through.</p></blockquote>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Again and again, to extend curiosity and imaginative empathy to creatures is to have them enter us, the circle closing.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Another aspect of place for deep watchers is local folklore. “Revenant” begins, as do many of Galvin’s most successful meditations, in a seemingly off-hand manner: The speaker was thinking about a chore, weed-whacking, when something dropped onto the top of a dead tree. A fish hawk, prey in its claws. Virtually an apparition now, but before the wholesale use of DDT</span></p>
<blockquote><p>They say a poultryman<br />
might mount a wagon wheel on a pole back then&lt;</p>
<p>so the fish hawk could construct its elaborate nest<br />
up there and drive off any chicken hawks,<br />
saving its young and the farmer’s<br />
which it had no taste for.</p></blockquote>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Indeed, the importance of that last line, its sly wisdom—this is no Disney world.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Galvin’s affinity for gardening has shown itself in numerous poems over the years, and in a 2008 interview for <i>Shenandoah</i> he playfully links it to composition: </span></p>
<blockquote><p>Making a poem can be compared with making compost, it seems to me. In a notebook or<br />
on the pile you take a shred of this, dump a bunch of that, stir it up, come back in a week<br />
and add something else. They both grow by accretion, at least in the poem’s<br />
brainstorming phase when I’m trying to get everything I can possible use down on the<br />
page. Tendrils begin appearing here and there. Volunteers.</p></blockquote>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And so we move to “Volunteers,” from the new collection. Pattypan squashes’ vines</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; have crawled from<br />
the business of forty-eight years’<br />
compost. Survivors of scoop, dump,<br />
toss and drop, they’re escaping<br />
themselves by passing themselves on,<br />
free-range theologians with their<br />
faith in the risen dust.</p></blockquote>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">An observation weighted with worlds in the saying of it. And typical of this poet’s closures, understated and thereby ongoing with suggestions of immensities.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The ability to fashion metaphors that illuminate and not merely shine appears everywhere in Galvin. Witness the thistles of the field and how they activate the poet’s wit in “Sentry.” This botanical commonplace looks like “another / of evolution’s jokes” the poem begins. Then, putting the pedal to the metal, “Still, mixed metaphor,” it looks like someone heavy-handedly freighted it with shaving brushes</span></p>
<blockquote><p>then loaded one of those<br />
salad shooters they<br />
used to hawk on TV<br />
and fired green sickles<br />
and scimitars at you.</p></blockquote>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But what does the poet know from experience in the weight-counterweight relationship Heaney refers to?</span></p>
<blockquote><p>The thistle is a teacher<br />
white and silken, proof<br />
that the pilgrim in us all<br />
must cede his spines<br />
and hackers to endure.</p></blockquote>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Adaptation. A principle to stand by, and given here in plain speech compressed for the poem’s dynamic, a hallmark of Galvin’s poetics.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There is a great deal to admire in <i>Egg Island Almanac.</i> Altogether this is a moving account of&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">venturings and illuminations. Through the interplay of human universals and natural particulars&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">these poems press their claims for attention. Praise to Brendan Galvin for placing his home&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">grounds in such patient, exacting, intuitive regard.</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">&lt;/pre&gt;</span></span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The weekend the Hicks’ had their Bonfire Party, coincidentally, was five days after Grandpa Storms had won Jackpot at Casino, again.</p>
<p>It was Sunday.</p>
<p>We were already well fed from a breakfast that consisted of whiskey-hash and the venison steaks he’d pulled from his brand new utility freezer. It was one of Grandpa’s lifetime dreams to have an enormous store of food that lasted longer than a month, and not just to eat, but to eat well if we’d bottomed out into darkness, again. I remember Grandpa always held up his fork at the kitchen table with a venison steak on the end. ‘Credit is Bullshit. Cash is King,’ he always said.</p>
<p>Along with that utility freezer, with his most recent Jackpot money Grandpa had also bought a camouflage flat-bottom with a fifteen pony engine that was advertised as being able to hide like a cloud to the underwater eyes of trout and steelhead. He bought it from Dekryger Marina. There were pool tables along the showroom floor, and rope, and yellow canoes, life preservers for kids, and deep in the corner that camouflage Mastercraft shining with diamond dust within the carbon fiber. Gerry Dekryger owned the place, an old pal of our family who’d helped clear trees along our river property. But when he’d seen Grandpa fiddling with the throttle body and pressing buttons on the computerized fish finder, he emerged from his office and said, “Hank. You’re my pal, a damn lifelong friend, and you know that you can usually come to me for anything, but don’t make me do this in front of the boy.”</p>
<p>“What are you trying saying?” Grandpa asked.</p>
<p>“Basically,” Gerry said and tapped a non-filter to a gold lighter, “if credit scores were dead dogs, you’d walk out the door with her. But as far as I remember, old Dixie’s been rotting a little too long to be worth a shit.”</p>
<p>Grandpa’s eyes didn’t move from the diamond trim, the traction improved step-sides and the foldaway tackle boxes. Grandpa strolled over to the pool table, and from his coveralls splashed down a wad of hundreds like a firecracker blew in his hand.</p>
<p>“How ‘bout these dead dogs?” Grandpa said.</p>
<p>During that week Grandpa had also paid off twenty years of late fees at the Rent-All, not to mention a nagging bench-warrant for an incident with some pot plants next to the Gerber Factory. When the county deputy asked him how the hell could he dig himself out of a hole that most people died trying to wheedle themselves from, Grandpa said it was his ability to win, to throw all common sense aside at just the right moment which had saved our lives more often than steady paychecks. At Casino Grandpa said his biggest advantage to coming up roses was that he wasn’t superstitious. He didn’t sniff slot machines. He didn’t lick tit for luck, either.</p>
<p>So down the aisles of flashing machines with names like Slot-father and Volcano Gold which stood inside clock-less, air conditioned mega-structures where the disabled sat in wheelchairs with pink visors and mood crystals in their laps, grandpa patrolled in his rabbit coat. He’d pass a few dummy aisles, the Chippewa collection zones, he called them, and then pretty soon, holding the wishbone ends of a peach branch lightly between his fingertips, his elbows would start shaking. He’d fall forward like the spirit of Jesus had walked by and hit him with a towel. He’d close his eyes, herk, jab somebody in the side or in the back of the head before finding an empty stool at a blackjack table, or a machine about to burst while the branch bent clean toward his ankles.</p>
<p>“It’s embarrassing,” my dad said and smoked. We were cruising in the Mastercraft, the bottom scuffing the dirt, and then my dad said, “You don’t even want to be around him with people looking at us like we’re hillbilly dipshits.” He took a long drink from his can of Natural and closed the Mastercraft’s secret compartment. “And there isn’t a single person he won’t tip. Those drink girls that put umbrellas in your cocktails. Those door boys. Old women in pink hats. Then, and this is the funny part, he even tipped one of those Paws-for a-Cause dogs with the blue vests. Gave him a pet and tucked a ten right in his little vest. What the fuck is a dog going to do with ten bucks?”</p>
<p>“Buy dog biscuits,” I said.</p>
<p>“Cute. Thanks, Mark,” my dad said. “You’re a huge help.”</p>
<p>Grandpa gave a funny look like smelling rotten septic. He steered the Mastercraft around a felled log. “Mark? Who the hell’s Mark?” he asked. “The boy’s name is Rocky, now.”</p>
<p>My dad might have been the biggest guy in the county but he had fifteen nicknames and hated every one of them: Big Bill, Honcho, Billy Donut. This is a man who used to be able to carry refrigerators up stairwells like suitcases. Now he was four hundred plus in 57 overalls. He’d gotten even bigger in the calves from getting laid off truck driving where he said his bosses didn’t give a shit if he was hungry. ‘Drive or quit,’ they told him. Only on the boat his shoulder blades were wider than the seat back, and if it wasn’t for Grandpa buying supplies for the party for a counter weight—steaks, six cases of Natural, ice, fireworks, bundles cedar logs, two gallons of Kesslers—with a single step of ‘Big Bill’s’ size fifteen we’d have lost Grandpa’s new boat long before any promises of opening the throttle were kept.</p>
<p>We had to keep the boat in first gear is what I’m saying. No sudden turns while the water crept up the sides and my dad bitched about its fancy seat. “Bastard won’t turn,” he said and kept shifting. We checked ours. They spun like swivels. Grandpa leaned forward and inspected the reinforced steel post underneath Big Bill. “Good God,” Grandpa said. “You’ve sheared off the swirly-do. That seat’s got your name on it, now. Actually, just so you don’t ruin the others, I’ll write your name on the bastard.” Grandpa took a marker from his tackle box, cut the engine, the boat floated rotila style underneath willow branches and in big letters he wrote, “Big Boy,” on the new leather.</p>
<p>“Biddy Boy,” Uncle Rick said and drank.</p>
<p>“Watch it,” my dad said.</p>
<p>The motor bogged through the shallows. Uncle Rick sat in the opposite, but still swiveling bucket seat. He’d had a few jobs in different states. Hated it when bosses wouldn’t give him time off and, as he said, did little accounting riddles with his paychecks. What can I say?  Uncle Rick was living with us, again.</p>
<p>As we moved upstream I had my pellet gun and was shooting empty beer cans floating in the water. I popped one. A flock of birds flew from a willow and swirled like smoke. That’s when Grandpa dug inside the groceries and yanked out a Kesslers. “You know the trick to winning the Jackpot?” he asked and inspected the bottle. “The trick to winning at life?”</p>
<p>“Money,” my dad said. “Work.”</p>
<p>“Supreme confidence,” Grandpa said. “You gotta know you’re the winner above all those other poor folk. Tell it on the mountain if you have to. ‘I’m the winner,’ say. ‘I’m gonna find a trillion dollars with my divinin’ stick,’ say. Know it like you know you’re the toughest kid in the county.” He took another drink. “Ain’t that right, Rocky?”</p>
<p>I shrugged, kept searching for cans floating near the shores. I couldn’t shoot any because most of them were still inside the hands of tubers, actual human beings as they floated from the bridge to Maple Island wedged inside rubber tubes. Uncle Rick raised a can at them: the international sign for peace on earth.</p>
<p>“Member when Rocky knocked the hell out of that mugger bugger?” Grandpa said. “Pop! Out cold as February. I think they put your name in the paper on that one. I mean, I didn’t see the paper so don’t get your hopes up. But I’ve been telling that story all year. I’ll tell it every year. What’s her name? That clerk girl you saved.”</p>
<p>“Angel,” Uncle Rick said and threw a can in the compartment.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Pretty little Angel,” Grandpa said.</p>
<p>So I’d walked into Ashcroft’s Gas and Grocery a month earlier. So, while I was standing there about to buy some deer jerky, I hear, ‘put the money in the bag, bitch.’ It’s not that I knew what to do. Whenever Grandpa told me to cut wood or dig a hole for deer guts I did what I was told. I guess those muscles came in handy for once.</p>
<p>“Bullshit. He didn’t save that place of fifty cents,” my dad said. “Bastard kid held up the girl with a squirt gun.” My dad gave me a flat look with his chin tucked near his chest. I watched the shore, the dead ash trees like bones and wished his chair swiveled. I mean, this is a man, when he ate ice-cream, his entire hand engulfed the half gallon.  His eyes didn’t move as he said, “Only now we have to get him working, again.”</p>
<p>“Naw. We’ll get him fightin’,” Grandpa said. “Them octagon or pentagram fights. King of the Cage. That’ll be Rocky in what?” He flipped a finger toward Uncle Rick. “Five years, ya say? Then we’ll see who the badass of the family is. Some guy named BoneCrusher will knock him square in the lips and he’ll get paid for it. We’ll eat for three years. ‘Bonecrusher money’, we’ll call it.” Grandpa made a fist, punched his palm and yipped. “Pay the Man!!”</p>
<p>I spun the pellet gun between my feet, smiled because I liked hearing that somewhere in the future I might get paid for once. I’d be the one that helped for once. Where other people would’ve been scared I’d have the guts for once. Maybe it was a million bullies I was fighting, but when the bastard held the gun on Angel Rojas shaking from nerves, skinny from hunger, it was like water crept toward my heart and the pressure dove straight toward my fist like spontaneous human combustions.</p>
<p>‘Holy shit,’ Angel had said. ‘Wait, wait. Hold him there, Mark. I’ll call my cousins. Wait. No. The cops! We’re all legal on this, I think.’</p>
<p>Sticks of venison jerky littered the floor and I may have piddled. Only my dad wouldn’t stop staring at me from his newly broken seat. “If he don’t quit first,” he said, because, in our world, the largest sin a person could commit was quitting. Hungry? Keep working. Tired? Fingers raw?  Is the company docking your paycheck? Go to work or be fired.</p>
<p>“Baaa,” Grandpa said. “We’re tired of this talk.”</p>
<p>“No. Really,” my dad said. “You want to call him Rocky, now. Let’s talk about that nickname a second.”</p>
<p>“Don’t listen to this, Rocky,” Grandpa said. “It’s his own bullshit he can’t quite put a finger on.”</p>
<p>Underwater I could see the dark outlines of Salmon as they shot toward the banks from our passing. “Where’d you work last month, Mark?” my dad asked me.</p>
<p>“The Shack,” I said. “The resort with those log cabins. It’s not like everyone doesn’t know.”</p>
<p>“You worked for those bastards?” Uncle Rick said.</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>“Dishwashing right?” my dad asked me.</p>
<p>I didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>“Right,” my dad said. “So Mark gets this dishwashing job, right. Decent job. Not great. But decent for guys like us.”</p>
<p>“Sure,” Uncle Rick said. “Right where they like to keep us. With their boots on our necks.”</p>
<p>“The kid’s fourteen,” my dad said.</p>
<p>Uncle Rick mumbled and drank.</p>
<p>“Anyway, listen,” my dad said. “The thing is he’s got this boss. Guy’s got some kind of social problem. A real piece of love, this guy. What can I say? A bully. He bullied him. What did you say he said, Mark?”</p>
<p>“Rocky,” Grandpa said. “His name’s Rocky.”</p>
<p>“Fine. Rocky. Let’s get this out in the open, Rock.”</p>
<p>I kept watching people in their inner tubes, hooking their feet underneath coolers and thinking about how, a couple hours from then, they’d be in their cars, driving from the boat launches and back toward the city. “I don’t know,” I said. “He told me to shut up and stuff. Said I was stupid for not carrying glasses right or whatever…”</p>
<p>“That ain’t what you told me. C’mon, Rock. Let’s get honest here.”</p>
<p>“…‘sit,” I said.</p>
<p>“That ain’t it. Fine. I’ll tell it for you, then.” My dad found a way to spin his legs around toward the middle of the boat where both heels were now splayed over the carpet toward Uncle Rick. The boat leaned. Grandpa stepped left to keep her even. “So Rocky is carrying wine bottles. And this pecker wood of a boss pulls him aside every once in a while. He’s a real tall fucker, I guess. Liked to use that to his advantage. Usual stuff. Anyway, he gets Rocky aside and he says, ‘I know you eat at Sizzler a lot, but this is how you carry two wine bottles.’ He insults him by saying other shit, too. Like asking him if he knows what water is. Normal employee relations over there. But that one about the wine bottles should have been it.” My dad leaned over, grunted, took up a can and cracked it open. “But instead of keeping his face to the iron, Mark quits. Doesn’t do nothin’. Just quits.”</p>
<p>“What’s he supposed to do?” Uncle Rick said. “Either way he’s saved a girl.”</p>
<p>“All’s I’m saying is that, Rocky, if you’re going to call him that, you have to know the whole story. Especially if he ain’t workin’.”</p>
<p>“Either way is right,” Grandpa said to my dad. “Big Boy. I don’t care if you’re out of work or playing pixie stix, we ain’t bring that negativity shit with us, today. His name is Rocky and we’re winning. That’s the name of this day. This is winner day.”</p>
<p>From both shores of the river, the green banks with willows letting down their hair or the cliffs where the earth looked like it ripped in half from sheared sand and glaciers, smoke plumed from fire-pits. You could smell barbecue and rotten meat, something somebody in the city probably would eat with vinegar in the back of a bus.</p>
<p>“Jesus,” my dad said about it. “I’m losing my appetite.”</p>
<p>“Possum,” Uncle Rick said. “The other dark meat.”</p>
<p>“Get your mind off it,” Grandpa said.</p>
<p>We trolled upstream. With a little tooth whistle Grandpa Storms ushered Rick to take the wheel while he checked the pockets of his rabbit coat. Then he weaseled inside the secret compartments and under grocery bags.</p>
<p>“Get your mind off it,” Grandpa said, again. “And set your mind on these apples.” From a plastic bag he pulled out a stack of cash as tall as my hand was wide. Grandpa smelled it and snickered. He handed it over to Uncle Rick for a sniff while my dad jerked to turn around. He gave up when the bucket seat snapped down three more inches.</p>
<p>“The hell they doing back there?” he asked me.</p>
<p>Behind his back Grandpa Storms held a fist to his eye and his other palm against the side of his face.</p>
<p>“Drinking,” I said.</p>
<p>Uncle rick slowed, weaved the boat between people floating along on inner tubes.</p>
<p>“Listen up,” Grandpa said, which meant we knew there were rules coming. Like the time he told us not to turn on the headlights when pulling into private property, or the time we had to rub dirt on our clothes and faces before walking into the county court.</p>
<p>“We’re going to win,” Grandpa said. “That’s all that needs to be in your mind. Rick,” he said and slapped my uncle. “You’re on horseshoes. Bet big in the beginning to scare the chickens. And Big Boy. You’re on hatchet throwing. On your last toss bet the house to rattle their nerves. And Rocky?” He scratched his head. “I’ll figure it out. But you’re my ringer man.”</p>
<p>“What about you?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I’m on everything else. But there is one rule that matters above all the others.”</p>
<p>“Here we go,” Dad said.</p>
<p>“Believe,” Grandpa said. “Above all else.” He drank and lost his train of thought. “Less negativity and more positivity. And know you’re going to survive. And win,” he said. “And win and win. Until they’re naked on the ground giving you their last quarter. That’s your job. Got it?”</p>
<p>“Got it,” I said.</p>
<p>“And one more thing. If you get scared. If your little tiptoes start to quake and you think we’re going to be eating possum for another year, give your money to Rocky. He’ll take care of us.”</p>
<p>As we emerged from the shadow of the Bridgeton Bridge we heard the noises of river people. Horseshoes clanged iron stakes. The heads of axes thunked into Maplewood. The squeaks of metal folding chairs and the sounds of a hundred beer cans shuffling through ice and plastic told the world on two banks the party had started. We put the cash into our coats. We docked. We smelled sizzling pig, the warmth of cheese potatoes and cinnamon corn wrapped in foil. Like we did every year we came as a family, but when the old man arrived, from the fire-pit to the rope-swing people yelled Grandpa’s name as he strolled up with his rabbit coat bristling the wind. ‘Hank. Did you bring your divining stick?” Or, “Damn, how many Storms boys can fit into one boat?” “Hank, where the hell’s Biddy Boy?” The crowd grew quiet as my dad lurched over the hill half limping. “Jesus,” someone said. “Bill got big.”</p>
<p>Grandpa Storms shook hands like running for office. “We’re here to slow the economy,” he said.</p>
<p>The crowd of flannel shirts and dirty denim laughed. “What’s that you believin’ in?” someone yelled from the porch.</p>
<p>“I do believe,” Grandpa said and tightened his coat, “I do believe I have the fever.” And like a sword from his pant-leg out came the divining stick. Little boys pumped their fists and middle aged women in waders flapped their hands at the air. But Grandpa set to work. He closed his eyes, breathed deep, and with a quarter turn over the fire-pit, he stopped short. His elbows shook. The tip of the wishbone pointed near the horseshoe stakes, ‘the pits’ they called them, and bent downward where Jay Hicks, the owner of this property, stood with a tongue against his tooth, arms held high showing the world how to fit a fresh can into a beer koozie.</p>
<p>“Rick,” Grandpa said and shivered. “Quickly. I’m feeling faint.”</p>
<p>Uncle Rick took position and shook hands with Jay.</p>
<p>Grandpa moved on. Bodies cleared a path around the Euchre table, the Polish Ring Toss and the Ladder Bags. “Are you there, Big Boy,” Grandpa said. “Give me your energy.”</p>
<p>My dad hadn’t moved. He still leaned heavy against the porch from the climb up the bank. “Ya. I’ve been here,” he said.</p>
<p>Grandpa stepped toward a Maple tree where three hatchets were stuck. The bunny fur of Grandpa’s coat stood on end as he wobbled and caught himself by opening his eyes. “I see a fifty score in your future, Biddy. Maybe eighty.”</p>
<p>At the head of the cabin the shudder doors were opened wide where concessions were served, pig meat and pound cakes and three for a dollar colas and gambling stubs in increments of five to one hundred. Enormous white coolers were strewn along the planks with packages of ice and burger buns. Grandpa tripped over those. “Easy, Hank. The games are back this way,” Lisa Parks said, and then led him down the stairs where he brushed my father’s face with his elbow, shifted left, and then right, until stumbling and knocking over the Euchre table. I grabbed him by the arms and helped him sit. That’s where he dug a pint of whiskey from his coat pocket.</p>
<p>“Rocky,” he yelled and slapped the card table. Everyone from the DJ near the river to the barbecue girls walking around taking tickets shut up and listened.</p>
<p>“Right here, Grandpa,” I said.</p>
<p>“Kill a few hours,” he said. He took a drink. “Call ya when I need ya.”</p>
<p>The music started again. A few moments later at the concession Uncle Rick did the work procuring betting slips, handing the stacks to Angel Rojas who stood indoors near the Hicks’ kitchen stove. She had a visor hat on, and even though she only worked at Ashcrofts three nights a week, most people thought it was nice the Hicks’ barbecue carnival was good way for her to earn a few extra. Kids chased each other around a dunking pool and its rope dangling over the water. I noticed a few people I worked with where I quit washing dishes: Earl Ashbaugh and Jeremy Hicks around the outhouses puffing a pipe. The horseshoes clanged. Ping pong balls plopped into beer cups. “Fifty,” someone yelled. “Make that seventy five.” The ticket kids set to running.</p>
<p>I strolled along, waiting for my turn, so I went over to the stakes where Uncle Rick had already gotten started.</p>
<p>Dave Burkle, the mechanic who’d given us a deal on a transmission for our four by four stood at the opposite end in his jean coat. “Alaska?” he asked Uncle Rick. “How’d you find yourself way up there?”</p>
<p>“Guy in Colorado said they needed welders. And I needed money.”</p>
<p>“Find any?”</p>
<p>Uncle Rick mumbled. “I’m here, aren’t I?”</p>
<p>Dave Burkle held one eye closed, sized up the stake through the open end of the horseshoe. He threw. The iron flipped twice and it landed perfect. “Ringer. Fifty,” he yelled.</p>
<p>Uncle Rick swore. He slapped another four tickets on the tree stump.</p>
<p>“You’re going to win,” I told him. “Believe it, man.”</p>
<p>“You wanna try?” he asked.</p>
<p>I threw up my hands. “It ain’t my turn,” I said.</p>
<p>He mumbled something, stepped forward and threw. The horseshoe spun midair; sand puffed as it landed. “Nothin,” Dave Burkle said. “Twenty me.” A ticket girl, no more than ten years old with a change belt, snatched a ticket from the stump and walked it over from our side to his.</p>
<p>“Believe,” I said.</p>
<p>“Shut it,” he said.</p>
<p>I left Uncle Rick to the business because it turns out people in bad moods can rarely be saved. I passed the rope circles, ducked around lawn darts and looped around the blanket run. I went over to where the Vincents were bouncing quarters from a refrigerator door and into plastic cups. The Vincent kids collected pennies all year for this single game, walked ditches and plucked empty beer bottles from the side of the road. It was all the money they’d had and wanted to double it wisely. I set down a ticket, ten bucks worth, and in three tosses lost triple that.</p>
<p>Grandpa watched from the Euchre table. “Get out of it, Rock,” he said. “You can’t scare people with nothing to lose. Those Vincents are devils.”</p>
<p>A band started, some copy-cat band that could play for three hours straight with steel drums and smokes and headbands like the motion of plucking the strings was a thirty minute song all its own. I finally went over to where my dad was throwing axes. He sweated like the only man in a thunderstorm. His pants were wet in odd places. He kept pulling a handkerchief from his back pocket and wiping his glasses and neck.</p>
<p>“Good God,” I said “Have you got it in you?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” he said. “I think my ankle’s acting up, again. Or it’s this damn diabeetus. I might need to eat something.” He stuffed the handkerchief back into his pocket. The score looked bad, 80 to 3, and a kid sucking a fruit box kept walking over and handing him hatchets from the dirt. Our Cousin Lou stood against him, our blood relation, a person might think would be on our side when things turned for the worse. But Lou lived on the opposite side of the river, went to the Ratskellar bar instead of the 7 Mile and liked herring fish and we were more fresh water. Sure, we could do thanksgivings and rally runs and skeet shoots together, but when it came to getting rich or staying that way, Uncle Lou was the outlier independent of his own misfortunes.</p>
<p>“Hundred,” we heard Gerry Dekryger yell, which meant Grandpa was losing, too.</p>
<p>Cousin Lou lined up along the rope, held the first hatchet above his head, flexed his neck, threw and scored ten. His eyelid twitched as he threw the second, thirty points it was, and then the third which stuck within inches of the bullseye. The kid with the juice-box walked up like Einstein deciphering figures. My dad coughed. Cousin Lou patted him on the shoulder. “Don’t worry, Biddy,” he said. “You can come over, anytime. Over to my side of the bridge where the possum’s always fresh.”</p>
<p>The kid handed my dad the hatchets. “You want me to believe?’ he yelled. A few party goers perked up, gave dirty looks like he’d interrupted their conversation.</p>
<p>There was a brief pause in the action for that. “Yeah,” Grandpa’s voice answered.</p>
<p>“I believe I’m about to kick the shit out of Cousin Lou in three seconds,” Dad said. “I believe, if my diabeetus gets worse, that it might be the end before I get hold of him. I believe I’ll eat that entire pig if someone don’t fix me a plate. I believe I’m about to eat this damn hatchet kid.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Dad,” I said.</p>
<p>“Easy, Biddy,” Uncle Rick’s voice said.</p>
<p>He threw the first axe. Missed and people scoffed. He threw the second. It stuck into the roots of the tree. “Ah hell,” he threw the third as hard as he could. The axe head clipped the tree and the shard bounced from the coin-toss table.</p>
<p>“Two Hundred,” Cousin Lou said and raised his hands.</p>
<p>Just then Jay Hicks cleared his throat and talked through a microphone on the front porch. “Now don’t forget to stick around everybody. There’s a special surprise this year. The great unveiling is coming soon. So eat up, drink, and buy those tickets.”</p>
<p>“Triple it,” my dad said and slapped more tickets down on the stump, but his missing went on for hours. A chair and a plate were finally brought to him.  He threw hatchets while sitting down and eating. While chewing he grew more and more depressed between throws, until betting everything, and then busting zero.</p>
<p>“Biddy’s down!” a voice said.</p>
<p>The night drew on. The humidity settled along the river, and what was left of the sun evaporated along the leather seats of the Master Craft. River folk were getting richer: Cousin Lou and Jay Hicks and Gerry Dekryger. Even Angel Rojas had collected about three hundred of Grandpa’s casino money, not to mention the kids with the change belts who would stuff it inside bell jars and forget where they buried it.</p>
<p>A few cars kicked dust as they rattled uphill and toward home. “There’s still a surprise coming,” Jay Hicks said over the microphone. “Until then, there’s plenty of beer, and if there isn’t, we can afford to get more. Stick around,” he said, and the band started playing again.</p>
<p>As far as the Storms family was concerned Grandpa was drunk and leaning sideways in his folding chair. Uncle Rick had disappeared into one of a hundred parked cars with smoke seeping from the windows. Along picnic tables my dad picked over the deviled eggs saying, “Hey. We’d better stock up now or we’ll be eating possum for the rest of the year.” Small niche groups melded into one another. Beer cans crushed. Blue buckets were filled, and at that time of night, whether you’re in the mood or not, the people you hadn’t talked to in a while, or ever—except for the times you caught them searching for dope plants along your property—liked to squeeze your arms and slap your back like beating an old rug.</p>
<p>They drool-talk about the shit they’d heard you’d done. Their accents grow thicker. “Yawmp,” they say when agreeing. “Yawmp,” they say when you ask them where they’ve been.</p>
<p>This is all to say that Brian Earl and Stacey Parks came up to me while I was standing alone by the fire. “Rocky,” they kept saying. “It’s good to see you. What you been up to? How’s life treating you?” Followed by about ten or more back slaps and then I swear they tried to kiss my ears for falling.</p>
<p>“Fine, I guess.” I suppose I could have asked them about the pot pants they’d tried stealing to pay the rent, which was understandable. You do what you have to do, but talking about anything even slightly incriminating was just that, and not quite polite.</p>
<p>Their faces shined red in the light of the fire and you couldn’t see their eyes for their constant smiling. They only widened their mouths and stared at you from the side while pouring the last of a cold-one down their gullets. I stood there watching the flames.</p>
<p>“’Member, Stacey,” Brian Earl said to his friend. “This kid saved Angel’s life. That’s your damn sister.”</p>
<p>“Yawmp,” Stacey said. “We owe him.” She pointed at nothing with her beer-can-hand. “The family owes him.”</p>
<p>“The Storms’ are good people,” Brian said. He too raised his can and wiped the spittle.</p>
<p>“Tell us the story,” he said. “What happened? I heard it a hundred times from Angel, but I want to hear it from you. The horse. I mean the source.”</p>
<p>“Ain’t much to tell,” I said.</p>
<p>“Bullshit. I heard this guy came into the store just nuts, crazy like rabies, and as soon as you seen that gun, before this guy could even aim the thing, you had him laid out with a left.” Brian dug a couple jabs at the air.</p>
<p>Stacey said. “Angel’s pregnant now.”</p>
<p>Brian said. “So you pretty much saved her baby.”</p>
<p>I looked toward the concession window. Angel cleared plastic cups from the windowsills, rinsed them in the laundry sink and talked away to my Cousin Lou who was holding a plate of pig in one hand and a shot of whiskey in the other.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” I said. “You just feel like you don’t want people pushing you around. Like water comes up to your heart and you act on it. Then it’s over and people talk to you a lot more.”</p>
<p>“Yawmp.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t really save her life,” I said. “It was just a squirt gun.”</p>
<p>“Still. You don’t know what that guy was capable of.”</p>
<p>“Maybe he had a knife,” Stacey said. “Then where would that baby be?”</p>
<p>We stared at nothing, an empty cardboard case and the way the logs were consumed by the flames.</p>
<p>It got dark not long after.</p>
<p>The porch had cleared of coolers and bun wrappers. Moths swarmed around the yard light behind Jay Hicks and his microphone. “Five minutes, folks,” he said. “But before we get going I want to thank everyone for coming. It’s been a record breaking year and I don’t think any of us would trade in this living…” He paused like hiccupping. “Hell with it. We just have to count our blessing around here,” he said. “But if you’re waiting, want to kill a few minutes. Hank Storms’ and Gerry Dekryger are still at it. They’ve been going at it for what,” he bent toward his wife who stood beside him. ‘Wow. Really?’ he said with his hand over the microphone. “Six Hours, Ladies and Gentlemen. And it’s coming to a head. Don’t blink.”</p>
<p>A few stragglers and I moved over toward the card table in the dark. Those who didn’t stayed by the fire. In his chair Grandpa was smirking and leaning left and his fur coat looked ragged as if someone had picked him from the dirt with it a few times. “Rocky,” he says to me, “Just in time. You still got your wad?” he asked.</p>
<p>I felt in my pocket. I’d only lost thirty bucks on the coin table and still had about nine hundred to spare. I could barely take my hand from my pocket without it falling. “Yawmp,” I said.</p>
<p>Grandpa Storms coughed until his eyes watered, coughed until he beat his chest and his heart went back on rhythm.</p>
<p>“Jesus. You allright,” someone asked.</p>
<p>“No,” Grandpa said. “But I’m still playing.”</p>
<p>The orange flash of the bonfire lit Grandpa Storms’ face. He leaned over like his stomach had gone weak. Gerry Dekryger watched his stack, the last remnants, two-hundred at most, as Grandpa watched the air, not the willow trees or the card table, his eyes wider than Croton Dam which stayed fixed on nothing.</p>
<p>“Hey, Ticket Girl,” he said. “Come over here.”</p>
<p>One of the kids with a change belt came over, her dirty rainbow shirt about three sizes too big.</p>
<p>“You’re a Vincent, aren’t you?” he asked. “You’re momma drove bus for a long time. Didn’t she die driving that bus?”</p>
<p>“Hey, now,” Gerry said.</p>
<p>The little girl nodded.</p>
<p>“You’ve been doing a good job tonight,” he said. “And you’ve put up with too much. Or let’s say enough.” He took up the rest of his stack and handed it over. “That’s for you,” he said.</p>
<p>Gerry Dekryger slapped the table. “I ain’t won yet,” he said. “C’mon. Gimme a chance to win.”</p>
<p>“Easy,” Grandpa said. And just as Gerry was about to stand up, jump over the table to snatch him by the rabbit collar, Jay Hicks’ voice squealed over the microphone.</p>
<p>“AND NOW IS THE TIME,” he said under the beams of the moth-light. People stopped, listened; even Gerry eased away from the Euchre table. “If you look to your left we have the Grand Finale. I’ve been working on this baby a long time and here she is. So Double Down. Someone’s about to get rich if you got the guts.”</p>
<p>From the shadows of Ash trees they wheeled the contraption: Cousin Lou and the change girls pushing, digging in their feet and shoving like finding something pulled from the deepest mud. Its wheels squeaked as it moved over the grass. A blue tarp strained over an enormous wooden bowl made of two-by-twos and bolts and bungee straps. Water sloshed like a hundred hot tubs. The girl in the rainbow shirt darted over and helped with a final shove as the wood strained and the entire contraption rested under the willow tree, a thick rope dangling from the strongest branch above it.</p>
<p>“Rocky,” Grandpa said to me. I could only twitch. I didn’t have time for anything else. He yelled, “Rocky boy has nine hundred on it.”</p>
<p>The fire popped and even the river kids perked up their heads and looked at me scratching my neck.</p>
<p>“Okay. We already have takers,” Jay Hicks said. “But if you allow me to finish, what we have here ladies and gentlemen is a Jay Hicks Original. Well,” he said with his wife standing by his side, “Lady Hicks had the idea. I just had the hands. The material from Hank’s scrap heap.” Jay shot a can into one of the can buckets. “The longest anyone has lasted is five dunks, but it’s up to you how long you last, how long you can hang, as Lady Hicks, says—and the wagers are on the table.”</p>
<p>A log dropped in the fire. “I’ve got fifty on that,” Cousin Lou said from the picnic coolers.</p>
<p>“Put me in for thirty,” Angel Rojas said from the concession window. And then Brian Earl in his jean coat. And then Stacey, and then Dave Burkle the mechanic. Even the Vincent kids put theirs quarters on the table after a small tug-of-war over plastic bags.</p>
<p>From the woodshed two ladders were hurried over and set apart next to the contraption. Slapped across their tops were two painters’ planks. “There you go,” Jay said. “Flip that one over.” One of the change kids climbed up, flipped it, went onto it, snatched the rope that hung from the tree and a pulley system, and then threw down one of the rope ends where it thumped to the ground. “And now it’s time for the wager,” Jay Hicks said. “Rocky Storms,” he said to me. “How long do you think you can last? “Three? Four? Maybe seven if you have it in you?”</p>
<p>Of course I didn’t know what to say. “You got this, Rock,” Grandpa said from somewhere. I tried to believe in it, the wager in itself as if whatever I said would come true, but when I said it I wasn’t exactly sure where it came from.</p>
<p>“What’s the record?” I asked and scratched my neck.</p>
<p>“Five,” Jay Hicks said. “And Dave Burkle almost died tying that. So don’t go too nuts.”</p>
<p>“Make it seven,” I said, maybe not thinking, maybe not worrying or wondering what might be best, or where I’d stand amongst a million outcomes. The drummer of the band did a roll on a pickle bucket as I climbed the ladder and lay down on the planks. Above me the willow branches swayed from the wind. My feet were tied with the rope that felt like hard twine, something for a small horse or to keep a mean dog from chewing through and wandering. They pulled and hoisted, Cousin Lou and Gerry Dekryger, arguing about who was stronger and who had the best foot position. “Fine. Your skinny ass wants to be the anchor. Be my guest.” They yanked. My feet rose. And then again and again until I was finally suspended and looking down at the tub of water with dead leaves and a beer can floating along its edges.</p>
<p>“You ready, Rocky,” someone asked.</p>
<p>Bodies were upside down and they’d turned to something like shadows from the yard light behind them.</p>
<p>“Ready,” I said.</p>
<p>“And on the count of three. One, Two, …”</p>
<p>The rope loosed, and before I could catch my bearing of being submerged they hoisted me back out with water stuck up my nose. I coughed it out and noticed blurry black and yellow shapes and smelled smoke.</p>
<p>“Again?” a voice asked.</p>
<p>“Again,” I spat.</p>
<p>They let go; I dunked twice, and then three times, and then four, until I didn’t know the timing, just spitting or blowing bubbles, or when to open my eyes and be safe and finally say I’d won. Of course in my life I thought of what it’d be like to drown, a warm crawling into bed feeling after the last gasp.</p>
<p>“Okay?” they said.</p>
<p>I had my thumbs up, the international sign for keeping the shit rolling. “Okay,” I kept saying, maybe under water, maybe until all of the shapes turned into a blurred mass of yard lights and smoke. “Okay,” I said again after rising and spitting. “Okay,” but winning or not, for as long as they kept at it, for as long as the pulley squeaked and my shoulders splashed and the lights faded, I felt, for everyone along the river, I’d be putting up for those who’d spent their entire lives trying to remember, like strange dreams fading after long mornings, what it was like to come out on the winning end when a million forces told us otherwise.</p>

With turkey tail fungi<br />
And Touch-Me-Not,<br />
You know this:<br />
The stream overflows<br />
And goes back again.</p>
<p>Going back again,<br />
Purple Judas trees open<br />
In clouds, the heavy scent of<br />
Bloodroot and unblinking<br />
Stare of Doll’s Eye<br />
Following gradually.</p>
<p>Following then<br />
That this is no-man’s-<br />
Land electric with nettles<br />
And the violent proof of burs<br />
That drop off eventually—who<br />
Traffics half-waterways?</p>
<p>Those who traffic half-waterways<br />
Under doves nestled like water<br />
In the crooks of trees know<br />
Minnows sew shadows to sandbars with needle<br />
Flash, the doves mourning for no reason<br />
You can decipher.</p>
<p>You can’t cipher<br />
Their explosion into non-water,<br />
Wings bursting, into this: the way<br />
The lone wind comes, rustles<br />
One blade of grass, begins<br />
To whisper, <em>I am here</em>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Muscles tighten, noosing my neck to my rump, and this from a car wreck my husband says could not have caused such an ache. He’s the one suggested the swimming so my husband has only himself to blame for the backstroker eyeing the hairs lapping the edge of my swimsuit. Next thing I’m in the changing stall helping the backstroker tug the swimsuit down my hips.</p>
<p>“The rabbit was tranquilized for the bath,” said the animal technician, whose hands seemed to know better uses for such pets. “Otherwise panic, maybe drown.” He drew up my rabbit’s scruff, placed needle flush to the skin, plunged.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t hurt,” I said before he could, thinking what came over me in the pool — leaving waters where pain had no hold to do such a thing with a backstroker?</p>
<p>“Why can’t the doctor dispense the medication?” Marty said as I lined up syringes alongside my swimsuit draining into the tub. “I don’t do needles.”</p>
<p>I said, “When you see that bill.”</p>
<p>“Shoot him after. We’ll be late for the party.”</p>
<p>I asked around at the party if anyone knew how to give an injection. The great nephew of the birthday girl told me to pinch a flap of skin before sticking the needle. “Sometimes you hit a nerve anyway.” He tenderly patted his hip, where daily he injected insulin.</p>
<p>“Can I see?” I said, tugging up his shirt.</p>
<p>The great nephew grinned with slitty, stoned eyes, old enough to think everything was a game.</p>
<p>All through the song, the birthday girl’s husband never took his eyes off his wife. The flames of 80 candles undulated above the Olympic-sized cake. Yellow licks of light shone against the great nephew’s wet lips.</p>
<p>“Come home with me?” I said to the great nephew. “To inject my rabbit.” Plates got passed around, and my fingers forked up cake and pressed it against his closed mouth, frosting it aquamarine. I was willing to clean the mess with my lips, anything to avoid antagonizing my rabbit. It hurt that bad.</p>
<p>“Need a napkin,” Marty asked the great nephew, bringing a stack against my mouth.</p>
<p>The rabbit’s a friendly bastard but he sensed queerness in me, which he mistook for fear. Kneeling on the bathroom tile, syringe in hand, I was Nurse in a child’s game. There was a raw teardrop-shaped target on his neck left by the sickness. My finger stroked his veiny ear until I was out of what felt like patience — but was probably nerve — and discharged the syringe.</p>
<p>Toothbrush vibrating, Marty watched the prick of blood swell into air as the rabbit sprung out of my grip. Droplets of tawny fur splattering the floor.</p>
<p>I crawled under the sink after the rabbit. Marty spit out toothpaste before lifting a leg to let me pass. I pinned the rabbit’s head with one hand, the other hand aiming the needle for the nape — where was the third hand for pinching skin? — when the rabbit slithered belly out from under my palm, flashing dirty furred soles.</p>
<p>He crouched behind the toilet, thump-thumping his hind leg, alerting other bunnies that danger’s afoot. I popped my fist into its rump, and he walked out dog-style from behind the tender porcelain. I shoved the rabbit into the V of my legs. The time for stroking had come and gone. Thin grunts crackled up his throat. I pulled up the muscled jaw, needle-tapped the scruff, stuck, blood dotting, and entered.</p>
<p>“Leave him alone,” Marty said as he kicked crap balls the rabbit let fly the instant I hit maybe a nerve.</p>
<p>Motorized by pain, the rabbit bounded off tile, the loaded needle flapping from a neck the technician said was not so sensitive.</p>
<p>Birthday cocktail flooded my throat. “We could use that nephew who shot shots.”</p>
<p>“You sure could.” Marty shut the door behind him.</p>
<p>There is something about knowing you have caused the pain that makes you the shit that can follow it through. I snatched up the syringe from behind the toilet.</p>
<p>Marty said that all night he’d been thinking about ways to restrain our rabbit for this morning’s injection. He came up with this: set the rabbit in a shoebox then wrap and fasten with a cord. “If he can’t fight,” Marty said, “he won’t get hurt.”</p>
<p>The rabbit and I met again in the bathroom. It hopped out to greet me, not knowing that I was meaner than pain, and that was what it took. Marty’s shoebox idea guided me to the bathtub, where sunlight from one narrow window fingered the swimsuit stiffening there. Held in by four sides and me, the rabbit could only widen eyes as I pinched up skin at the hot target behind the ears and poked in. I hit the plunger. This time the rabbit just shook his ears, throwing off a bad thought.</p>
<p>“You did it so fast?” Marty said when I plodded out.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t take the blame last night,” I said.</p>
<p>“That got in the way?”</p>
<p>The muscles in my back had shortened like leather cords in some desert torture. I would grow long again in water. As I tugged up my swimsuit, Marty handed over the bag but his fingers gripped the mesh. “There’s other uses for those legs,” he said.</p>
<p>“Marty, my body responds to the water.”</p>
<p>Floaters strapped on backs, the old have come out in numbers today. I dangle my legs over the lip of the pool, watching their heads turn tranquil as water. In water the body can cheat. These swimmers know this as they eye each other across lanes, remembering better uses for hips than straining over porcelain seats, believing, still believing, even after all those laps, that infidelity is balm.</p>
<p>I haul my legs out of the water. The time for stroking has come and gone. The rabbit will get hurt, but at least he can put up a fight.</p>
<p>Pain, Marty, is the shit that will get us through.</p>

<p>Wouldn&#8217;t give you the name<br />
of every animal I&#8217;ve eaten<br />
even if I wanted to<br />
(unless you asked me nicely).</p>
<p>Unsurprising pig, fish<br />
bovine, fowl&#8211;consumed<br />
their bodies all<br />
with no remorse. But</p>
<p>if I told you I&#8217;d chewed up<br />
alligator, frog legs&#8211;slick<br />
unsympathetic beasts&#8211;<br />
would you flinch? Maybe<br />
but not because of love.</p>
<p>So if I tell you the names<br />
of the creatures I&#8217;ve swallowed<br />
that you could care for<br />
promise me you&#8217;ll cringe<br />
where I can see you.</p>
<p>Show me your face<br />
when I tell you how<br />
I&#8217;ve savored the taste<br />
of kangaroo and squirrel,</p>
<p>had seconds of raccoon<br />
and tender elk. Don&#8217;t look<br />
away when I tell you how<br />
I&#8217;ve devoured hare<br />
and youngling deer.</p>
<p>Watch me while I describe<br />
the way my teeth have torn<br />
the flesh from the bones<br />
of innocent things.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Doon scoops sugar over the pumpkin pulp<br />
pulled ridgy from the tinplate can</p>
<p>like the tunnel that runs under the river where he likes<br />
to shout his name. Arlo breaks an egg over that</p>
<p>and marvels at the cracked peel,<br />
its underside slippery like wet leaves.</p>
<p><em>Is this the chicken’s skin?</em> he asks.<br />
Earlier, when we woke before everyone else</p>
<p>he told me to be careful wiping his cheek with a cloth<br />
because there are bones inside him.</p>
<p>Every day freezing water that should be snow<br />
pools in the sinkholes on our street and carries the sky</p>
<p>upside down, a peculiar enantiodromia if you look<br />
for a while, which I do.</p>
<p>The earth is warming. In the playground where I hide<br />
in another book by the furtive Italian</p>
<p>I hear a woman say, <em>68 degrees in February</em><br />
<em> and liberals are going to complain about it</em>.</p>
<p>But earth-orbiting satellites can already see</p>
<p>the glacier’s cycle of retreat—<br />
Not six-thousand years from now</p>
<p>but now.</p>
<p>Arlo’s head is a new moon, a silk cocoon<br />
spun by the tireless caterpillar who twists her body</p>
<p>into thousands of figure eights for each strand.<br />
I can’t stop kissing it in the kitchen,</p>
<p>the last infant hair<br />
I’ll know. I hate to think not one strand of it</p>
<p>will be discovered in ocean residue<br />
or tree rings or sedimentary rocks. That this is all</p>
<p>we’ve got: afternoon with ten extra minutes<br />
of daylight; glass bowl of pulp and sugar. Four small hands</p>
<p>moving wildly over it</p>
<p>like a dial measuring the composition of air<br />
or birds scattering on the snow.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My grandmother lifts the corners<br />
of her mouth—a smile with no teeth;<br />
open palms coaxing me to her side.<br />
It’s hot, the thick air sticky on skin.</p>
<p>I stay at my mother’s side, fingers<br />
busy pleating the hem of her skirt<br />
where I can hide. There’s Uncle Kazuo<br />
and Dad. My brother isn’t poking</p>
<p>at my mosquito bites, but joining in<br />
with the many voices speaking<br />
in pidgin about “dem cars.”<br />
Then Mom’s hands rest on my shoulders,</p>
<p>pushing me away, telling me “be good.”<br />
Grandma leads me outside<br />
to where Chinese doves politely bow<br />
at our feet and a red cardinal</p>
<p>hops into a five-gallon glass jar, pecking<br />
up feed. I skirt the shade of the mango tree,<br />
tiptoeing past puddles of shattered fruit<br />
where the fruit flies hover low</p>
<p>close to the ground. I don’t like Hawai’i.<br />
Running to the driveway, I see<br />
our Chevrolet’s tires churns with dust.<br />
In the rear window, the three black heads</p>
<p>of my family disappear.<br />
My zori slippers slap against my heels,<br />
but no one looks back. Around me,<br />
the sun’s rays are the bars of a prison.</p>
<p>“Bumbye, they come home,” Grandma calls.<br />
“I give you mango, yes?” I don’t understand<br />
what she says about Uncle’s car ‘no go’,<br />
about a battery, or the two orange ovals</p>
<p>she cradles against her body. From her kitchen<br />
door, I watch as she peels the skin,<br />
slicing the fruit. All I know is that the juice<br />
stings the small cuts in my mouth.</p>
