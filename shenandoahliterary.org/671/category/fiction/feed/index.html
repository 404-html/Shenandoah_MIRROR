								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The weekend the Hicks’ had their Bonfire Party, coincidentally, was five days after Grandpa Storms had won Jackpot at Casino, again.</p>
<p>It was Sunday.</p>
<p>We were already well fed from a breakfast that consisted of whiskey-hash and the venison steaks he’d pulled from his brand new utility freezer. It was one of Grandpa’s lifetime dreams to have an enormous store of food that lasted longer than a month, and not just to eat, but to eat well if we’d bottomed out into darkness, again. I remember Grandpa always held up his fork at the kitchen table with a venison steak on the end. ‘Credit is Bullshit. Cash is King,’ he always said.</p>
<p>Along with that utility freezer, with his most recent Jackpot money Grandpa had also bought a camouflage flat-bottom with a fifteen pony engine that was advertised as being able to hide like a cloud to the underwater eyes of trout and steelhead. He bought it from Dekryger Marina. There were pool tables along the showroom floor, and rope, and yellow canoes, life preservers for kids, and deep in the corner that camouflage Mastercraft shining with diamond dust within the carbon fiber. Gerry Dekryger owned the place, an old pal of our family who’d helped clear trees along our river property. But when he’d seen Grandpa fiddling with the throttle body and pressing buttons on the computerized fish finder, he emerged from his office and said, “Hank. You’re my pal, a damn lifelong friend, and you know that you can usually come to me for anything, but don’t make me do this in front of the boy.”</p>
<p>“What are you trying saying?” Grandpa asked.</p>
<p>“Basically,” Gerry said and tapped a non-filter to a gold lighter, “if credit scores were dead dogs, you’d walk out the door with her. But as far as I remember, old Dixie’s been rotting a little too long to be worth a shit.”</p>
<p>Grandpa’s eyes didn’t move from the diamond trim, the traction improved step-sides and the foldaway tackle boxes. Grandpa strolled over to the pool table, and from his coveralls splashed down a wad of hundreds like a firecracker blew in his hand.</p>
<p>“How ‘bout these dead dogs?” Grandpa said.</p>
<p>During that week Grandpa had also paid off twenty years of late fees at the Rent-All, not to mention a nagging bench-warrant for an incident with some pot plants next to the Gerber Factory. When the county deputy asked him how the hell could he dig himself out of a hole that most people died trying to wheedle themselves from, Grandpa said it was his ability to win, to throw all common sense aside at just the right moment which had saved our lives more often than steady paychecks. At Casino Grandpa said his biggest advantage to coming up roses was that he wasn’t superstitious. He didn’t sniff slot machines. He didn’t lick tit for luck, either.</p>
<p>So down the aisles of flashing machines with names like Slot-father and Volcano Gold which stood inside clock-less, air conditioned mega-structures where the disabled sat in wheelchairs with pink visors and mood crystals in their laps, grandpa patrolled in his rabbit coat. He’d pass a few dummy aisles, the Chippewa collection zones, he called them, and then pretty soon, holding the wishbone ends of a peach branch lightly between his fingertips, his elbows would start shaking. He’d fall forward like the spirit of Jesus had walked by and hit him with a towel. He’d close his eyes, herk, jab somebody in the side or in the back of the head before finding an empty stool at a blackjack table, or a machine about to burst while the branch bent clean toward his ankles.</p>
<p>“It’s embarrassing,” my dad said and smoked. We were cruising in the Mastercraft, the bottom scuffing the dirt, and then my dad said, “You don’t even want to be around him with people looking at us like we’re hillbilly dipshits.” He took a long drink from his can of Natural and closed the Mastercraft’s secret compartment. “And there isn’t a single person he won’t tip. Those drink girls that put umbrellas in your cocktails. Those door boys. Old women in pink hats. Then, and this is the funny part, he even tipped one of those Paws-for a-Cause dogs with the blue vests. Gave him a pet and tucked a ten right in his little vest. What the fuck is a dog going to do with ten bucks?”</p>
<p>“Buy dog biscuits,” I said.</p>
<p>“Cute. Thanks, Mark,” my dad said. “You’re a huge help.”</p>
<p>Grandpa gave a funny look like smelling rotten septic. He steered the Mastercraft around a felled log. “Mark? Who the hell’s Mark?” he asked. “The boy’s name is Rocky, now.”</p>
<p>My dad might have been the biggest guy in the county but he had fifteen nicknames and hated every one of them: Big Bill, Honcho, Billy Donut. This is a man who used to be able to carry refrigerators up stairwells like suitcases. Now he was four hundred plus in 57 overalls. He’d gotten even bigger in the calves from getting laid off truck driving where he said his bosses didn’t give a shit if he was hungry. ‘Drive or quit,’ they told him. Only on the boat his shoulder blades were wider than the seat back, and if it wasn’t for Grandpa buying supplies for the party for a counter weight—steaks, six cases of Natural, ice, fireworks, bundles cedar logs, two gallons of Kesslers—with a single step of ‘Big Bill’s’ size fifteen we’d have lost Grandpa’s new boat long before any promises of opening the throttle were kept.</p>
<p>We had to keep the boat in first gear is what I’m saying. No sudden turns while the water crept up the sides and my dad bitched about its fancy seat. “Bastard won’t turn,” he said and kept shifting. We checked ours. They spun like swivels. Grandpa leaned forward and inspected the reinforced steel post underneath Big Bill. “Good God,” Grandpa said. “You’ve sheared off the swirly-do. That seat’s got your name on it, now. Actually, just so you don’t ruin the others, I’ll write your name on the bastard.” Grandpa took a marker from his tackle box, cut the engine, the boat floated rotila style underneath willow branches and in big letters he wrote, “Big Boy,” on the new leather.</p>
<p>“Biddy Boy,” Uncle Rick said and drank.</p>
<p>“Watch it,” my dad said.</p>
<p>The motor bogged through the shallows. Uncle Rick sat in the opposite, but still swiveling bucket seat. He’d had a few jobs in different states. Hated it when bosses wouldn’t give him time off and, as he said, did little accounting riddles with his paychecks. What can I say?  Uncle Rick was living with us, again.</p>
<p>As we moved upstream I had my pellet gun and was shooting empty beer cans floating in the water. I popped one. A flock of birds flew from a willow and swirled like smoke. That’s when Grandpa dug inside the groceries and yanked out a Kesslers. “You know the trick to winning the Jackpot?” he asked and inspected the bottle. “The trick to winning at life?”</p>
<p>“Money,” my dad said. “Work.”</p>
<p>“Supreme confidence,” Grandpa said. “You gotta know you’re the winner above all those other poor folk. Tell it on the mountain if you have to. ‘I’m the winner,’ say. ‘I’m gonna find a trillion dollars with my divinin’ stick,’ say. Know it like you know you’re the toughest kid in the county.” He took another drink. “Ain’t that right, Rocky?”</p>
<p>I shrugged, kept searching for cans floating near the shores. I couldn’t shoot any because most of them were still inside the hands of tubers, actual human beings as they floated from the bridge to Maple Island wedged inside rubber tubes. Uncle Rick raised a can at them: the international sign for peace on earth.</p>
<p>“Member when Rocky knocked the hell out of that mugger bugger?” Grandpa said. “Pop! Out cold as February. I think they put your name in the paper on that one. I mean, I didn’t see the paper so don’t get your hopes up. But I’ve been telling that story all year. I’ll tell it every year. What’s her name? That clerk girl you saved.”</p>
<p>“Angel,” Uncle Rick said and threw a can in the compartment.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Pretty little Angel,” Grandpa said.</p>
<p>So I’d walked into Ashcroft’s Gas and Grocery a month earlier. So, while I was standing there about to buy some deer jerky, I hear, ‘put the money in the bag, bitch.’ It’s not that I knew what to do. Whenever Grandpa told me to cut wood or dig a hole for deer guts I did what I was told. I guess those muscles came in handy for once.</p>
<p>“Bullshit. He didn’t save that place of fifty cents,” my dad said. “Bastard kid held up the girl with a squirt gun.” My dad gave me a flat look with his chin tucked near his chest. I watched the shore, the dead ash trees like bones and wished his chair swiveled. I mean, this is a man, when he ate ice-cream, his entire hand engulfed the half gallon.  His eyes didn’t move as he said, “Only now we have to get him working, again.”</p>
<p>“Naw. We’ll get him fightin’,” Grandpa said. “Them octagon or pentagram fights. King of the Cage. That’ll be Rocky in what?” He flipped a finger toward Uncle Rick. “Five years, ya say? Then we’ll see who the badass of the family is. Some guy named BoneCrusher will knock him square in the lips and he’ll get paid for it. We’ll eat for three years. ‘Bonecrusher money’, we’ll call it.” Grandpa made a fist, punched his palm and yipped. “Pay the Man!!”</p>
<p>I spun the pellet gun between my feet, smiled because I liked hearing that somewhere in the future I might get paid for once. I’d be the one that helped for once. Where other people would’ve been scared I’d have the guts for once. Maybe it was a million bullies I was fighting, but when the bastard held the gun on Angel Rojas shaking from nerves, skinny from hunger, it was like water crept toward my heart and the pressure dove straight toward my fist like spontaneous human combustions.</p>
<p>‘Holy shit,’ Angel had said. ‘Wait, wait. Hold him there, Mark. I’ll call my cousins. Wait. No. The cops! We’re all legal on this, I think.’</p>
<p>Sticks of venison jerky littered the floor and I may have piddled. Only my dad wouldn’t stop staring at me from his newly broken seat. “If he don’t quit first,” he said, because, in our world, the largest sin a person could commit was quitting. Hungry? Keep working. Tired? Fingers raw?  Is the company docking your paycheck? Go to work or be fired.</p>
<p>“Baaa,” Grandpa said. “We’re tired of this talk.”</p>
<p>“No. Really,” my dad said. “You want to call him Rocky, now. Let’s talk about that nickname a second.”</p>
<p>“Don’t listen to this, Rocky,” Grandpa said. “It’s his own bullshit he can’t quite put a finger on.”</p>
<p>Underwater I could see the dark outlines of Salmon as they shot toward the banks from our passing. “Where’d you work last month, Mark?” my dad asked me.</p>
<p>“The Shack,” I said. “The resort with those log cabins. It’s not like everyone doesn’t know.”</p>
<p>“You worked for those bastards?” Uncle Rick said.</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>“Dishwashing right?” my dad asked me.</p>
<p>I didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>“Right,” my dad said. “So Mark gets this dishwashing job, right. Decent job. Not great. But decent for guys like us.”</p>
<p>“Sure,” Uncle Rick said. “Right where they like to keep us. With their boots on our necks.”</p>
<p>“The kid’s fourteen,” my dad said.</p>
<p>Uncle Rick mumbled and drank.</p>
<p>“Anyway, listen,” my dad said. “The thing is he’s got this boss. Guy’s got some kind of social problem. A real piece of love, this guy. What can I say? A bully. He bullied him. What did you say he said, Mark?”</p>
<p>“Rocky,” Grandpa said. “His name’s Rocky.”</p>
<p>“Fine. Rocky. Let’s get this out in the open, Rock.”</p>
<p>I kept watching people in their inner tubes, hooking their feet underneath coolers and thinking about how, a couple hours from then, they’d be in their cars, driving from the boat launches and back toward the city. “I don’t know,” I said. “He told me to shut up and stuff. Said I was stupid for not carrying glasses right or whatever…”</p>
<p>“That ain’t what you told me. C’mon, Rock. Let’s get honest here.”</p>
<p>“…‘sit,” I said.</p>
<p>“That ain’t it. Fine. I’ll tell it for you, then.” My dad found a way to spin his legs around toward the middle of the boat where both heels were now splayed over the carpet toward Uncle Rick. The boat leaned. Grandpa stepped left to keep her even. “So Rocky is carrying wine bottles. And this pecker wood of a boss pulls him aside every once in a while. He’s a real tall fucker, I guess. Liked to use that to his advantage. Usual stuff. Anyway, he gets Rocky aside and he says, ‘I know you eat at Sizzler a lot, but this is how you carry two wine bottles.’ He insults him by saying other shit, too. Like asking him if he knows what water is. Normal employee relations over there. But that one about the wine bottles should have been it.” My dad leaned over, grunted, took up a can and cracked it open. “But instead of keeping his face to the iron, Mark quits. Doesn’t do nothin’. Just quits.”</p>
<p>“What’s he supposed to do?” Uncle Rick said. “Either way he’s saved a girl.”</p>
<p>“All’s I’m saying is that, Rocky, if you’re going to call him that, you have to know the whole story. Especially if he ain’t workin’.”</p>
<p>“Either way is right,” Grandpa said to my dad. “Big Boy. I don’t care if you’re out of work or playing pixie stix, we ain’t bring that negativity shit with us, today. His name is Rocky and we’re winning. That’s the name of this day. This is winner day.”</p>
<p>From both shores of the river, the green banks with willows letting down their hair or the cliffs where the earth looked like it ripped in half from sheared sand and glaciers, smoke plumed from fire-pits. You could smell barbecue and rotten meat, something somebody in the city probably would eat with vinegar in the back of a bus.</p>
<p>“Jesus,” my dad said about it. “I’m losing my appetite.”</p>
<p>“Possum,” Uncle Rick said. “The other dark meat.”</p>
<p>“Get your mind off it,” Grandpa said.</p>
<p>We trolled upstream. With a little tooth whistle Grandpa Storms ushered Rick to take the wheel while he checked the pockets of his rabbit coat. Then he weaseled inside the secret compartments and under grocery bags.</p>
<p>“Get your mind off it,” Grandpa said, again. “And set your mind on these apples.” From a plastic bag he pulled out a stack of cash as tall as my hand was wide. Grandpa smelled it and snickered. He handed it over to Uncle Rick for a sniff while my dad jerked to turn around. He gave up when the bucket seat snapped down three more inches.</p>
<p>“The hell they doing back there?” he asked me.</p>
<p>Behind his back Grandpa Storms held a fist to his eye and his other palm against the side of his face.</p>
<p>“Drinking,” I said.</p>
<p>Uncle rick slowed, weaved the boat between people floating along on inner tubes.</p>
<p>“Listen up,” Grandpa said, which meant we knew there were rules coming. Like the time he told us not to turn on the headlights when pulling into private property, or the time we had to rub dirt on our clothes and faces before walking into the county court.</p>
<p>“We’re going to win,” Grandpa said. “That’s all that needs to be in your mind. Rick,” he said and slapped my uncle. “You’re on horseshoes. Bet big in the beginning to scare the chickens. And Big Boy. You’re on hatchet throwing. On your last toss bet the house to rattle their nerves. And Rocky?” He scratched his head. “I’ll figure it out. But you’re my ringer man.”</p>
<p>“What about you?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I’m on everything else. But there is one rule that matters above all the others.”</p>
<p>“Here we go,” Dad said.</p>
<p>“Believe,” Grandpa said. “Above all else.” He drank and lost his train of thought. “Less negativity and more positivity. And know you’re going to survive. And win,” he said. “And win and win. Until they’re naked on the ground giving you their last quarter. That’s your job. Got it?”</p>
<p>“Got it,” I said.</p>
<p>“And one more thing. If you get scared. If your little tiptoes start to quake and you think we’re going to be eating possum for another year, give your money to Rocky. He’ll take care of us.”</p>
<p>As we emerged from the shadow of the Bridgeton Bridge we heard the noises of river people. Horseshoes clanged iron stakes. The heads of axes thunked into Maplewood. The squeaks of metal folding chairs and the sounds of a hundred beer cans shuffling through ice and plastic told the world on two banks the party had started. We put the cash into our coats. We docked. We smelled sizzling pig, the warmth of cheese potatoes and cinnamon corn wrapped in foil. Like we did every year we came as a family, but when the old man arrived, from the fire-pit to the rope-swing people yelled Grandpa’s name as he strolled up with his rabbit coat bristling the wind. ‘Hank. Did you bring your divining stick?” Or, “Damn, how many Storms boys can fit into one boat?” “Hank, where the hell’s Biddy Boy?” The crowd grew quiet as my dad lurched over the hill half limping. “Jesus,” someone said. “Bill got big.”</p>
<p>Grandpa Storms shook hands like running for office. “We’re here to slow the economy,” he said.</p>
<p>The crowd of flannel shirts and dirty denim laughed. “What’s that you believin’ in?” someone yelled from the porch.</p>
<p>“I do believe,” Grandpa said and tightened his coat, “I do believe I have the fever.” And like a sword from his pant-leg out came the divining stick. Little boys pumped their fists and middle aged women in waders flapped their hands at the air. But Grandpa set to work. He closed his eyes, breathed deep, and with a quarter turn over the fire-pit, he stopped short. His elbows shook. The tip of the wishbone pointed near the horseshoe stakes, ‘the pits’ they called them, and bent downward where Jay Hicks, the owner of this property, stood with a tongue against his tooth, arms held high showing the world how to fit a fresh can into a beer koozie.</p>
<p>“Rick,” Grandpa said and shivered. “Quickly. I’m feeling faint.”</p>
<p>Uncle Rick took position and shook hands with Jay.</p>
<p>Grandpa moved on. Bodies cleared a path around the Euchre table, the Polish Ring Toss and the Ladder Bags. “Are you there, Big Boy,” Grandpa said. “Give me your energy.”</p>
<p>My dad hadn’t moved. He still leaned heavy against the porch from the climb up the bank. “Ya. I’ve been here,” he said.</p>
<p>Grandpa stepped toward a Maple tree where three hatchets were stuck. The bunny fur of Grandpa’s coat stood on end as he wobbled and caught himself by opening his eyes. “I see a fifty score in your future, Biddy. Maybe eighty.”</p>
<p>At the head of the cabin the shudder doors were opened wide where concessions were served, pig meat and pound cakes and three for a dollar colas and gambling stubs in increments of five to one hundred. Enormous white coolers were strewn along the planks with packages of ice and burger buns. Grandpa tripped over those. “Easy, Hank. The games are back this way,” Lisa Parks said, and then led him down the stairs where he brushed my father’s face with his elbow, shifted left, and then right, until stumbling and knocking over the Euchre table. I grabbed him by the arms and helped him sit. That’s where he dug a pint of whiskey from his coat pocket.</p>
<p>“Rocky,” he yelled and slapped the card table. Everyone from the DJ near the river to the barbecue girls walking around taking tickets shut up and listened.</p>
<p>“Right here, Grandpa,” I said.</p>
<p>“Kill a few hours,” he said. He took a drink. “Call ya when I need ya.”</p>
<p>The music started again. A few moments later at the concession Uncle Rick did the work procuring betting slips, handing the stacks to Angel Rojas who stood indoors near the Hicks’ kitchen stove. She had a visor hat on, and even though she only worked at Ashcrofts three nights a week, most people thought it was nice the Hicks’ barbecue carnival was good way for her to earn a few extra. Kids chased each other around a dunking pool and its rope dangling over the water. I noticed a few people I worked with where I quit washing dishes: Earl Ashbaugh and Jeremy Hicks around the outhouses puffing a pipe. The horseshoes clanged. Ping pong balls plopped into beer cups. “Fifty,” someone yelled. “Make that seventy five.” The ticket kids set to running.</p>
<p>I strolled along, waiting for my turn, so I went over to the stakes where Uncle Rick had already gotten started.</p>
<p>Dave Burkle, the mechanic who’d given us a deal on a transmission for our four by four stood at the opposite end in his jean coat. “Alaska?” he asked Uncle Rick. “How’d you find yourself way up there?”</p>
<p>“Guy in Colorado said they needed welders. And I needed money.”</p>
<p>“Find any?”</p>
<p>Uncle Rick mumbled. “I’m here, aren’t I?”</p>
<p>Dave Burkle held one eye closed, sized up the stake through the open end of the horseshoe. He threw. The iron flipped twice and it landed perfect. “Ringer. Fifty,” he yelled.</p>
<p>Uncle Rick swore. He slapped another four tickets on the tree stump.</p>
<p>“You’re going to win,” I told him. “Believe it, man.”</p>
<p>“You wanna try?” he asked.</p>
<p>I threw up my hands. “It ain’t my turn,” I said.</p>
<p>He mumbled something, stepped forward and threw. The horseshoe spun midair; sand puffed as it landed. “Nothin,” Dave Burkle said. “Twenty me.” A ticket girl, no more than ten years old with a change belt, snatched a ticket from the stump and walked it over from our side to his.</p>
<p>“Believe,” I said.</p>
<p>“Shut it,” he said.</p>
<p>I left Uncle Rick to the business because it turns out people in bad moods can rarely be saved. I passed the rope circles, ducked around lawn darts and looped around the blanket run. I went over to where the Vincents were bouncing quarters from a refrigerator door and into plastic cups. The Vincent kids collected pennies all year for this single game, walked ditches and plucked empty beer bottles from the side of the road. It was all the money they’d had and wanted to double it wisely. I set down a ticket, ten bucks worth, and in three tosses lost triple that.</p>
<p>Grandpa watched from the Euchre table. “Get out of it, Rock,” he said. “You can’t scare people with nothing to lose. Those Vincents are devils.”</p>
<p>A band started, some copy-cat band that could play for three hours straight with steel drums and smokes and headbands like the motion of plucking the strings was a thirty minute song all its own. I finally went over to where my dad was throwing axes. He sweated like the only man in a thunderstorm. His pants were wet in odd places. He kept pulling a handkerchief from his back pocket and wiping his glasses and neck.</p>
<p>“Good God,” I said “Have you got it in you?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” he said. “I think my ankle’s acting up, again. Or it’s this damn diabeetus. I might need to eat something.” He stuffed the handkerchief back into his pocket. The score looked bad, 80 to 3, and a kid sucking a fruit box kept walking over and handing him hatchets from the dirt. Our Cousin Lou stood against him, our blood relation, a person might think would be on our side when things turned for the worse. But Lou lived on the opposite side of the river, went to the Ratskellar bar instead of the 7 Mile and liked herring fish and we were more fresh water. Sure, we could do thanksgivings and rally runs and skeet shoots together, but when it came to getting rich or staying that way, Uncle Lou was the outlier independent of his own misfortunes.</p>
<p>“Hundred,” we heard Gerry Dekryger yell, which meant Grandpa was losing, too.</p>
<p>Cousin Lou lined up along the rope, held the first hatchet above his head, flexed his neck, threw and scored ten. His eyelid twitched as he threw the second, thirty points it was, and then the third which stuck within inches of the bullseye. The kid with the juice-box walked up like Einstein deciphering figures. My dad coughed. Cousin Lou patted him on the shoulder. “Don’t worry, Biddy,” he said. “You can come over, anytime. Over to my side of the bridge where the possum’s always fresh.”</p>
<p>The kid handed my dad the hatchets. “You want me to believe?’ he yelled. A few party goers perked up, gave dirty looks like he’d interrupted their conversation.</p>
<p>There was a brief pause in the action for that. “Yeah,” Grandpa’s voice answered.</p>
<p>“I believe I’m about to kick the shit out of Cousin Lou in three seconds,” Dad said. “I believe, if my diabeetus gets worse, that it might be the end before I get hold of him. I believe I’ll eat that entire pig if someone don’t fix me a plate. I believe I’m about to eat this damn hatchet kid.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Dad,” I said.</p>
<p>“Easy, Biddy,” Uncle Rick’s voice said.</p>
<p>He threw the first axe. Missed and people scoffed. He threw the second. It stuck into the roots of the tree. “Ah hell,” he threw the third as hard as he could. The axe head clipped the tree and the shard bounced from the coin-toss table.</p>
<p>“Two Hundred,” Cousin Lou said and raised his hands.</p>
<p>Just then Jay Hicks cleared his throat and talked through a microphone on the front porch. “Now don’t forget to stick around everybody. There’s a special surprise this year. The great unveiling is coming soon. So eat up, drink, and buy those tickets.”</p>
<p>“Triple it,” my dad said and slapped more tickets down on the stump, but his missing went on for hours. A chair and a plate were finally brought to him.  He threw hatchets while sitting down and eating. While chewing he grew more and more depressed between throws, until betting everything, and then busting zero.</p>
<p>“Biddy’s down!” a voice said.</p>
<p>The night drew on. The humidity settled along the river, and what was left of the sun evaporated along the leather seats of the Master Craft. River folk were getting richer: Cousin Lou and Jay Hicks and Gerry Dekryger. Even Angel Rojas had collected about three hundred of Grandpa’s casino money, not to mention the kids with the change belts who would stuff it inside bell jars and forget where they buried it.</p>
<p>A few cars kicked dust as they rattled uphill and toward home. “There’s still a surprise coming,” Jay Hicks said over the microphone. “Until then, there’s plenty of beer, and if there isn’t, we can afford to get more. Stick around,” he said, and the band started playing again.</p>
<p>As far as the Storms family was concerned Grandpa was drunk and leaning sideways in his folding chair. Uncle Rick had disappeared into one of a hundred parked cars with smoke seeping from the windows. Along picnic tables my dad picked over the deviled eggs saying, “Hey. We’d better stock up now or we’ll be eating possum for the rest of the year.” Small niche groups melded into one another. Beer cans crushed. Blue buckets were filled, and at that time of night, whether you’re in the mood or not, the people you hadn’t talked to in a while, or ever—except for the times you caught them searching for dope plants along your property—liked to squeeze your arms and slap your back like beating an old rug.</p>
<p>They drool-talk about the shit they’d heard you’d done. Their accents grow thicker. “Yawmp,” they say when agreeing. “Yawmp,” they say when you ask them where they’ve been.</p>
<p>This is all to say that Brian Earl and Stacey Parks came up to me while I was standing alone by the fire. “Rocky,” they kept saying. “It’s good to see you. What you been up to? How’s life treating you?” Followed by about ten or more back slaps and then I swear they tried to kiss my ears for falling.</p>
<p>“Fine, I guess.” I suppose I could have asked them about the pot pants they’d tried stealing to pay the rent, which was understandable. You do what you have to do, but talking about anything even slightly incriminating was just that, and not quite polite.</p>
<p>Their faces shined red in the light of the fire and you couldn’t see their eyes for their constant smiling. They only widened their mouths and stared at you from the side while pouring the last of a cold-one down their gullets. I stood there watching the flames.</p>
<p>“’Member, Stacey,” Brian Earl said to his friend. “This kid saved Angel’s life. That’s your damn sister.”</p>
<p>“Yawmp,” Stacey said. “We owe him.” She pointed at nothing with her beer-can-hand. “The family owes him.”</p>
<p>“The Storms’ are good people,” Brian said. He too raised his can and wiped the spittle.</p>
<p>“Tell us the story,” he said. “What happened? I heard it a hundred times from Angel, but I want to hear it from you. The horse. I mean the source.”</p>
<p>“Ain’t much to tell,” I said.</p>
<p>“Bullshit. I heard this guy came into the store just nuts, crazy like rabies, and as soon as you seen that gun, before this guy could even aim the thing, you had him laid out with a left.” Brian dug a couple jabs at the air.</p>
<p>Stacey said. “Angel’s pregnant now.”</p>
<p>Brian said. “So you pretty much saved her baby.”</p>
<p>I looked toward the concession window. Angel cleared plastic cups from the windowsills, rinsed them in the laundry sink and talked away to my Cousin Lou who was holding a plate of pig in one hand and a shot of whiskey in the other.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” I said. “You just feel like you don’t want people pushing you around. Like water comes up to your heart and you act on it. Then it’s over and people talk to you a lot more.”</p>
<p>“Yawmp.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t really save her life,” I said. “It was just a squirt gun.”</p>
<p>“Still. You don’t know what that guy was capable of.”</p>
<p>“Maybe he had a knife,” Stacey said. “Then where would that baby be?”</p>
<p>We stared at nothing, an empty cardboard case and the way the logs were consumed by the flames.</p>
<p>It got dark not long after.</p>
<p>The porch had cleared of coolers and bun wrappers. Moths swarmed around the yard light behind Jay Hicks and his microphone. “Five minutes, folks,” he said. “But before we get going I want to thank everyone for coming. It’s been a record breaking year and I don’t think any of us would trade in this living…” He paused like hiccupping. “Hell with it. We just have to count our blessing around here,” he said. “But if you’re waiting, want to kill a few minutes. Hank Storms’ and Gerry Dekryger are still at it. They’ve been going at it for what,” he bent toward his wife who stood beside him. ‘Wow. Really?’ he said with his hand over the microphone. “Six Hours, Ladies and Gentlemen. And it’s coming to a head. Don’t blink.”</p>
<p>A few stragglers and I moved over toward the card table in the dark. Those who didn’t stayed by the fire. In his chair Grandpa was smirking and leaning left and his fur coat looked ragged as if someone had picked him from the dirt with it a few times. “Rocky,” he says to me, “Just in time. You still got your wad?” he asked.</p>
<p>I felt in my pocket. I’d only lost thirty bucks on the coin table and still had about nine hundred to spare. I could barely take my hand from my pocket without it falling. “Yawmp,” I said.</p>
<p>Grandpa Storms coughed until his eyes watered, coughed until he beat his chest and his heart went back on rhythm.</p>
<p>“Jesus. You allright,” someone asked.</p>
<p>“No,” Grandpa said. “But I’m still playing.”</p>
<p>The orange flash of the bonfire lit Grandpa Storms’ face. He leaned over like his stomach had gone weak. Gerry Dekryger watched his stack, the last remnants, two-hundred at most, as Grandpa watched the air, not the willow trees or the card table, his eyes wider than Croton Dam which stayed fixed on nothing.</p>
<p>“Hey, Ticket Girl,” he said. “Come over here.”</p>
<p>One of the kids with a change belt came over, her dirty rainbow shirt about three sizes too big.</p>
<p>“You’re a Vincent, aren’t you?” he asked. “You’re momma drove bus for a long time. Didn’t she die driving that bus?”</p>
<p>“Hey, now,” Gerry said.</p>
<p>The little girl nodded.</p>
<p>“You’ve been doing a good job tonight,” he said. “And you’ve put up with too much. Or let’s say enough.” He took up the rest of his stack and handed it over. “That’s for you,” he said.</p>
<p>Gerry Dekryger slapped the table. “I ain’t won yet,” he said. “C’mon. Gimme a chance to win.”</p>
<p>“Easy,” Grandpa said. And just as Gerry was about to stand up, jump over the table to snatch him by the rabbit collar, Jay Hicks’ voice squealed over the microphone.</p>
<p>“AND NOW IS THE TIME,” he said under the beams of the moth-light. People stopped, listened; even Gerry eased away from the Euchre table. “If you look to your left we have the Grand Finale. I’ve been working on this baby a long time and here she is. So Double Down. Someone’s about to get rich if you got the guts.”</p>
<p>From the shadows of Ash trees they wheeled the contraption: Cousin Lou and the change girls pushing, digging in their feet and shoving like finding something pulled from the deepest mud. Its wheels squeaked as it moved over the grass. A blue tarp strained over an enormous wooden bowl made of two-by-twos and bolts and bungee straps. Water sloshed like a hundred hot tubs. The girl in the rainbow shirt darted over and helped with a final shove as the wood strained and the entire contraption rested under the willow tree, a thick rope dangling from the strongest branch above it.</p>
<p>“Rocky,” Grandpa said to me. I could only twitch. I didn’t have time for anything else. He yelled, “Rocky boy has nine hundred on it.”</p>
<p>The fire popped and even the river kids perked up their heads and looked at me scratching my neck.</p>
<p>“Okay. We already have takers,” Jay Hicks said. “But if you allow me to finish, what we have here ladies and gentlemen is a Jay Hicks Original. Well,” he said with his wife standing by his side, “Lady Hicks had the idea. I just had the hands. The material from Hank’s scrap heap.” Jay shot a can into one of the can buckets. “The longest anyone has lasted is five dunks, but it’s up to you how long you last, how long you can hang, as Lady Hicks, says—and the wagers are on the table.”</p>
<p>A log dropped in the fire. “I’ve got fifty on that,” Cousin Lou said from the picnic coolers.</p>
<p>“Put me in for thirty,” Angel Rojas said from the concession window. And then Brian Earl in his jean coat. And then Stacey, and then Dave Burkle the mechanic. Even the Vincent kids put theirs quarters on the table after a small tug-of-war over plastic bags.</p>
<p>From the woodshed two ladders were hurried over and set apart next to the contraption. Slapped across their tops were two painters’ planks. “There you go,” Jay said. “Flip that one over.” One of the change kids climbed up, flipped it, went onto it, snatched the rope that hung from the tree and a pulley system, and then threw down one of the rope ends where it thumped to the ground. “And now it’s time for the wager,” Jay Hicks said. “Rocky Storms,” he said to me. “How long do you think you can last? “Three? Four? Maybe seven if you have it in you?”</p>
<p>Of course I didn’t know what to say. “You got this, Rock,” Grandpa said from somewhere. I tried to believe in it, the wager in itself as if whatever I said would come true, but when I said it I wasn’t exactly sure where it came from.</p>
<p>“What’s the record?” I asked and scratched my neck.</p>
<p>“Five,” Jay Hicks said. “And Dave Burkle almost died tying that. So don’t go too nuts.”</p>
<p>“Make it seven,” I said, maybe not thinking, maybe not worrying or wondering what might be best, or where I’d stand amongst a million outcomes. The drummer of the band did a roll on a pickle bucket as I climbed the ladder and lay down on the planks. Above me the willow branches swayed from the wind. My feet were tied with the rope that felt like hard twine, something for a small horse or to keep a mean dog from chewing through and wandering. They pulled and hoisted, Cousin Lou and Gerry Dekryger, arguing about who was stronger and who had the best foot position. “Fine. Your skinny ass wants to be the anchor. Be my guest.” They yanked. My feet rose. And then again and again until I was finally suspended and looking down at the tub of water with dead leaves and a beer can floating along its edges.</p>
<p>“You ready, Rocky,” someone asked.</p>
<p>Bodies were upside down and they’d turned to something like shadows from the yard light behind them.</p>
<p>“Ready,” I said.</p>
<p>“And on the count of three. One, Two, …”</p>
<p>The rope loosed, and before I could catch my bearing of being submerged they hoisted me back out with water stuck up my nose. I coughed it out and noticed blurry black and yellow shapes and smelled smoke.</p>
<p>“Again?” a voice asked.</p>
<p>“Again,” I spat.</p>
<p>They let go; I dunked twice, and then three times, and then four, until I didn’t know the timing, just spitting or blowing bubbles, or when to open my eyes and be safe and finally say I’d won. Of course in my life I thought of what it’d be like to drown, a warm crawling into bed feeling after the last gasp.</p>
<p>“Okay?” they said.</p>
<p>I had my thumbs up, the international sign for keeping the shit rolling. “Okay,” I kept saying, maybe under water, maybe until all of the shapes turned into a blurred mass of yard lights and smoke. “Okay,” I said again after rising and spitting. “Okay,” but winning or not, for as long as they kept at it, for as long as the pulley squeaked and my shoulders splashed and the lights faded, I felt, for everyone along the river, I’d be putting up for those who’d spent their entire lives trying to remember, like strange dreams fading after long mornings, what it was like to come out on the winning end when a million forces told us otherwise.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Muscles tighten, noosing my neck to my rump, and this from a car wreck my husband says could not have caused such an ache. He’s the one suggested the swimming so my husband has only himself to blame for the backstroker eyeing the hairs lapping the edge of my swimsuit. Next thing I’m in the changing stall helping the backstroker tug the swimsuit down my hips.</p>
<p>“The rabbit was tranquilized for the bath,” said the animal technician, whose hands seemed to know better uses for such pets. “Otherwise panic, maybe drown.” He drew up my rabbit’s scruff, placed needle flush to the skin, plunged.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t hurt,” I said before he could, thinking what came over me in the pool — leaving waters where pain had no hold to do such a thing with a backstroker?</p>
<p>“Why can’t the doctor dispense the medication?” Marty said as I lined up syringes alongside my swimsuit draining into the tub. “I don’t do needles.”</p>
<p>I said, “When you see that bill.”</p>
<p>“Shoot him after. We’ll be late for the party.”</p>
<p>I asked around at the party if anyone knew how to give an injection. The great nephew of the birthday girl told me to pinch a flap of skin before sticking the needle. “Sometimes you hit a nerve anyway.” He tenderly patted his hip, where daily he injected insulin.</p>
<p>“Can I see?” I said, tugging up his shirt.</p>
<p>The great nephew grinned with slitty, stoned eyes, old enough to think everything was a game.</p>
<p>All through the song, the birthday girl’s husband never took his eyes off his wife. The flames of 80 candles undulated above the Olympic-sized cake. Yellow licks of light shone against the great nephew’s wet lips.</p>
<p>“Come home with me?” I said to the great nephew. “To inject my rabbit.” Plates got passed around, and my fingers forked up cake and pressed it against his closed mouth, frosting it aquamarine. I was willing to clean the mess with my lips, anything to avoid antagonizing my rabbit. It hurt that bad.</p>
<p>“Need a napkin,” Marty asked the great nephew, bringing a stack against my mouth.</p>
<p>The rabbit’s a friendly bastard but he sensed queerness in me, which he mistook for fear. Kneeling on the bathroom tile, syringe in hand, I was Nurse in a child’s game. There was a raw teardrop-shaped target on his neck left by the sickness. My finger stroked his veiny ear until I was out of what felt like patience — but was probably nerve — and discharged the syringe.</p>
<p>Toothbrush vibrating, Marty watched the prick of blood swell into air as the rabbit sprung out of my grip. Droplets of tawny fur splattering the floor.</p>
<p>I crawled under the sink after the rabbit. Marty spit out toothpaste before lifting a leg to let me pass. I pinned the rabbit’s head with one hand, the other hand aiming the needle for the nape — where was the third hand for pinching skin? — when the rabbit slithered belly out from under my palm, flashing dirty furred soles.</p>
<p>He crouched behind the toilet, thump-thumping his hind leg, alerting other bunnies that danger’s afoot. I popped my fist into its rump, and he walked out dog-style from behind the tender porcelain. I shoved the rabbit into the V of my legs. The time for stroking had come and gone. Thin grunts crackled up his throat. I pulled up the muscled jaw, needle-tapped the scruff, stuck, blood dotting, and entered.</p>
<p>“Leave him alone,” Marty said as he kicked crap balls the rabbit let fly the instant I hit maybe a nerve.</p>
<p>Motorized by pain, the rabbit bounded off tile, the loaded needle flapping from a neck the technician said was not so sensitive.</p>
<p>Birthday cocktail flooded my throat. “We could use that nephew who shot shots.”</p>
<p>“You sure could.” Marty shut the door behind him.</p>
<p>There is something about knowing you have caused the pain that makes you the shit that can follow it through. I snatched up the syringe from behind the toilet.</p>
<p>Marty said that all night he’d been thinking about ways to restrain our rabbit for this morning’s injection. He came up with this: set the rabbit in a shoebox then wrap and fasten with a cord. “If he can’t fight,” Marty said, “he won’t get hurt.”</p>
<p>The rabbit and I met again in the bathroom. It hopped out to greet me, not knowing that I was meaner than pain, and that was what it took. Marty’s shoebox idea guided me to the bathtub, where sunlight from one narrow window fingered the swimsuit stiffening there. Held in by four sides and me, the rabbit could only widen eyes as I pinched up skin at the hot target behind the ears and poked in. I hit the plunger. This time the rabbit just shook his ears, throwing off a bad thought.</p>
<p>“You did it so fast?” Marty said when I plodded out.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t take the blame last night,” I said.</p>
<p>“That got in the way?”</p>
<p>The muscles in my back had shortened like leather cords in some desert torture. I would grow long again in water. As I tugged up my swimsuit, Marty handed over the bag but his fingers gripped the mesh. “There’s other uses for those legs,” he said.</p>
<p>“Marty, my body responds to the water.”</p>
<p>Floaters strapped on backs, the old have come out in numbers today. I dangle my legs over the lip of the pool, watching their heads turn tranquil as water. In water the body can cheat. These swimmers know this as they eye each other across lanes, remembering better uses for hips than straining over porcelain seats, believing, still believing, even after all those laps, that infidelity is balm.</p>
<p>I haul my legs out of the water. The time for stroking has come and gone. The rabbit will get hurt, but at least he can put up a fight.</p>
<p>Pain, Marty, is the shit that will get us through.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Metal screeched, the chittering birds stopped, then a thump: her bear, in the garbage that she’d dragged out to the road less than ten minutes ago. Bonnie grabbed her shotgun and hurried to the front door. At the end of her long driveway, trash trailed from the tipped-over can across the grass into the woods, the C-cure lid wobbled by the big oak, but her bear was gone. She fired skyward. Even if she got a bead on him, she would never shoot him. She and he—she was sure her bear was a he—they were engaged in a long-term game of mutual attention and respect. When the shotgun’s echo died, she righted the can and gathered the debris as the garbage truck rumbled into view at the bend in the road. Eleven o’clock, right on time.</p>
<p>Lenn jumped from the cab, re-tying the bandanna around his neck—he thought he looked sexy—and said, “He’s a sly one, that bear. You got the best can, best lid, these things”—he batted the useless bungee cords as he dumped her garbage—“and you keep it locked up. Only thing left is to quit making garbage.”</p>
<p>“Us humans, we make garbage, but I’m doing my best. Does he get into the Levitskys’ or the Nelsons’?” Her neighbors up the road, whose houses weren’t visible, even in the winter when the deciduous trees were bare.</p>
<p>“I’d say Mr. Bear likes you, Miss Bonnie. You got that special, single woman thing going.”</p>
<p>“Come on, Lenn.”</p>
<p>“Fancy cheese wrappers, smoked trout, maybe, nice smelling shampoo and body wash.” He stretched out “body wash.”</p>
<p>“Give it a rest, Lenn.” Lenn, married, with six kids under ten, was the island flirt.</p>
<p>“You get scared of Mr. Bear, you call me.” He mimed phone-to-ear as he jumped back into the cab.</p>
<p>“I’ll call Vardeen first.” His wife.</p>
<p>“Spoil sport.” He laughed and waved as he drove off.</p>
<p>That’s what Bonnie loved about this place: everyone had a take-it-in-stride attitude. Bear in the garbage. Bats. Mice drowning in the bucket under the leaky sink. Snow-bound winters. Frozen pipes. <em>Nature rules</em>, islanders said.</p>
<p>She’d moved north to the island two years ago, after her mother died and left her twenty thousand dollars. She’d wanted a new life, far from her kids, her crummy job in the county clerk’s office, and her mother’s depressing house on Chicago’s north side, which she’d also inherited, and where the kids, or at least Sadie lived, and where Milo came to recover each time he messed up. Training racehorses in Florida, he knew nothing about horses; organic farming in Missouri, a pot farm, probably, where the farmer refused to pay him, so he said; living on the beach in Kauai, where he panhandled for food. Milo had taken so much out of her. Sadie, too, always thinking she knew better than Bonnie how to do just about everything. A different life, that’s what Bonnie wanted, and some distance. The island, a day’s drive from Chicago, but a million miles away, was no vacation destination. Working quarries, managed forests, three taverns, the gas station/grocery store where she worked part-time, a post office, a medical clinic open one afternoon a week, all near the ferry dock. The only paved roads led from the dock to the quarries and the gated entrance to the forest. She bought a house eight miles out on a dirt road and, in the first six months, had been frightened by every sound. She bought a .410 shotgun, took lessons, practiced with soup cans on the stump out back. She learned to chop wood, plow her driveway, and thwack a scythe through the brush at the edge of the ever-encroaching woods. <em>You don’t fight back, the woods will reclaim your place in a year</em>, that’s what everyone said.</p>
<p>She set her shotgun on her kitchen counter and walked toward the sliding glass doors that overlooked her deck and the woods beyond.</p>
<p>She’d seen the bear just once. A sunny day. She’d been standing at these glass doors, and a black shape, big as the meat freezer in her garage, glided through the un-mown grass between her deck and the edge of the woods. The upper edge of the thing, a moving line, head and spine, she realized later, glistened with sunlight, even though the shape was so black that it looked like an inexplicable gap torn in the familiar. When it was gone, she understood it had been a bear. She waited for him to reappear, wanting to feel again the eerie thrill of his presence, but for days, she’d been too scared to go into her backyard. <em>You got nothing to fear from bears, if you’re no threat,</em> everyone said.</p>
<p>She touched the glass, watching the woods. That’s where he was now, maybe watching her.</p>
<p>The phone rang.</p>
<p>“Mom, what are you doing?” Sadie.</p>
<p>“My bear’s been in the garbage again.” Bonnie fixed her eyes on the aspens behind her target stump.</p>
<p>“Listen, Mom, I need to talk to you. It’s about Milo.” Sadie always spoke about her brother in a superior, big sister way, although they were only a year apart. Twenty-seven and twenty-six. Irish twins, Bonnie’s mother had called them, disapproving of two births so close together and Bonnie not married. Blaming Sandro for that, and for hijacking Bonnie to the godforsaken farm in Ontario. And blaming Bonnie, forever, when Sandro deserted her.</p>
<p>“Mom, promise me you won’t look up what Milo did on the internet.”</p>
<p>Milo on the internet? Witchy fingers threaded through Bonnie’s gut. “I don’t have the internet,” she said, keeping her voice calm. “A storm knocked out my connection.”</p>
<p>Sadie told her to sit down. Bonnie lied, said she was sitting as she remained at the sliding glass doors watching a dragonfly big as a hummingbird land on the coffee mug she’d left out by her deck chair.</p>
<p>“Milo’s been arrested. Eleven felony counts so far.”</p>
<p>Bonnie closed her eyes and pressed her forehead to the glass. Was he dealing again?</p>
<p>Sadie talked about a van, a rental van, Nashville.</p>
<p>“Nashville?” Eleven felonies. How could that be?</p>
<p>“He thought he’d get into the music scene.” Sadie paused, waiting for Bonnie to say something. When she didn’t, Sadie went on. Milo didn’t have a credit card. You need a credit card to rent a van. He got angry, beat up the guy, took keys, stole a van, crashed into a Payless shoe store, broke into two houses, then beat up an old man. “He kicked an old man, Mom. Milo kicked an old man walking to church on Sunday morning.”</p>
<p>Sunday? What was today? She looked at the calendar on the pillar near the kitchen, trying to breathe. It must be Tuesday. Why hadn’t Sadie called her sooner? Needing air, she slid open the glass door. The dragonfly was gone. Birds cried, two of them, call and response, and the wind ruffled the aspens. Any light breeze could set the aspens dancing.</p>
<p>“Where is he now?” she asked. Her blue-eyed boy. Eleven felonies. This wouldn’t be like the time he stole the car. She’d gotten him off, but then he was sixteen. Or the time he lit a fire in the psych ward, when Bonnie’s attorney got him off by threatening the hospital with a negligence suit.</p>
<p>“The police have him. In Louisville.”</p>
<p>“Louisville or Nashville? I thought—”</p>
<p>“He was <em>going</em> to Nashville. Mom, are you getting any of this?”</p>
<p>“Where are you?”</p>
<p>“At home. Milo called me.” She meant, <em>You’re his mother, he should have called you. </em></p>
<p><em> </em>“What was he doing in Louisville?”</p>
<p>“Good god, Mom. He’s been living in Louisville for six months.”</p>
<p>Bonnie didn’t even know where her son was living. The last time they’d talked was two months ago, maybe more. He’d phoned to ask for three grand to buy a couch. When she’d protested, he’d said, “This is a fresh start.” How many times had she heard this? “Great,” she remembered saying, she always tried to stay positive, “but why do you need a three thousand dollar couch?” Then he ranted. She didn’t understand, she didn’t care. How could he make something of himself if he lived in a homeless shelter? No, he wasn’t living in a shelter. He’d found an apartment. He was applying for jobs. Why couldn’t she see that he needed nice things? She asked if he was taking his meds. He hung up. She’d been worried but persuaded herself he’d call when he was ready. Not hearing from him was good. He was, after all, twenty-six.</p>
<p>“I’ll drive down,” she said to Sadie. “Tell me where to go. I’ll see what can be done.”</p>
<p>“Come here. We’ll go together.”</p>
<p>Bonnie said she’d catch the first ferry in the morning and arrive in Chicago around three, three thirty. After she hung up, she closed the glass door, shutting out the bird sounds and breeze, feeling as if the lid had been lowered on her coffin.</p>
<p>She phoned RJ at the store. Could he find someone to cover for her for a few days, maybe a week? Family emergency. Sure, he could make do. He was shaking his head, Bonnie knew, commiserating. Everyone here was kind.</p>
<p>In the closet behind her suitcase she saw the box storing the old videos. The player was long gone, but she hadn’t thrown out the tapes. She didn’t need to play them to remember.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The video opens with a green swath, the grass in her mother’s back yard. Bonnie is holding the camera. The image tips up to find a blurry Milo squatting beside the sandbox while Sadie’s four-year-old voice squeals at Bonnie to hurry. <em>A frog.</em> <em>A frog. </em>The picture bounces as Bonnie hurries toward Milo with Sadie’s hand entering the frame to wave her forward. <em>Don’t touch it. Mommy’s coming.</em></p>
<p>*</p>
<p>In late afternoon, after she’d packed and put up the storm windows, a job she’d planned for next week, she heard a car in her driveway. It didn’t reverse out. She went to the window and saw a dark sedan with a heavy man standing beside the open driver’s door. Wanting directions? Interested in buying her black walnut trees? He lifted his hand to shield his eyes from the low sun and hitched his shoulders in a familiar way. Sandro? Sandro, thickset and old? She’d never imagined him aging. She ducked back—he couldn’t have seen her—and reached for her shotgun. Edging close to the window again, she watched him straighten and turn slowly to shut the car door. What was he now, fifty-six? Twenty-four years ago was the last time she’d seen him, when he’d put her and the kids, Milo still nursing, on the train south to Detroit, then on to Chicago, to stay at her mother’s. He was to join them in two weeks, after he helped Clary sell the livestock and ready the farm for winter. When he didn’t come and didn’t come, Bonnie had believed he’d been hurt or kidnapped or lost his memory, was wandering in some urban hell or locked up in a charity hospital or a jail cell. When Clary finally answered the phone, she said Sandro had taken his share of the livestock proceeds and left, saying something about Vancouver. “But he’s supposed to come here, to me,” Bonnie had protested. After an interminable silence, Clary had said she didn’t know anything about that.</p>
<p>Now here Sandro was, standing in her driveway looking at her home. Jeans, dark shirt, boots, much the same, but heavier, his hair, dark and long-ish, like he was still trying to get women.</p>
<p>She propped the gun against the doorjamb, in reach—she wasn’t going to make a fool of herself—and waited. At his knock, she opened the door. “What the hell are you doing here?”</p>
<p>“Hello, Bonnie.” The maritime accent she’d forgotten.</p>
<p>She shocked him, she could tell, even though his expression didn’t change. Had he expected the smooth-faced, compliant girl she’d once been? Now her skin was freckled and her brown hair salted with gray and short, no longer twisted into a braid that reached to her waist. Not bad for forty-eight, but she wished she looked better, to make him regret, and was furious at herself. Behind his thickened face—he probably drank too much—she could make out the ghost of the younger, handsome Sandro, ready to charm.</p>
<p>“What the hell are you doing here?” she repeated, holding the door. What she’d planned to say to him if she ever saw him again, the complaints and questions that she’d rehearsed and refined over all those years in the back bedroom of her mother’s house, adding new charges as the kids got older—and he not there—all that was gone. She had nothing to say to him, and she sure as hell didn’t want to hear what he had to say. The absence of explanation had become a comfort. The void of reason, that made sense.</p>
<p>He glanced at the shotgun in the shadows beside her. “You shoot strangers?” He was amused, she could see. A gun? She’d hated the guns on the farm, hated the fall slaughter, hated even the killing of hens for the stew pot.</p>
<p>“There’s a bear,” she said.</p>
<p>He nodded, uninterested, and studied her. He could look all he wanted and see nothing true about her. He inhaled and flexed his shoulders, as if preparing to say why he’d come. She crossed her arms to say she didn’t care.</p>
<p>“It’s Milo,” he said.</p>
<p>He knew. How the hell? She willed her expression to give nothing away. “What does that have to do with you?” Sadie must have found him. The damned Internet. Sandro wouldn’t have gone looking for them. Milo had to have been in on it, too. They, her children, had kept this from her. For how long?</p>
<p>“Sadie asked me to come,” Sandro said. “Believe me, I’m here for one reason only, for Milo and Sadie.”</p>
<p>“For Milo and Sadie? After not caring all the years when they cried every night for you.” Or when Sadie refused to go to kindergarten, or the year when the cool girls shunned her, or the time she broke her leg. Or when Milo had such a hard time losing his baby teeth and his one incisor never came, or when the calls from the school began and the run-ins with the cops, the drugs, the string of alternative schools, his dropping out altogether, the hellish business with the psych ward. “You know nothing about the kids. You abandoned them.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Milo looks up, his little moon face pinched with nervousness and excitement. When he sees her, he bends forward, picks up a lump, lurches to his feet, and runs toward her, his stubby legs churning. She’s knelt on the grass to steady the camera and waits. He holds the frog smack in front of his chest, so proud, clutching it with both hands. A few feet in front of her, he trips and falling, he thrusts the frog at her, the frog’s head filling the frame, its mouth stretched wide, shooting out red, gouts of blood, as Milo squeezes the life out of him. A plunge to green as Bonnie drops the camera to reach for her blue-eyed boy.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“Jeesuz-H-Christ, Bonnie.” Sandro ran his fingers through his hair in the way that had once made her melt. Her gut clenched. “Listen, we have to talk. Can I come in?”</p>
<p>She wanted to pick up the gun and bash his face, but she reached behind her with a stiff arm and closed the door.</p>
<p>“We can talk out here.” She didn’t want him in her house, looking at her things and making assumptions about her.</p>
<p>He stepped back a few feet, maintaining the distance between them, and peered up at the expanse of siding that she’d re-stained herself in the heat of July.</p>
<p>“This isn’t where I thought you’d end up,” he said.</p>
<p>His smugness infuriated her. “Sadie’s calling on you is pathetic and desperate. She’s confused you with a real father. Say what you came to say and get going.”</p>
<p>His nostrils flared. “You’ve got a rulebook, don’t you, Bonnie, a fucking rulebook. You’ve gone from being a needy, play-by-the-rules girl, love-marriage-baby carriage-rules, to a self-righteous… What’s the word?”</p>
<p>“Woman? Grown-up woman?”</p>
<p>“Christ. Okay, I didn’t operate by your rulebook, but there’s more than one way of looking at things. Don’t forget that. I’m here, right this goddamn minute, because you and I need to talk before seeing Sadie, and Milo. If they’ll let us see Milo.”</p>
<p>Us?  “Have you seen them in the last two decades?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>He turned away, his gaze traveling beyond the corner of her house to the woods. At the edge of her yard, behind the stunted pine she felt a presence. Her bear, she guessed, watching her now with this stranger. Had he felt Sandro’s threat?</p>
<p>“I’m not saying—”</p>
<p>“Not saying what? That you screwed them and me? This now, with Milo, has nothing to do with you. I&#8217;m driving down in the morning. I’ll handle it, like I’ve—”</p>
<p>“Do I have to say again that Sadie asked me to help? She asked me to talk to you and to come. I’m here because our children asked me. You better believe that you’re about the last…” An ugly red flushed his cheeks. He shoved his hands in his pockets and exhaled. “Sadie doesn’t need any of your shit making this even harder. When I got her call, I was on the road. She gave me this address, and your number, but I knew you wouldn’t pick up the phone if you saw my name.”</p>
<p>Sadie was a traitor.</p>
<p>He walked to the porch railing. “I have to get back to the Cities tonight, that’s where I live, but I’ll drive south by mid-afternoon, should arrive by late tomorrow at Sadie’s house.”</p>
<p>“The house belongs to me. That’s where I raised them, without you. My mother left the house to me.”</p>
<p>He said nothing, shifting to face away. She was being petty, that’s what he meant. That she’d raised the children on her own: that was irrelevant. She snapped her fingers. That was all any of it meant to him. At the sound of her fingers snapping, he turned, but she looked past him. Shadows had crept from the woods. Above the fringed top of the trees, the tip of the tallest spruce caught the slanting rays of the sun and glowed like polished brass. In there somewhere her bear was watching.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure if we’ll be able to see Milo,” Sandro said.</p>
<p>“Why couldn&#8217;t we?” Why had she said we?</p>
<p>“Bonnie, it’s cold. Can we talk inside?”</p>
<p>The wind had kicked up, swaying the grass beyond the porch. She shivered. A few times in the summer, she’d seen a trail of trampled grass circling her house, her bear keeping an eye on her. She knows where he sleeps: in the crushed ferns next to the tip-up, in the patch of broken Indian pipes under the beech, and on the far bank of the creek near her property line. Never has she seen any other sign of him, no scraps of her garbage dragged into the woods, no small half-eaten carcasses left behind. Her bear is immaculate. His life is clean.</p>
<p>She could sense him gazing at her.</p>
<p>Sandro shifted his weight, startling her. She said, “I’ll meet you at . . . Did you see that bar, right outside of town on the left, the Island Oasis? I’ll meet you there in a half hour.”</p>
<p>He locked his eyes on hers.</p>
<p>She looked through him, to what was ahead. The emphasis would shift from Milo’s disaster to Sandro’s arrival. The father returning to save the day would replace the disappearing dad. She would be the old grind; he would be the wondrous savior.</p>
<p>“I’ll be there,” she said to Sandro.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Off camera, Bonnie reaches for Milo to hug him close as the videotape records a tangle of grass. His flailing fists, his body fighting to twist away from her, his wild heart pounding against hers, all this goes unrecorded, as do his shrieks, “Don’t want you. Want my daddy. My daddy.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Sandro backed out of her driveway, the headlights switching on.</p>
<p>She walked through the house, the sight of her fat couch, the lamps she’d made from dairy cans, the smell of fireplace ash comforting her—she had created a whole new life—and imagined Sadie phoning to say that Milo had not done whatever he’d done, it was all an ugly joke, and she was sorry. Or Sandro might disappear again. Or have a heart attack. Or Bonnie could. She put two fingers on her neck and felt the pulse of her stupidly reliable heart. Then she brought in the mug she’d left on the deck, closed the windows, washed her face, splashing her shirt, not caring, and stuffed her wallet and keys into her jacket. Outside the night air was cold, crisp, and clean, the moon just visible to the east.</p>
<p>She had come this far to get away, and it wasn’t far enough.</p>
<p>Her boots caught in the grass as she walked past her target practice stump. If her bear were anywhere near, he would understand in the way that animals understand that she was no threat. <em>You got nothing to fear from bears, if you’re no threat.</em> She just needed a few minutes to breathe unsullied air. At the edge of the woods, she turned to look back at her house, her kitchen lamp shining through the glass doors.</p>
<p>At the Island Oasis Sandro would be settling in, a Black Russian in front of him, chatting with Lucien behind the bar, or trying to charm the deadbeats who hung out there in the middle of the week. If she left now, he wouldn’t have cause to check the time and think she was being difficult.</p>
<p>Brambles snagged her jeans as she stepped into the forest. Ahead, all was shades of black and silent, the small animals gone quiet. Even the dumbest creatures know to dive for cover when menaced. They couldn’t know that she was no menace. She held her breath. No wind, no rustling, no bear pushing through the underbrush.</p>
<p>In a while, Sandro would be annoyed. He’d mask that, charmer that he was, ordering another silly girls’ drink, or several, and in an hour, he’d realize that she wasn’t coming, toss money on the bar, and drive out here to berate her. No. He had to get back to the Cities. He’d phone Sadie, tell her that Bonnie had refused to cooperate, and Sadie would think, as she always did, that Bonnie was a lousy mother. Even so, they would expect her to show up tomorrow.</p>
<p>And she might. She could sleep next to the tip-up, where the moss was thick and spongy, and in the morning, brush off the leaves she’d used for a blanket. She could catch the first ferry.</p>
<p>Or her bear might come for her. Would that be so bad? To die? To be free of the entangling feelings that had snared her since Sandro appeared, since Sadie called, since Milo began screwing up, since the beginning? Her bear would be quick. Skin flailed, muscle torn, bones broken, pain, excruciating pain, but over in a flash. Then . . . nothing. Such ease it would be to feel nothing.</p>
<p>She was tired of it all, tired of human beings, tired of being human. Nearby the little animals began to rustle and click. What they and her bear had was what she wanted: a constant present, no past, no future, only this inhalation, this heartbeat, this moment.</p>
<p>When she didn’t show up in Chicago, they would . . .what? They would have to travel to where Milo was, angry with her, but not worried, focused on Milo. With Sandro there would they even need her? In a week, maybe two, Sadie would phone RJ and he’d call the cops. They would find her kitchen light on and her car in the garage. They might think she’d gone off with someone. They’d ask questions of the Levitskys and the Nelsons, they’d check with the kids who worked the ferry. When that came up bust, they would search the woods. Her boots, shredded clothes, keys, skull, shattered bones. A tragedy Sadie and Milo would be told. <em>Nature </em><em>Rules</em>.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, she stumbled forward, a vine grazing her shoulder, her eyes straining to see. In the distance a black patch broke free from the dark and thundered toward her. Branches thrashing, ground shaking, roaring everywhere in her head, veins, limbs, everywhere. She waited, terrified, eyes shut, hoping it wasn’t a deer.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>So God created mankind in his own image…male and female he created them.</em></p>
<p><em>                                                                                                                        -Genesis 1:27</em></p>
<p>Do not pity me.</p>
<p>It’s true my name is Lilith, known to history as the spurned first wife of Adam.  But what story is as simple as a single sentence?  He was no bargain, and let’s not imagine he didn’t suffer for the loss of me.  That woman Eve—you think she didn’t have a first love, too?</p>
<p>Among us all, only Adam was unlucky enough never to see his love returned.</p>
<p>My poor, cruel, inelegant, lonely Adam.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>So the story goes: I am Lilith, made of the same earth as Adam.  Made of half his soul.  Made of mud, bone, flesh, spirit, demon, word, story, stone, loss, longing, virtue, sin, forbearance.</p>
<p>Made of everything, except a rib.</p>
<p>The truth is, I don’t remember my creation.  I know only which tale I prefer: the one where God scooped me and Adam in his big hands, in his right the clay that would be Adam and his left the clay that would be me.  (Or vice-versa—God has no heart, so why fight to be closest to it?)  He clenched his fists, our torsos in his palms, and in the cracks between his knuckles Adam and I took shape: feet hooked on one side of his fist, chests heaving up between the second and third fingers, chins craning from under the thumb.</p>
<p>I remember the feeling, squeeze and relief.  Like birth.</p>
<p>Lilith is said to hate children—but only insofar as I know they’ll have to suffer.  Some of them will be Lilith, some Eve, some Adam.  Beloved, besotted, bereft.  I had no mother, after all.  Nor did Adam, nor Eve.  Maternal love is natural or it is learned; we had no chance to learn it.</p>
<p>When it comes to hate: I hate no more than any mother hates her reckless idiots, smiling at the hearts that will undo them.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>We were both Adam, at first.  Adam meaning earth.  Meaning man.  We had identical bodies.  God called us by one name, and we came.</p>
<p>It is history’s Adam who first suggested Lilith, in the smoldering dark with his hand cupped over the rise of my hip.  He sang to me, a wordless tune<em>.</em>  It was a way of calling me, but it wasn’t until later that I realized it could be my name: <em>La la.</em></p>
<p>My favorite memory of Adam is there, right there, the buzz of his throat against my throat, his thrumming music in my ear.  The leaves of paradise soft beneath us both.  His eyes like mine, his skin like mine, brown and rich and the same as the earth.  I couldn’t tell us apart sometimes, except I knew that he was singing and I must not be.  <em>La la.</em></p>
<p>“Who will we be when we’re old?” I would say, talking idly over his song.  “Will I become the one who sings to you?”</p>
<p>Love was different then, before choice.  It was the same thing as hate.  There was only one thing, and I called it that thing I feel for Adam, and he called it the same, and we had the gift of naming, and we named it love.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Of course, I didn’t know that at the time.  I talked myself hoarse to him.  He sang me the lullabies that lovers sing—but that is only because we’d named ourselves lovers and the songs lullabies.  We might have called them claws instead, and us foes.  Then we’d have been foes clawing at each other, nonetheless inside the melody of an easy sleep on hallowed moonlit earth.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>If I’ve stressed this name point strongly, it’s because I am angry at God for offering the wrong kind of language.  What we want are heartwords, mindsongs, but we were given only throatwords and mouthsongs to explain them to each other.</p>
<p>This is all to say that Adam and I loved each other, and I didn’t know love meant a different thing to him than it did to me.  I would not have asked God for a different Adam, not in a thousand thousand lifetimes.  But he asked for a different Lilith.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Here there’s been some misinterpretation.  We speak now of rib, but the truth is breast.  Both our chests once rose into the negative space of God’s fist; now, Adam’s went flat.</p>
<p>I like to think that this was Adam’s punishment.  God could have chosen another spot of earth from which to forge this second partner, but he made Adam hurt for her instead.  It is enough to make me trust God, for a moment.  Then I remember:</p>
<p>As God was reaching into Adam, to rip him open and undo my twin’s elegant body, I happened to walk into that bloody clearing with a handful of berries.  In later years, I have discovered that I hate the chore of picking berries.  I didn’t know it then, because I was picking berries for Adam.</p>
<p>And there was blood, and there was God, his arm in the base of Adam’s torn-out throat.</p>
<p>I screamed.  I raced to kill God, to protect Adam, and in his fright God pressed a finger so deep inside Adam that he pushed his organs out between his legs.  To this day, the womb replicates this accident: the baby starts off female: this was the form of humankind, before God the sculptor blundered in his shame at knowing what he was doing and being caught by Lilith.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” said God, “I’m so sorry,” and he placed Eve on the earth that had made me.</p>
<p>Her body was slick with Adam’s blood.  The grisly scene looked grislier because I’d crushed the red berries in my fighting fists.  In lonely years since, I’ve wondered whether I just wanted to be created again for Adam, too.</p>
<p>Adam’s skin was pale and glistening redly.  He staggered to his feet.</p>
<p>“Who said that you could do this?” I asked God, trying to reach him, to beat him.  God backed away.  He pointed.</p>
<p>I followed his finger, around which Adam and I had first gasped breath together toward our lungs.  I stared into my Adam’s muddy eyes, willing him not to have requested this other wife.  He looked guiltily at the ground.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Much has been written of the Garden of Eden.  Let me tell you something about Paradise: it is hellish as Satan’s memory, when the person you love there doesn’t love you.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Now, we invented new words: Passion.  Apathy.  Desire.  Disdain.</p>
<p>My hateful Adam adored her from the very start, with all the depth of love that he could cull from his hollow chest.  He trailed her through the paths of Eden.  He never sang into my ear again.</p>
<p>But here’s where the story gets interesting:</p>
<p>“La la,” Eve called in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>“Hush,” I told her.  I tried to take pleasure in Paradise chirping its night song.  “Hush, or Adam will hear.”</p>
<p>“La la hush,” she whispered, her breath buzzing at my throat.  Her mouth traced down my full heart and paused over the contained organs that Adam had lost to disdain me and desire her.  Her eyes flicked like a serpent’s up to mine.</p>
<p>“Lilith,” she mumbled, her tongue between her teeth.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Adam found out soon enough, of course.  There are few places to hide in a sprawling sunsoaked garden.</p>
<p>He hovered silently over us and I lay awake on my back, studying him.  The sheen in his eyes, I had learned, did not mean a thing.  It did not mean the same thing as the sheen in mine.</p>
<p>When he spoke, his lullaby voice was pitched low: “Do you truly hate me this much, Adam?”</p>
<p>Eve stirred sleepily against my breast.  I stroked her forearm with my thumb.  “That is your name now,” I told him, staring straight into the sun, avoiding the treacherous sympathy that would make me soft when I needed to be hard.  “I don’t want it anymore.”</p>
<p>“Then what should I call you?”</p>
<p>We’d had lovely nights together, he and I, cradled on Eden’s soil.  We’d had to call each other nothing, when there was no one else to call.</p>
<p>“Witch?” he said.  “Beast?  Adulterer?  Talk now if you’ve something to say.  Tell me.”</p>
<p>Beast.  I felt a painful swelling start at the base of my throat.  The story goes that Adam named them, the beasts of the field—but all it means is that he named me.  When he stopped wanting to sing to me, he started speaking, and his words were ugly.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to talk,” I murmured, wanting him to ask again.</p>
<p>He pulled Eve out from under my arm.  “You love talking!” he said.</p>
<p>Idiot boy.  What I’d loved was talking to you.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Adam sent me away from Eden, and I left.  It didn’t matter where; two loves lost, no place could be a paradise for me anymore.</p>
<p>Eve watched me go.  She watched my hips sway as I performed a steady gait away; she watched my calves sway as I couldn’t manage it.  She watched my cheeks burn as I looked back at Adam, and she watched my eyes fill as I saw him watching her.  She watched my knees buckle as I collapsed one last time into the earth of paradise, the closest I’d ever again be to Adam.  She watched me press my face into the dirt.  She may have watched me swallow a mouthful of soil.</p>
<p>She watched me right myself and leave the garden, but this was a time before knowledge: she could not predict where I’d go.</p>
<p>Eve was a brilliant woman, made of the best of Adam and me, and now she was a broken woman.  Her love went somewhere she couldn’t follow, beyond the garden’s gates—can you blame her for finding the forbidden fruit that very hour, and banishing herself where she might find me?</p>
<p>Brilliant, broken, brazen, brave.  These are words that Eve and I made up together.  These are our words, women’s words, words we chose for the beginning of a wandering world.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The story that comes next has been rewritten.  Of course it’s been rewritten; Eve is first woman because she was first mother, that’s all.  It is her sons and theirs who wrote the story.</p>
<p>Let me tell you: Eve didn’t care if Adam ate the fruit.  She left it in the sun to rot.  She was already halfway to the garden’s gate when he came running, spitting appleseeds.</p>
<p>I’m told that she did not look back to greet him.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Do not pity me, though I am Lilith, the scorned first wife of Adam.  I have had my years for pity.  I have taken the name given by the woman willing to take me.  I have not won, but I have not lost.  I have grown content.  I worry sometimes that my heart is turning cold, from lack of someone to give myself to, but then Eve wanders into me and I pour out as much love as I can before she leaves.  I redefine love by the day, the moment, the place I’m at in the story I’m telling.  God sometimes visits, to apologize.  I send him away.  It is not so bad.</p>
<p>A man’s word, pity.  If you must use it, then pity Adam, who could not learn to love what loved him: boneless Adam, broken Adam, Adam of the earth, Adam singing, Adam of the space inside God’s hands.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The chasm was a long grimace in the mountainside. It narrowed as it went deeper into the earth, but no one knew how deep it went. Three children huddled around the widest part of its opening, which was only a couple of feet across. Each of them wore either too little or too much for the weather. The sun was setting in the Wichita Mountains. Light snow flurries snaked along the boulders all around, and the wind sang low bottle notes into the rock fissure. From within its depths, a child’s voice pleaded for help.</p>
<p>“Let’s all calm down, smoke some cigarettes, and think this over,” Jared said.</p>
<p>“We’re not going to get in trouble if we get help,” Davida said from where she knelt at the lip of the chasm. She pushed her untended hair away from her face and stood. “We’ll be the good guys. So move your butts!”</p>
<p>“You’re the one who got him in there,” Jared said. “Don’t forget that part when you tell your mom.”</p>
<p>“<em>You</em> pushed him in there.”</p>
<p>“You wanted me to. Isn’t that right, Nathan?”</p>
<p>Nathan was silent. He always allied himself with the biggest kid, so he was Jared’s sidekick for their 7<sup>th</sup>-grade year. But Davida had gained something like respect when she’d brought a picture of her tattooed father to a show-and-tell and said that he’d committed suicide last year. She proudly announced that she’d inherited his “strangler hands” and held up her knock-jointed fingers to prove it.</p>
<p>Nathan mumbled something under his breath and looked past the jagged scrawl of the mountains towards the overgrown, bungalow-filled neighborhood where they all lived.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that right—Davida’s basically the one who chased him into that hole?” Jared pressed.</p>
<p>“You did go <em>on and on</em> about finding his ‘moon base,’” Nathan said to her.</p>
<p>“Because he acts like everything’s his,” Davida said. “He has like six bathrooms in his house.”</p>
<p>“Please help,” came the crying voice from the fissure.</p>
<p>“Benjamin, quit being such a wuss and just climb out of there before I karate chop your face in half,” Davida said.</p>
<p>The crying grew louder.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Down in the pit, Benjamin was angled headfirst into the earth, his arms pinned loosely to his sides, his feet over a yard away from the surface entrance. His bleeding hands scrabbled for purchase on the stone. Rock dust got into his eyes. He held his breath in his strain to push himself back out, but his matchstick arms couldn’t muster that much force. Triangles of fading sunlight penetrated here and there on the sides of the hole, making a patchwork of geometric figures interrupted by his frail silhouette. Distantly, from somewhere above and therefore seemingly “below” his upside-down feet, he heard Nathan, the smallest among them, grumbling and crawling into the fissure.</p>
<p>Then came Nathan’s voice: “Oh, jeez, you’re really stuck! You’re <em>f’ing</em> deep in there! Guys, come look!”</p>
<p>The awe in Nathan’s voice induced total panic. In a desperation that made the blood rush even more to his face, Benjamin struggled to free his arms. He got his right free and pushed against the sides of the cave to guide his body upwards. But his hand became slick with more blood and melting snow, and he slipped and fell a few inches deeper into the cave.</p>
<p>“Benjamin, why didn’t you just run?” Nathan whispered. “When she kept making us follow you, why didn’t you just run back home?”</p>
<p>Benjamin could hear Jared scoff aboveground. “Everyone quit panicking and smoke a cigarette. Then just pull the stupid fucker out.”</p>
<p>Benjamin felt a gentle pull at his ankles, but he didn’t budge.</p>
<p>“There’s <em>no way</em>,” Nathan whispered to himself and retreated back up the hole.</p>
<p>Benjamin tried to calm himself and think through his predicament. His father had gone into orbit around the moon and had taught him how to think through things one tiny piece at a time. So he first thought about his “angle of entry,” then about the necessary “counter force” to push back out, then about the gravity and “coefficient of friction” that held him in. He pushed against the sides of the rock, ignoring the pain from the splinters in his hands that he’d gotten when Jared threw him into some bushes before chasing him into this pit. He tried to use his legs but found he was only wedging himself deeper into the earth. He took deep breaths but kept his mouth barely open so the floating grit in the fissure wouldn’t get into his lungs any more than it already had.</p>
<p>“Guys, this situation is serious,” he heard Davida say, using the staid, reasoning voice of an adult. “I really think we need to get our parents.”</p>
<p>“I could just text my…” Nathan began.</p>
<p>“Oh, <em>I’ll</em> pull him out,” Jared said. “And I’m keeping your phones.”</p>
<p>Where Nathan could twist and turn into the fissure, Jared’s bigger adolescent body just barely fit. He slowly slid down the hole feet-first, getting bruised and cut along the way.</p>
<p>“Hey, man,” he whispered so only Benjamin could hear. “You don’t have to show us that moon base thingy you got. I’ll never even bring it up again. Davida was the one who was obsessed with finding it, okay. All summer long. ‘The moon base, the moon base. Let’s find the moon base.’ She’s such a little girl. Fuck her. I’m really sorry.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say, ‘Fuck her,’” Benjamin said and immediately felt ridiculous.</p>
<p>He felt two hands take firm hold of his ankle and pull. Pain electrified his flanks and ribs until he forgot all about keeping calm and screamed himself hoarse.</p>
<p>“Jesus,” Jared said.</p>
<p>“What’s going on down there?” Davida asked. “Are you being a dumbass, Jared?”</p>
<p>“Did you get him out?” Nathan asked.</p>
<p>“Why is no one smoking?” Jared shouted back. “Just look in my backpack. Three fat ones.”</p>
<p>“Please, it’s not like you brought pot,” Davida said.</p>
<p>“Jared, Jared,” Benjamin said. “I need you to go get my mom and dad. Now.”</p>
<p>“S<em>hhh.</em> Tell me what’s wrong,” Jared said. “Where does it hurt?”</p>
<p>To Benjamin, Jared’s voice was inappropriately sticky and warm down in the tunnel with only the two of them. Benjamin thrashed and fell a little deeper into the pit, driving his shoulder into a jutting claw of stone that arrested his downslide. He tried to keep still, but stillness only intensified the cold.</p>
<p>“It hurts everywhere,” Benjamin said. “My mom and dad won’t be mad at you. Just get them. I’ll make them pay you.”</p>
<p>“What if he has to pee?” he heard Nathan ask aboveground. “Will it like, drip down his stomach and into his face and stuff? That <em>f’ing</em> sucks!”</p>
<p>“<em>Eww</em>! I’m going to go get help,” Davida said.</p>
<p>But Jared called up to the surface: “They’ll only call the police! Davida? I said, they’ll only call the police. Let me try some more. I only gave him one little tug. Everybody relax.” And to Benjamin, he said, “Okay, I’m going to get you out for sure now. Just grow an extra pair and get ready.”</p>
<p>Benjamin pleaded with him to stop, but Jared grabbed him firmly by both ankles and gave his mightiest pull. Benjamin’s wild screams filled the hole, echoing up and down it, hitting all-new octaves. Dull molars of stone clamped down onto his back, bunching up the flesh there like coiled towels and jackknifing his vertebrae. “Stop, stop, stop!” he begged in between screams, but Jared didn’t cease his unremitting, full-bodied exertion. Benjamin heard things inside himself popping and pulled against his tormentor.</p>
<p>Finally, Jared’s muscles and resolve waned, and he let go. Benjamin’s counter pull rocketed him the deepest yet into the fissure, and he was sure that the jutting abutment of rock now pierced his flesh. Pain came blooming anew in his shoulder every few seconds, making his entire body tremor. His tears fell down an unknown depth.</p>
<p>“Damn dude,” Jared said as he crawled out of the hole.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Aboveground, Nathan was berating Davida, saying, “I’ve always known where his moon base was. I just didn’t want to show you because it’s nothing but his dumb rock collection out in the mountains. He tried to move some speakers out there so he could listen to music. That’s all.”</p>
<p>“How do you know?” Davida asked.</p>
<p>“My dad told me.”</p>
<p>At the mention of “dad,” Davida recoiled. “Liar,” she said as her dark green eyes aged in her pale face. “You don’t know where it is. No one does. No one’s ever found it. We’re going to be the first ones.”</p>
<p>Benjamin’s fresh round of screaming interrupted them.</p>
<p>“God, that sounds so nasty,” Davida said. Her disdain for Benjamin drew the group back together. Jared and Nathan joined her in peering into the hole. “It’s like he’s fucking a pig down there!” she added.</p>
<p>“Yeah, check it out!” Jared cupped his hand around his ear and leaned over the hole with a clown’s smile. “That is the sound of someone literally losing his mind. Give it to her, Ben. You show that pig a good time!”</p>
<p>“No, the pig is giving it to <em>him</em>,” Davida said with a crone’s smile.</p>
<p>Nathan made such a show of laughing that he fell onto the ground. His face was agonized with mirth.</p>
<p>“It just makes you want to leave him there for a while,” Davida said.</p>
<p>“Yeah, just totally bury him alive until he learns his lesson,” Jared said.</p>
<p>“And stops being so nasty!” Davida said.</p>
<p>“Don’t hurt that pig, Benjamin. That’s animal cruelty. Mrs. Nelson is going to make us write our senator again.”</p>
<p>He kicked some snow and dirt into the chasm. Benjamin’s screaming stopped. Jared kicked more down. Then Benjamin’s begging voice drifted up to them, and Jared started imitating it in a whiny way, “No, stop, please, <em>wah wah wah</em>!” He crossed his arms. “If I acted like that, my dad would kick my ass.”</p>
<p>Davida winced, and her face was full of loathing. “Jared, shut up before I karate chop your brain open.”</p>
<p>He stared at her, confused, as if she had violated some long-standing arrangement for no reason. Then he shrugged and said, “Hey, Nathan, I’m going to get the cigarettes out, okay?”</p>
<p>Nathan looked at Davida and let his gaze stray off towards the trees and boulders surrounding them. Davida fingered the rips in her jacket that she’d gotten from wrestling with Benjamin, when he’d refused to show them his moon base. She knew that last summer, Benjamin and his father set up the moon base somewhere in the Wichitas, and ever since, Davida had wanted to see something a father had built. But even when she held Benjamin down and Jared stood on top of his legs, he refused to reveal its secret location. Her hands and forearms still felt weak from the effort.</p>
<p>In the silence, Nathan whispered, “Maybe if we throw down a bunch of water, it’ll make it slippery, and he’ll be able to get out.”</p>
<p>“Or cooking oil from the kitchen,” Jared agreed.</p>
<p>“WD-40 from the garage,” Nathan said.</p>
<p>“Hey, I could get the sex jelly from my parent’s bedroom!” Jared said.</p>
<p>“Banana peels!” Nathan shouted victoriously. “Bunches, all packed in around him!”</p>
<p>“We got a lot to try,” Jared said, nodding. “We have a <em>long</em> way to go before anyone’s parents need to know.”</p>
<p>Davida looked at the sunset and the clouds riding in on a fast wind. It would be a cold night in the mountains. Benjamin had gone quiet again. She leaned over the rust-colored pit but couldn’t see him. The smell of desiccated leaves and winter flowed up from the fissure. Suddenly, she felt heavy with the knowledge of death. Death was standing with them over the cave, peering into its depths alongside them. In her dreams, her father didn’t know he was dead. Sometimes he’d come to give her a piggyback ride, and she’d have to explain again that he shot himself a year ago. He would look disappointed and then decay into a corpse in front of her. As she looked down into Benjamin’s cave, the heaviness of knowing death made her head bow lower, as if she were going to pray. She <em>was </em>the one who’d led the group to Benjamin, who’d scared him so badly he scrambled into the fissure to get away from them. And now, they both were stuck.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Darkness. His enemies had gone, and there was silence except when the wind made half-formed vowels in the fissure. He had never known such silence. He realized that until now, he’d never been truly alone, never truly out of reach of anyone. And the first thing he realized about this zero gravity of solitude was that he was no longer a complete person, no longer a Benjamin Spirer but just a voice that was not heard, a touch that was not felt, a force without Newton’s equal and opposite reaction.</p>
<p>Such fear seized him that he forgot who he was, so at first, the sound of his own name was nonsense.</p>
<p>“Benjamin?” That was a girl’s voice saying a recognizable sound. A special girl he hated, whom he’d gladly trade places with that very instant. This hatred, with its concrete immediacy, brought him back to himself.</p>
<p>“He’s down there, Mrs. Spirer,” Davida said.</p>
<p>“Benjamin?” called his mother.</p>
<p>Benjamin screamed for his mother, screamed until the blood engorged his temples, screamed so hard his exhale blasted grit into his eyes. The pain demanded that he rub the grit out, but his arms were stuck. This denial of instinct sent Benjamin into snot-producing convulsions.</p>
<p>“Honey, people are on their way,” she said. He could hear her trying to lower herself into the hole with him. “Firemen, doctors, everybody. Even Dr. Patel, the one who gave you the stickers.”</p>
<p>When Benjamin heard the ambulance’s sirens, he tried to have faith in America’s Professionals. Besides, his father the astronaut was among that group. Soon, there were several indistinct, new voices asking questions, of his mother and of him. “Do you hurt anywhere? Are you bleeding? Can you wiggle your fingers and toes?”</p>
<p>“Here’s a blanket I brought,” his mother said. “I’ll lower it down.”</p>
<p>“No! Don’t!”</p>
<p>“What’s the matter? You need it to be warm.”</p>
<p>The blanket slithered over his feet, enveloping his legs. It was a dark manta ray that was descending upon him, ready to cover him whole.</p>
<p>“Davida, make her stop! Davida!”</p>
<p>“Okay, sweetheart, okay,” his mother said, and the horrible thing was taken away.</p>
<p>Camera flashes lit the fissure around him until he heard his mother cursing as she never cursed in front of him. Searchlights turned on. White light filtered into the cave, stinging his eyes in the most wonderful way. Now he could make out what lay beneath him. Four feet below, there was rock bed the ashen color of the moon.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Davida watched the rescuers work by the searchlights. They camped and took shifts. They found a way to snake a tube of water down to Benjamin. The snow blanketed everything all around. The searchlights cast their glow far out over the Wichitas. Lichen-crusted, orange boulders and weather-blasted trees surrounded them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Spirer sat at the lip of the chasm and prayed as erosion tracks lined her face. She was a tall woman who never wore makeup. Her hair was purple and jagged, and she had a beautiful, freckled face. She covered part of the pit’s entrance with a blanket in a futile attempt to keep out the wind. She nestled herself a couple feet into the hole as if it were an egg-laden nest and made room only for the paramedics. Benjamin called to her.</p>
<p>“We can’t just drill down to him,” said one man with a hard hat. “The cave might collapse. We’ll have to drill around him, beneath him, and up to him.”</p>
<p>“How long will that take?” asked Mrs. Spirer.</p>
<p>“Hours. Days. We have no way of knowing how much is dirt and how much is rock beneath us.”</p>
<p>“How many drills do you have? I can pay for—”</p>
<p>“It ain’t about pay for. We got our drill here, and some military contractors out at Fort Sill are giving us two within the hour. By tomorrow morning, every nearby town from Altus to Ardmore will donate whatever they got, too. We’re going to get your son out.”</p>
<p>Davida crouched nearby, besides some bushes, and told herself she didn’t care if she froze to death that night. Someone draped a jacket over her shoulders. She resettled into her crouch. She didn’t know it, but she actually stepped into Benjamin’s moon base. Her very foot planted right next to his favorite stone, a big glob of granite and quartz that was pale like the moon. She hugged her arms over her knees and watched Benjamin’s mother. Davida cried unselfishly, keeping it to herself, not attracting anyone’s attention away from the hole and Benjamin. She felt something strange within her grow roots, something strange enough to withstand all of this terrible cold.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Benjamin thought about the temperature of space, about suns going out in the void. Maybe all the stars had frozen already but, traveling at the speed of darkness, their demise had not yet reached earth. Benjamin couldn’t feel his body anymore: his existence was entirely in his blood-engorged face. And now, across that face where his existence had coalesced like a centuries-slow droplet of water forming on the tip of a stalactite, something crawled. Hairy, unfamiliar feet made its way along his cheek. It inched towards his right eye, then paused. It walked towards his mouth, tentatively feeling along the skin. Some legs perched on his nose, and Benjamin imagined that the thing was going to cover his entire face and devour it. His father was not there to remove it. That was because his father was perfect, and perfection did not deign to intervene.</p>
<p>Benjamin tried not to sob, but he couldn’t help but let out a spasm of swallowed crying. This startled the thing, so it quickly made its way up his face, but with one back leg nestled in the groove between upper and lower lip. Benjamin had the impulse to quickly open his mouth and bite the thing’s limb off.</p>
<p>His mind lost focus, like a camera pressed too close to something. The thing started creeping up into his hair, curiously exploring with its forelegs. Eventually, he was never sure whether it was there or not.</p>
<p>Days. He’d been down there for days. He didn’t know how many. Even more than he wanted water, Benjamin wanted to know the time. His thirst for the time was unquenchable, and those above would not give it to him. He constantly asked for it. They constantly lied. According to some rescuers, it had been eight-o’-clock for hours now. Even his own mother betrayed him. It was never as late as it really was, he was never in there for as long as he really had been. Everyone above insisted on okay-ness, on you’re-doing-real-good-Benjamin!, on you’re-almost-out-of-there-Benjamin! He wanted people to be honest and say, You’ve been down there for half a week, Benjamin. We have no clue how to get you out, Benjamin. You’re going to die, Benjamin.</p>
<p>He could no longer differentiate sunlight, moonlight, and searchlight. The drilling got closer. Every now and then, someone annoyed him with questions like, “Are you bleeding anywhere?” But to these inquiries, he said whatever was expected so that they’d leave him alone. Every so often, a hand touched his ankle and a voice announced, “His pulse is still strong.”</p>
<p>Finally, he stopped paying attention to the world above. Even when the drilling was so near that it rattled his teeth, he didn’t much care. The echoes and vibrations barely disturbed him as he took his space voyages from waking to sleeping and back. He was ready to find new secret places, to build a new moon base that no one would ever be able to find. He struggled downwards towards the light below him, giving desperate pelvic thrusts, grasping the sides of the tunnel and pulling on its uneven surface. He slid and jerked earthwards, not caring anymore about being wedged too tightly or having his lungs crushed, inching along slowly until his right shoulder refused to go any further over that ever-present jutting rock that had been his personal demon for so long now. In his tormented contortions, he started to feel slick and smooth like a pink fillet. He cut himself everywhere, and the wounds acted like glands secreting a lubricating sebum. His shoulder finally slid past the claw of stone. He thought he would feel incredible relief, but he simply felt numb there. The numbness spread.</p>
<p>He fought harder. And then, with a golden satisfaction, he touched the lower rock bed below with an outstretched, dripping hand. He gave death throe twists.</p>
<p>Voices echoed in the rock chamber: “Hold on son!” “We’re going to go to the rock museum, Benjamin!” “You okay?” “We’re coming!”</p>
<p>He finally slid free and landed on the incredibly soft cave bed below. He was in a tunnel. Up ahead, the white light pulsed invitingly. He stumbled towards it and discovered that the glow emanated from a pool full of strange gems, each like a summer-blue afterimage of sunlight. He imagined the little lake was a watery artifact from the magical center of the planet. His thirst disappeared.</p>
<p>From the far side of the water’s edge, a female figure wrapped in a wet, bright white cloth glided over the water. She was completely encased in the clinging, translucent material. She was naked underneath, but this didn’t seem bad. She moved without disturbing her attire and without moving her feet. Benjamin grew heavy with sleepiness. The blindingly bright figure came closer.</p>
<p>“Shine that light down on him…”</p>
<p>“I’ve got to use the drill!”</p>
<p>“You’ll crush him!”</p>
<p>“I don’t have a pulse—I lost the pulse!”</p>
<p>“We don’t have time anymore. Benjamin! Let’s hear about your dad being a spaceman!”</p>
<p>Benjamin took the bright thing’s hand and found he could walk with her over the surface of the waters. She began teaching him a dance. He had never danced before. Her arms were strong and she kept his neck erect and held him tightly. His little feet kicked. Her hands were soft and warm, but sometimes she was so bright that he had to close his eyes.</p>
<p>Benjamin heard cheering and applause. He thought that he must be in a ballroom. His dance was impressive, and those were the sounds of approval. His legs dangled and wriggled, his head threatened to bob and sway, and his arms made lovely motions through the air. His partner was really Davida, the girl of his dreams.</p>
<p>“Bring him up here…thank God…oh God…move, move, move!”</p>
<p>“Is he breathing? Get the BVM over here.”</p>
<p>“Help the man…get the backboard and stretcher ready. Secure his back, Jesus you just pulled him out.”</p>
<p>“Had no choice—lost the pulse…”</p>
<p><em>Almost to the moon</em>. <em>Dad is probably there again by now. Except this time, he’ll actually touch down and walk on it, and this time, he’ll have a place for me, a campfire. And I’ll walk into the circle of its light and be there with him.</em></p>
<p>The woman of light wrapped her arms like a vice around Benjamin, leaned close to his face, and slid her tongue into his mouth. Benjamin had expected his first kiss to feel pleasant, but this was a strange pain. After her tongue went down his throat, she rhythmically breathed into him.</p>
<p>“Intubate him.”</p>
<p>“Got it.”</p>
<p>“Start the chest compressions.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>When they pulled him out, there was explosive cheering and bursts of camera flashes. The lights outlined Benjamin’s lank silhouette. A fireman held Benjamin as still as he could. The boy’s limbs dangled uselessly beneath him. His head and neck, which looked stretched out and unnaturally straight, were placed in a brace as soon as a paramedic could get to him. They laid the boy on the backboard and stretcher.</p>
<p>Davida shielded her eyes from the camera flashes as they took Benjamin to an ambulance. Interviewers descended upon the rescuers, who smiled unconvincingly at the cameras. Benjamin’s mother barged into the ambulance with her son, and Davida ran to its doors. As they swung closed, she saw Benjamin laid among white linens. The crowd applauded when the ambulance drove away.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Over the years, Davida took to wandering the mountains near the fissure. The town had fenced off the dangerous cave. People put delicate flowers for Benjamin on the rusted barbed wire. She often watched the morning sheen on the metal, the way it burned through the translucent petals.</p>
<p>At Benjamin’s visitation, Benjamin’s handsome Ivy League father had made all the kids laugh by showing that he could walk on his hands. He did this in the hallway of the funeral home, right outside a cold room that used to be a kitchen. Davida, not knowing what else to do, showed that she could walk on her hands, too. She and Benjamin’s father laughed together, but his laughter frightened her. She wondered where he’d been while his son’s life faded away in a hole.</p>
<p>Later, Davida fell extremely ill inside the showing room. Within the casket, whose plush inner cover was fitted with a canvas print of the American flag, Benjamin’s face was obviously absent of Benjamin. He did not “look like he was sleeping,” as some of the adults said. He looked like he’d left the building. There was an incredible <em>not-there-ness</em>. The corpse had nothing to do with him. She’d never seen a dead body before—her father’s funeral was closed casket. And yet, she still felt she hadn’t seen death firsthand. In Benjamin, there was merely the absence of life, which was something else entirely.</p>
<p>One summer, when Davida had begun to cut her hair short and jagged, she got curious while taking a walk near Saddle Hill. She wondered what was directly behind a thicket of trees off the path, near a table of rock. After the brambles cut her arms and face, after she stepped past the remnants of cigarettes that had gone unsmoked, after she forced herself through the interlacing branches, she broke free into a hollow depression on the mountainside. Her breath caught. For a fleeting moment, she believed she was on the surface of the moon.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I fell for Waylan while I was cleaning hotel rooms in the Badlands. People drove from all over with their families to see the dirt where dinosaur bones were excavated, and the museum where the skeletons get rebuilt. Waylan worked at a bistro that had a Mammoth Burger on the menu, and at 25oz of beef it was really too much meat for one serving.</p>
<p>I liked cleaning. It lets you see inner lives; how people treat the things they carry. Some rooms will be instantly marred with piles of clothes and musty towels on the floor, in others, clothes are folded neatly in the dresser, used towels in the bathtub, like the little cards with endangered penguins on them request. Guests trusted me. They’d leave money on the nightstand and I wouldn’t touch it, mostly because they had faith that I wouldn’t dare.</p>
<p>We made it work for a summer season, Waylan and me. I had my own room at the hotel, and kept it neat. By June most of Waylan’s belongings were in my place. He was sloppy and had the bumbling quality of a baby animal—a bear cub, maybe. I had a good feeling about him. He was a hardworking waiter and a minor pot dealer in town, so guests trusted him, too. They confided in him. At the bistro he got pulled aside and arranged deliveries, and then he’d treat me to dinner or ice cream. Our dates often felt like we were visiting Rome or Paris, with the tourists and all.</p>
<p>Once we went to the suspension bridge near sundown, and paused so I could take pictures of the painted Horseshoe Canyon and the deformed shadows of hoodoos. Then we stared for a while at this formation: the discovery spot for so many fossils, with dark bands of coal seams and stains deposited by the bathwater of history. Waylan rested both hands on my hips, his crotch pressed to my lower back. I let the desert wind gnarl my hair around, and felt one of his hands move to pin down my mane.</p>
<p>“I’ll never think of this place without you,” Waylan said.</p>
<p>“It’s our place.”</p>
<p>“Can I stay with you tonight?”</p>
<p>“Of course, I kind of thought you’d moved in.”</p>
<p>He nuzzled into my neck. The wind had calmed, he let go of my hair.</p>
<p>“What would you call this,” he said.</p>
<p>“A date, I guess.”</p>
<p>“No, I mean you and me. <em>This</em>.”</p>
<p>I turned to face Waylan. He licked his lips, which were so dry the saliva left a dark tinge.</p>
<p>“I’d call this a relationship, Waylan. Wouldn’t you?”</p>
<p>“I love you, you know that?”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>He kissed me hard and I got so overwhelmed by his love for me that we rushed back to the car to speed home to the hotel. Out of Towner traffic slowed us down. We passed by the Dinosaur Museum and I tried to count the people in line at the doors.</p>
<p>“I lost count at seventeen.” I said. “That place is like a funeral home.”</p>
<p>“The museum?”</p>
<p>“Orderly people waiting to remember the dead.”</p>
<p>Waylan laughed and put his hand on my knee.</p>
<p>“Maybe there’s a guest book—<em>Allosaurus we still miss you</em>.”</p>
<p>“<em>Dearly departed dinos</em>,” he said.</p>
<p>The drive back seemed like it took forever, as everything seemed slow with Waylan. I was impatient about him. I wanted every activity to fast forward since I was so excited about the possibility of what would come next. Waylan tried to convince me to enjoy the moment.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Towards the end of August, Waylan wanted to do something special, so we bought a tent and drove forty-five minutes south to the provincial park for a weekend getaway. We pulled in to the campground, which was empty. We found a good spot to pitch by the creek and popped the trunk.</p>
<p>I started slapping my arms while dislodging our cooler. “The mozzies are bad,” I said.</p>
<p>“You must have delectable blood.”</p>
<p>“Maybe I’m a target because there are no other victims to choose from.”</p>
<p>He started on the tent poles as I dug around for our bug spray. Soon he was bobbing and weaving, waving his hands around his head.</p>
<p>“They’re vicious,” Waylan said. “Let’s go register, maybe they’ll calm down in the meantime.”</p>
<p>We found a station and asked the ranger about the mosquitos. He told us there had been a flash flood the day before, and around here the critters take advantage of that rare opportunity to reproduce like crazy. The trails on the canyon floor were still sludgy and slick as yogurt. We were the only idiots there.</p>
<p>I kind of enjoyed the abandoned squalor of the campground but there were a few thousand too many insects to fend off for us to stick it out. We piled back in the car. Waylan drove and I was tasked with killing all the mosquitos that had followed us inside. By the time we got back to the hotel the inside of the windshield was a massacre of wings and legs and thumbprints of our blood.</p>
<p>Waylan must’ve taken this experience as an omen. By Sunday of that weekend, after we’d eaten our camping rations, he’d decided to break my heart. We were lying in a t-shape: my legs draped over Waylan’s hips, him across the bed the wrong way, head balanced in his hand. He said he was planning on giving everything up for me, but I didn’t understand what, exactly, he’d be sacrificing.</p>
<p>“You’re better off without me, babygirl.”</p>
<p>“Shouldn’t I be the judge of that?”</p>
<p>“Do you really trust your own judgment?”</p>
<p>“Sure I do. I chose to love <em>you</em>, didn’t I?”</p>
<p>“That’s my point,” he said. “You didn’t make that decision. I did.”</p>
<p>Then he decided I should leave. I locked myself in my room and washed my face for what felt like hours, hovering over the sink and splashing my skin with cold water every time a tear edged out of my eyes. I packed my clothes away in my shitty duffle bag and I stuffed plastic wrapped hotel soaps in the gaps. I looked for other two-time use items—shampoo, hand lotion—I’d make the tiny bottles last for weeks, same as I do with liquid soap, adding water to the remnants until there are no suds to be seen.</p>
<p>At the bus station I used the automated machine to buy my ticket. Eye contact was too much intimacy. Selected <em>single</em>, <em>one-way</em>. Lined up behind other travelers I held the paper against my mouth. Waylan, you’re lying to yourself, I whispered. He stayed in dino-central while I moved to the sprawling cowboy city two hours west.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Soon after, my belly started rounding. My breasts became tender and glorious. Stretch marks inexplicably asserted themselves only on my inner thighs, as though a creature with claws was trying to splay me open. I bought some comfy peasant dresses and noticed gentler treatment from the general public. Seats on the subway. <em>Go-aheads</em> in line. Panhandlers seemed to sense that I had nothing left to give.</p>
<p>I knew it was Waylan’s baby in there. I couldn’t bear to call him, it was too early, but I’d made the decision to keep it.</p>
<p>I met D at my new restaurant job. In many ways, he was the opposite of Waylan. Sturdy and reliable. He escaped Communism to be a first generation Canadian. Going by looks they could’ve been brothers, though. Next thing I knew I was staying at his rental house, which was peaceful and clean with easy access to the train station. Before I moved in, I made sure to ask D about his childhood, since I felt I could access his true character that way. When he was a kid he was an alien in school. Fresh to Canada in third grade, he couldn’t speak a word of English, so they enrolled him in remedial everything. Luckily, he met a boy from the same peninsula who served as his instant best friend and translator. Whenever I think of this story, I yearn for a friend like that, who could bring everything to me, pre-interpreted.</p>
<p>I made a habit of walking home from my waitressing shifts when it was dark. I figured I was safe—who has the stones to hurt a tired out pregnant lady? On these evenings I’d make my way through residential streets and search for windows with glowing TV light. I’d tiptoe across yards and watch what the people inside were watching. Rich people liked cooking shows. Most everyone else was on board with reality TV. At the top of our street, an old woman left the news on 24/7. Once or twice, I’d recognized <em>Planet Earth </em>videos: the night grew cool around me as I watched grazers on the African plains, living in peace before predators terrorized them. In slow motion, the screen displayed the most vulnerable being eaten by lions and then desecrated by scavengers. Then they’d repeat the montage in a different ecosystem.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>D took me on the sort of dates I’d never been on before—they were more like activities. We went on walks and to galleries; he probably assumed that as a waitress I was tired of restaurants. He would cook dinner and seemed to love coming home to me. After school he’d walk in and say, <em>Oh good, you’re here</em>, like he was a little surprised or suspected that I’d leave. He never said a word about the pregnancy, either, which made me feel like he loved me so much it didn’t matter that I was carrying someone else’s child. Some mornings I’d wake up in a cold sweat, nauseous, and he’d soothe me back to sleep as though untangling a nest of guilt in my chest.</p>
<p>Heading north on a bike ride, we waited at the intersection of 34th and Borden. I was on the red Raleigh D had bought me at a garage sale, one of his many kind gestures of encouragement to try new things. When the light went to green, the minivan beside us turned without looking and I veered right to avoid it. D was too near behind me. My tire slid and down I went to the pavement. The van screeched to a stop. D jumped off his bike and yelled <em>what the fuck</em> and threw the heavy Supercycle onto the hood of the van, pretty much stomping to the driver’s side window. His voice was raised but I couldn’t really hear what he was onto. I was still on the ground worrying about what was happening inside of me. My knee and elbow were scraped up with road rash and I checked out my hands and they were a bit bloody and shaking. I looked over at D—was he leaning into the open window? The driver was a pudgy man with salt and pepper hair. He appeared terrified and, I thought, sort of sweet.</p>
<p>A woman dressed in an elegant skirt and silky tunic came over to me as I stood up and relocated to the sidewalk.</p>
<p>“Are you all right? I saw everything.” She looked ready for a high-level office job or for church.</p>
<p>“I think I’m fine, thank you,” I said, embarrassed.</p>
<p>D’s voice was quieting down so I wasn’t sure what they were negotiating. I heard the word <em>man</em> a few times.</p>
<p>“There’s a lovely bakery right here,” the woman said. “Can I buy you a cookie or something?”</p>
<p>I was half listening to her as D pulled his bike gingerly from the van hood and rolled it over to me.</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s so nice. But no, thank you.” I said.</p>
<p>“Okay,” she paused, as though I’d robbed her of some chance to practice charity. She noticed my cleavage and empire-waist tank top, my curves. D slammed his bike as he propped it against the streetlight behind me. I recognized a flash of panic glitz into the woman’s eyes, then vanish as she took her leave. “You be careful out there, dear.”</p>
<p>The van peeled away and the driver called, “<em>Sorry</em>!” out the window.</p>
<p>“What a jackass,” D said, looking me over. He swept some crud off my shirt. “Oof, your poor hands.”</p>
<p>“D, that was your fault.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You hit me. The van didn’t even touch me.”</p>
<p>“You’re kidding.”</p>
<p>“No. You were so close to me that when I swerved you caught my back tire.”</p>
<p>D laughed a little. “Oh holy shit. Well, that guy learned his lesson, anyway.”</p>
<p>I told D that the fall spooked me, but that he should ride on without me and we would meet at home later. He reluctantly agreed. He pedaled off, waving at me without turning his head, or signaling a turn.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry I slipped,” I said to my stomach. “Everything will be okay.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The next day I got my start with the sound of glass breaking, the splash of liquid. Half asleep, I fumbled my way into the kitchen. D was on his knees with a dishtowel, pushing coffee around on the floor, letting out little yelps and yeeshes from the heat.</p>
<p>“Don’t walk, babygirl,” he said.</p>
<p>I was barefoot. Every man I’ve ever been with has called me <em>babygirl</em>. I don’t ask them to do it. Must be something I give off, the way some people just scream with their whole being to be called <em>buddy</em>.</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>“What does it look like?”</p>
<p>“Did you put boiling water right in the glass?”</p>
<p>D dropped his head and let it go limp. Like he’d given up on life.</p>
<p>“<em>Clearly</em>,” he said, “I have not even managed to have a coffee yet so can you please just go back to bed?”</p>
<p>I rolled my eyes as much as I could for how droopy they were at that godforsaken hour, spun around and climbed back under the warm duvet. I starfished my body out. That was three glasses he’d broken this month. If he would just make normal drip coffee this could be prevented. Who even drinks instant coffee by choice? Who doesn’t use a mug? D was waking up early for school. Correction: he was waking up for the possibility of school. He would sit at the table and wait in front of his phone for the supply list starting at 6am. A teacher somewhere in the district would call in sick most days, which was good for D, but on the other hand, you hear about kids and consistency. I dozed in and out of consciousness and heard D talking, then the rapid clamour of his work routine before the front door opened and slammed.</p>
<p>I borrowed D’s car to pick up a drive-thru breakfast and then found myself on the highway eastbound. I was pulled towards my old town and Waylan. Ditching the endless labyrinth of sprawl, the earth changed around me. The sky expanded, but the features grew more arid and lifeless the further along I got.</p>
<p>The bistro was slow when I walked in. Once summer is over the whole place becomes barren. Misty came out with a menu before she recognized me.</p>
<p>“You’re back?” She wrapped me in a rough hug.</p>
<p>“I was just in the neighbourhood.”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s good to see your face. You want a table?”</p>
<p>“Nah, I thought I’d pop by to see if Waylan was working?”</p>
<p>Misty bounced the menu against her hip. “He quit—end of the season, you know. He went home.”</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>She shook her head. “Not sure. His wife found a place somewhere.”</p>
<p>I could feel my face crumpling. “His wife?”</p>
<p>“He said he told you about her. I thought you knew.”</p>
<p>“Sure I did.” I straightened myself out.</p>
<p>“Well. He’s a smooth talker. His wife must be clueless, hey?”</p>
<p>“Must be. I guess I haven’t thought much about things since I moved to the city.”</p>
<p>“It stays the same out here, at least. So predictable.”</p>
<p>I thanked Misty, left, and drove to the less popular canyon. I wandered down to the coulee and thought how sad it was that I could never tell Waylan about the pregnancy. Married—that made me the other woman. What a guy. I chose to believe that he didn’t know what love was.</p>
<p>Up the cliff, I heard the loud rumble of an RV parking in the lot. A family of four got out and the kids held binoculars to their faces while the dad had a smoke. I waved at them and the little boy waved back. The odd thing about Badlands is that it’s impossible to gauge whether the route to the other side is five minutes by foot or an hour; the strange forms and slopes betray any sense of distance.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>I put the red rock I’d picked up for D on the dashboard. Whenever I turned it slid and crashed into the windshield corners. He might appreciate it. A pain curled into my side as I approached the city again.</p>
<p>In the emergency room I told the nurse what happened. She made me pee in a cup, which she sent off to be tested, and then asked a bunch of lightning round pregnancy questions while I tried to act normal in my paper hospital dress.</p>
<p><em>Six or seven weeks I think. Yes I missed my period. Yes my boobs hurt. Bigger belly—leggings only for this gal. Yes morning sickness. No I haven’t taken a test. Because my body is like clockwork and I wasn’t using, y’know, anything</em>.</p>
<p>The nurse nodded and jotted all of this down on a clipboard, then left to find the doctor. While I waited for the doctor I put a hand on my paunch. I studied a poster on the wall of a full-term pregnancy diagram. Soon I would be grotesque. In the nature documentaries, the babies just seem to slip right out, a glistening mess, ready to run. I wondered if D would be repulsed or if my shape changed slowly enough he’d get used to it.</p>
<p>The doctor came in after a while and barely said hello before my feet were in stirrups and she performed an examination, quick and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“You can sit up now, we’re all finished,” she said. She frowned and peeled off her gloves. Looking at the chart one more time, she let me get dressed before positioning her stool in front of me. Later, I would recognize her odd bedside manner as awkwardness. She explained to me what phantom pregnancy was.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>I opened the door to D’s place and the TV was on. On the floor, there were tons of white, powdery marks, and their trail led to D in the rumpus room, stretched out on the couch underneath the bay window.</p>
<p>“Hey babygirl.” He kept his eyes on the screen.</p>
<p>“Hey. What’s on the floor, this white stuff?”</p>
<p>“Oops. It must be from my socks.”</p>
<p>D had been putting baby powder in his socks to keep his feet from getting sweaty at work. It was nerves, he said. I told him it was his Payless shoes that were not, in fact, real leather and did not let his feet breathe, but he ignored me. He claimed he’d wear them until they couldn’t do their job.</p>
<p>“I’ll clean it up later,” he said.</p>
<p>I flopped onto the couch beside him. On TV, a man was trying to start a fire with twig friction and simulating a broken arm in a dense winter forest.</p>
<p>“I borrowed your car.”</p>
<p>“I saw that.”</p>
<p>“Are you mad I didn’t tell you where I was?”</p>
<p>D shrugged. “I trust your judgment. If I needed to know you’d tell me, right?”</p>
<p>“Right.” I leaned into him, and ran my fingers over his downy forearm.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry about this morning,” he said.</p>
<p>“It’s okay.”</p>
<p>“I’ll use a mug.”</p>
<p>He looked at me, and brought my hand up to his face and kissed it.</p>
<p>I asked D about his day of teaching and drifted in and out of attention. Because he’s always a substitute, he gets to come in and be entertaining for his class. Sometimes they watch movies. Today, he told them mountain stories. Which ones, I asked. He told me the story about when he’d gotten lost on a hike. He and his father had climbed a peak in the Rockies late in the day. By the time they’d reached the summit, the sun was setting fast, so because they saw the road from the top they ventured a shortcut to get back quicker. They wound up following a goat trail and got lost. It was one in the morning before they made it out to the road. The police had been looking for them.</p>
<p>“Were you scared?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Not really. Just hungry. Maybe I would’ve been scared if I was solo.” He cracked his knuckles.</p>
<p>Is it harder to feel safe alone? I thought about telling D about Waylan, about the baby, but then he didn’t ask. Plus, I couldn’t picture him being pleased.</p>
<p>“Listen,” he said. “I have this recorded. Let’s start it over so you can see how he does it from the beginning. This guy is amazing. He teaches you how to survive. One sec.”</p>
<p>D jolted up and fiddled with the remote a while until he found the restart button. I felt relaxed. I asked D to press play and watched for a few minutes before leaving the room. He didn’t call after me.</p>
<p>On my drive back from the Badlands, I hadn’t worked out how I could’ve explained to Waylan I would’ve been willing to be a mother. Maybe something simple like, <em>Waylan, you’re a daddy</em>, and how can you argue with that. I pictured his reaction and no matter how I twisted it, he was thrilled. That is, if the baby wasn’t a phantom.</p>
<p>Someplace, Waylan was with his wife and the memory of me will be wedged in the middle of their timeline. I’d forgotten what beginnings feel like. Maybe like fireworks going off far away, when you confuse the echo for the source. Endings were what I got used to, what I looked for and what I’d been plugging away at predicting down to the minute.</p>
<p>I took a shower then wrapped myself in a towel while I scrubbed the tub, toilet, floor, and mirror until they sparkled. I dropped the toilet lid down and cracked the door. Steam escaped from the bathroom along with a waxy ammonia scent. In the hall, I strained to listen to the drone of D’s show. Though I loved TV, if scenes weren’t flashing in front of me the noise was real easy to tune out. I pulled a mop and bucket out of the closet and set to work. The footprints disappeared in wet streaks.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“It’s your worst habit.” She accuses him constantly, a waspish buzz to ignore: it’s the toothpick wagging between his teeth, or “Jesus fucking Christ” flying out even on Sundays, or letting crackers go stale with the inner bag left gaping open, or sleepwalking, or. “It’s your worst habit,” she says to all of that and to all the rest, a prissy smirk cemented on her face, and here it is tonight, already.</p>
<p>“Now, darling, how can they <em>all</em> be the worst?”</p>
<p>He hopes she’ll laugh, but she pauses, pondering as if it’s a test question. “Hmm, you’re right,” she says. “You’re absolutely right.”</p>
<p>It’s spaghetti at home, kids in bed, what passes for a romantic night here: sauce from a jar, thrashing out his bad habits. He pours another glug of wine for each of them, a nice Barolo he picked up earlier in the day—for his girlfriend but uncorked tonight in a moment of compassion for her, his wife, who begged him to etch this night into his calendar, begged him not to cancel, whatever came up. That explains the jar sauce, he thinks, that she bet against his following through, and how immensely proud he is for showing up.</p>
<p>He sips wine, eyes her across the table, her face framed between two flickering tapers. Says, “I’m being funny. Trying to be. Hell, you’re right. They’re all bad, all the worst.”</p>
<p>“Noooo.” She draws the word out long and low, a husky whisper, but there’s no more.</p>
<p>“I mean—,” he says. But what does he mean? He flicks a glance at his watch. Ten-thirty. Already half an hour late. But his girlfriend knows he’s always late, knows the exact amount of late that is his on-time. She knows him as well as anyone—actually, she assumes she does, which is what he wants from them, a comfortable simplicity.</p>
<p>His wife props the tines of her fork upside-down on the plate rim. So damn neat. No spills, no mess ever. “What are you thinking about?” she asks.</p>
<p>“How beautiful you are.”</p>
<p>She says, “That’s your worst habit, really. Saying that whenever I ask what you’re thinking.”</p>
<p>“But it is what I’m thinking.” He reaches across the tablecloth for her hand, and she allows him to take it. He worries his thumb over the diamond in the anniversary ring he presented last July. Ten years. Or, as she told him then: 3652 days, including leap years. “You’re not in my head,” he says.</p>
<p>“Thank god.” She laughs. Her turn to sip wine.</p>
<p>He smiles. He’s a rising politician, famous for his smile. They love his smile. He loves to smile.</p>
<p>“Opulent wine,” she says.</p>
<p>He’ll be fine. He’s always fine.</p>
<p>Then she lumps her other hand on top of his, squeezes so he can’t easily slide away. Her grip makes him abruptly aware of his own bones. She says, “I know you’re lying.”</p>
<p>In his head: <em>Jesus fucking Christ. </em>The tedium of it. To her he says, “It’s not like I’m breaking the law. Thinking one thing, saying another. It’s what people do.”</p>
<p>“What politicians do.”</p>
<p>“What we all do.”</p>
<p>He wants his hand free; he wants to cross his arms across his chest. He wants to leave. He sits perfectly still. He knows how to do this.</p>
<p>She says, “You’re thinking about her. You want to go to her right now, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>But he can’t outlast her silence, any silence. He never can. He jabbers, about her, the kids, the expensive ring on her finger, her. She sits pillar-straight, listening to each word. He feels like he’s delivering lines in a movie, like he deserves a fucking Oscar. He surprises himself when he says, “Goddamn it, you <em>are</em> beautiful. You’re fucking beautiful. Look at you in this candlelight, how you glow. I’m lucky to be married to you. That’s what I am, lucky.”</p>
<p>She releases his hand at that word, “lucky,” but he keeps his hand resting on hers to prove he can.</p>
<p>“Honestly, we’re both lucky,” she says.</p>
<p>He agrees. Profusely. So, so lucky. The sex is actually okay, even beyond okay. That husky voice she gets sometimes.</p>
<p>Later, he wonders why she called herself lucky. At first it’s mostly, <em>Damn right she’s lucky</em>. But later, late on a different night, driving to his office from a different girl’s condo, he gets it: She actually does know him. And he, stupid fool, didn’t even know that—until she told him so.</p>
