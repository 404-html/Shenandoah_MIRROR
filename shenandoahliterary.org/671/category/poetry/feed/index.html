								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<pre>—divination by auras

It’s Johnny Cash on the little boombox
I carry as we climb the grain silo ladders to get a bird’s eye view
of the town, of our dozen streets,
<em>then the father hen will call his chickens home,</em>

a little eschatology in the early evening—
&amp; you ask, <em>why divinations</em> a moment before

you press your hand to your head:
the town blurring on its edges, I know from past episodes,

like static breaking in, like the ghost chatter of phantom birds
on radar, the green flecks no one could explain
moving against the wind.

And the lights, every light begins to drift closer.
<em>Aura</em>, you say, quietly. A migraine coming.

Like reading the red sky at morning, the sailor’s warning,
or looking for tomorrow
in chicken entrails, tea leaves, casting locks of hair
                                                       when the I Ching goes missing,
as if your body had a handle on the what’s-to-come,
o Cassandra, o Isaiah,

your body somehow tuned to the turning of the days,
the way moths steer by the stars, or animals scatter
                                                     to higher ground
before the tsunami hits.
I never answered your question—it was reading the Inferno,
meeting the doomed one by one, being moved

by the damned, yes, because who amongst us hasn’t dreamed
a passion that would condemn us to a whirlwind
                                               of bodies,
but it was the fortune tellers that shook me—
forced to carry their heads in their hands with their gaze fixed
behind them always.
                       And for what.
Trying to look through the signs into
tomorrow. Who hasn’t looked to the stars

to see if someone’s coming back, who hasn’t seen a body
hovering between this world &amp; next
                                       in the monarch butterflies
rising from milkweed?
You would have laughed,
but all I wanted was to gather them once,
all those condemned sightseers,
because no father hen was coming to take them home.

Are there other windows into the future
your body can look into? Could you look long enough

to see twelve hundred snow geese falling from the sky over Idaho next week?

We begin to climb down, rung by rung, your eyes
closed, slow as Dante down the devil’s back.

Cars shake down Main’s cobblestones. A siren blares
in the distance. You might out-do the MRI,
find the invisible tear in a tendon, tease out

the names from the next round of pink slips.
Get us through the day. Steer us, get us

home, so there would be no pile of flowers in the middle
of the street. No boombox on the sidewalk, playing a loop

of the D.A. reciting charges
against the cops, over &amp; over.

We might know the hands on the litter that will bear us.
We might kiss those hands before we go.</pre>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Woods erupting<br />
With turkey tail fungi<br />
And Touch-Me-Not,<br />
You know this:<br />
The stream overflows<br />
And goes back again.</p>
<p>Going back again,<br />
Purple Judas trees open<br />
In clouds, the heavy scent of<br />
Bloodroot and unblinking<br />
Stare of Doll’s Eye<br />
Following gradually.</p>
<p>Following then<br />
That this is no-man’s-<br />
Land electric with nettles<br />
And the violent proof of burs<br />
That drop off eventually—who<br />
Traffics half-waterways?</p>
<p>Those who traffic half-waterways<br />
Under doves nestled like water<br />
In the crooks of trees know<br />
Minnows sew shadows to sandbars with needle<br />
Flash, the doves mourning for no reason<br />
You can decipher.</p>
<p>You can’t cipher<br />
Their explosion into non-water,<br />
Wings bursting, into this: the way<br />
The lone wind comes, rustles<br />
One blade of grass, begins<br />
To whisper, <em>I am here</em>.</p>

<p>Wouldn&#8217;t give you the name<br />
of every animal I&#8217;ve eaten<br />
even if I wanted to<br />
(unless you asked me nicely).</p>
<p>Unsurprising pig, fish<br />
bovine, fowl&#8211;consumed<br />
their bodies all<br />
with no remorse. But</p>
<p>if I told you I&#8217;d chewed up<br />
alligator, frog legs&#8211;slick<br />
unsympathetic beasts&#8211;<br />
would you flinch? Maybe<br />
but not because of love.</p>
<p>So if I tell you the names<br />
of the creatures I&#8217;ve swallowed<br />
that you could care for<br />
promise me you&#8217;ll cringe<br />
where I can see you.</p>
<p>Show me your face<br />
when I tell you how<br />
I&#8217;ve savored the taste<br />
of kangaroo and squirrel,</p>
<p>had seconds of raccoon<br />
and tender elk. Don&#8217;t look<br />
away when I tell you how<br />
I&#8217;ve devoured hare<br />
and youngling deer.</p>
<p>Watch me while I describe<br />
the way my teeth have torn<br />
the flesh from the bones<br />
of innocent things.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Doon scoops sugar over the pumpkin pulp<br />
pulled ridgy from the tinplate can</p>
<p>like the tunnel that runs under the river where he likes<br />
to shout his name. Arlo breaks an egg over that</p>
<p>and marvels at the cracked peel,<br />
its underside slippery like wet leaves.</p>
<p><em>Is this the chicken’s skin?</em> he asks.<br />
Earlier, when we woke before everyone else</p>
<p>he told me to be careful wiping his cheek with a cloth<br />
because there are bones inside him.</p>
<p>Every day freezing water that should be snow<br />
pools in the sinkholes on our street and carries the sky</p>
<p>upside down, a peculiar enantiodromia if you look<br />
for a while, which I do.</p>
<p>The earth is warming. In the playground where I hide<br />
in another book by the furtive Italian</p>
<p>I hear a woman say, <em>68 degrees in February</em><br />
<em> and liberals are going to complain about it</em>.</p>
<p>But earth-orbiting satellites can already see</p>
<p>the glacier’s cycle of retreat—<br />
Not six-thousand years from now</p>
<p>but now.</p>
<p>Arlo’s head is a new moon, a silk cocoon<br />
spun by the tireless caterpillar who twists her body</p>
<p>into thousands of figure eights for each strand.<br />
I can’t stop kissing it in the kitchen,</p>
<p>the last infant hair<br />
I’ll know. I hate to think not one strand of it</p>
<p>will be discovered in ocean residue<br />
or tree rings or sedimentary rocks. That this is all</p>
<p>we’ve got: afternoon with ten extra minutes<br />
of daylight; glass bowl of pulp and sugar. Four small hands</p>
<p>moving wildly over it</p>
<p>like a dial measuring the composition of air<br />
or birds scattering on the snow.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My grandmother lifts the corners<br />
of her mouth—a smile with no teeth;<br />
open palms coaxing me to her side.<br />
It’s hot, the thick air sticky on skin.</p>
<p>I stay at my mother’s side, fingers<br />
busy pleating the hem of her skirt<br />
where I can hide. There’s Uncle Kazuo<br />
and Dad. My brother isn’t poking</p>
<p>at my mosquito bites, but joining in<br />
with the many voices speaking<br />
in pidgin about “dem cars.”<br />
Then Mom’s hands rest on my shoulders,</p>
<p>pushing me away, telling me “be good.”<br />
Grandma leads me outside<br />
to where Chinese doves politely bow<br />
at our feet and a red cardinal</p>
<p>hops into a five-gallon glass jar, pecking<br />
up feed. I skirt the shade of the mango tree,<br />
tiptoeing past puddles of shattered fruit<br />
where the fruit flies hover low</p>
<p>close to the ground. I don’t like Hawai’i.<br />
Running to the driveway, I see<br />
our Chevrolet’s tires churns with dust.<br />
In the rear window, the three black heads</p>
<p>of my family disappear.<br />
My zori slippers slap against my heels,<br />
but no one looks back. Around me,<br />
the sun’s rays are the bars of a prison.</p>
<p>“Bumbye, they come home,” Grandma calls.<br />
“I give you mango, yes?” I don’t understand<br />
what she says about Uncle’s car ‘no go’,<br />
about a battery, or the two orange ovals</p>
<p>she cradles against her body. From her kitchen<br />
door, I watch as she peels the skin,<br />
slicing the fruit. All I know is that the juice<br />
stings the small cuts in my mouth.</p>

and the Bremer polka bops<br />
out the open window.</p>
<p>Tonight, Daddy’s frets slide<br />
to me across the shadows,<br />
and I clog in 9/8 time,<br />
hum from the dark side of the door.</p>

<p><em>This?</em> he says trying on a pose. The homeowner.<br />
Gentleman farmer. <em>How about this?</em></p>
<p>But he keeps looking at me. His petra<br />
eyes. <em>Mmm,</em> I say. And wait.</p>
<p>Beyond me his blue hills.<br />
<em>Is this the house the book paid for</em>?</p>
<p>I ask. He smiles. Runs a palm along his thigh.<br />
Solid. This wife, Elizabeth,</p>
<p>shadows, leans. Circles.<br />
The way he says her name.</p>
<p>A whisper. When will he know,<br />
and when will she?</p>
<p>His gaze fixed on the middle distance.<br />
He doesn’t belong here anymore.</p>
<p>She hovers, suspended just inside my sightline.<br />
Like me she is lean and dark and useful.</p>
<p>A scaffolding. He taps; he hums.<br />
I wait for him to settle in to himself. The stones</p>
<p>behind him restless, fitted together<br />
with a kind of insistence. She offers</p>
<p>coffee. She offers cigarettes. I ask<br />
about the book. How it was made. The flash</p>
<p>in his eyes. Mica glints in the stone. <em>The craftsmen<br />
</em><em>out here</em>, he says. <em>Bold. Marvelous</em>.</p>
<p>He asks about my hands. Scarred, calloused.<br />
Burned. <em>Art</em>, I laugh, <em>the price of art</em>.</p>
<p>He can’t tell me where his stories<br />
come from. They come.</p>
<p><em>There</em>, I say. <em>Hold</em>.<br />
He’s looked away.</p>
<p>Is she there, Elizabeth, over my shoulder?<br />
One plate. Two. The chosen tie,</p>
<p>mossgreen, askew. The buttons<br />
underneath. The squint. In the direction</p>
<p>of his cool sun. The one<br />
he’ll follow away from her.</p>

<p><em>The apple Eve were eating</em> &#8212; Charlie Poole</p>
<p>Charlie Poole, you picker with a busted hand,<br />
catching baseballs &amp; breakdowns.<br />
Slurring, on purpose, songs grown in mountain coves—<br />
distinct as certain species of salamanders—<br />
then carried, gap to gap, until<br />
they achieved the syncopated strangeness<br />
a child must feel, tending a loom in a towel mill,<br />
hearing the blue note held over Burley tobacco fields.<br />
You walk across the bottom land,<br />
drinking dipperfuls of liquor<br />
off dew-strewn corn, banjo tuning in and out of time.</p>
<p>I’d set a woman before you,<br />
one who walked the sharecroppers’ shacks<br />
outside Chatham, blood belying a brownness<br />
men would tell their wives about, such beauty<br />
making all men fools, and forgetful.<br />
She is the story no one tells or tells half true,<br />
the music that’s made for the playing,<br />
not to be found on a reel-to-reel tape.<br />
She preferred men to bending over tobacco rows—<br />
their long white feet, their desire to set before her<br />
a whole ham, a bolt of cherry-patterned cloth, a song<br />
(<em>I’d dive to the bottom and never come up</em>).</p>
<p>The rhythm method, prophylactics thick and medicinal,<br />
a falling down like a bucket of water to her knees,<br />
long horse tail of hair hanging over her shoulders—<br />
best not to ask how a woman survives hard times.<br />
But the children came along any way—<br />
a boy she put to walking the Bright Leaf,<br />
picking worms before he could see over the plants,<br />
coffee can of turpentine at his side.<br />
Daughters to raise other daughters<br />
and everything else a hustle for a peck of meal,<br />
a movie show, a bellyful of the moon’s gold coin.</p>
<p>She sat with the men who sat with the tobacco curing,<br />
smoke pouring out of the tops of buildings that looked old<br />
as soon as they were stacked, the embers tended<br />
by boys while a man played a fiddle or a guitar or a banjo<br />
in time to the swallows sweeping the tree line.<br />
A pallet has been made for her.<br />
She lies back on the cooling ground,<br />
seeing patterns in the stars studding the sky,<br />
a heavenly geometry she doesn’t have<br />
to learn to understand<br />
in her long-fingered hands.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before branch became birch, before sky<br />
became flight, before ground became</p>
<p>a verb, even before the sky raised its red<br />
lanterns, even while their bodies circled still</p>
<p>inside each pale-shelled egg, the birds<br />
were waiting for wings. They were always</p>
<p>the moral of the story. They knew what<br />
they knew about jealousy by the way each tree</p>
<p>watched their wings rustle like and unlike leaves.<br />
When the fair maiden brought her tears</p>
<p>to the hazel tree, they prepared. They sharpened<br />
their stomachs. They sang to their talons <em>blade, blade.</em></p>
<p>They sang to their beaks <em>pick, pick. </em>They sang on the girl’s<br />
shoulders, feathers folded. They were patient. When</p>
<p>the clock told its story of midnight, they sang <em>blade, pick<br />
blade, pick, </em>until the wicked were blind. Inside the birds’</p>
<p>throats, the sisters’ eyes watched those slippered feet,<br />
delicate as glass, fox-trot in tune with her sharpest songs.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I remember when we played wild rounds of Dutch Blitz<br />
till milking time. But now no one owns a cow,</p>
<p>the young rarely come, and when they do, they leave<br />
after lunch. This year we gather at a state park</p>
<p>in Indianapolis. Instead of dealing cards, cousins pass<br />
cell phones with photographs and talk about gall stones</p>
<p>and Uncle Ervie’s glass eye. Half asleep, I wander off<br />
toward the Nature Center that displays a mastodon tooth</p>
<p>and a gray bird with eyes ringed in red. The notecard<br />
says he’s a passenger pigeon. He traveled with others</p>
<p>in clouds so thick they’d darken the sky and make a ruckus<br />
loud as Niagara Falls. When their flocks were shot to pieces,</p>
<p>the scattered birds didn’t have a clue how to live alone.<br />
The last one, Martha, died in the Cincinnati Zoo. Maybe</p>
<p>I’ll see her at next year’s reunion.</p>
