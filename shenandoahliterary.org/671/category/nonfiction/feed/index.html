								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I am not perfectly certain what our forefathers understood by “the pursuit of happiness.” Of the friends whom I’ve asked for an opinion, the majority have taken that phrase to mean the pursuit of self-realization, or of a full humane life. Some darker-minded people, however, have translated “happiness” as a material well-being, or as the freedom to do as you damn please. I can’t adjudicate the matter, but even if the darker-minded people are right, we are entitled to ennoble the phrase and adapt it to the present purpose. I’m going to say a few things about the ways in which poetry might be seen as pursuing happiness. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">There are two main ways of understanding the word “poetry”. We may think of poetry as a self-shaping activity of the whole society, a collective activity by means of which a society creates a vision of itself, arranges its values, or adopts or adapts a culture. It is this sense of “poetry” which we have in Wallace Stevens’s poem, “Men Made Out of Words,” where he says</span></p>
<blockquote><p>The whole race is a poet that writes down<br />
The eccentric propositions of its fate.</p></blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But “poetry” may also mean what we more usually mean by it; it may mean verses written by poets, imaginative compositions which employ a condensed, rhythmic, resonant, and persuasive language. The second kind of poetry is not unconnected with the first; a poem written by a poet is a specific, expert, and tributary form of the general imagined activity. Nevertheless, I should like to begin by considering poetry in the second and restricted sense only, as referring to verse productions written by individuals whose pleasure it is to write them.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Back in the days of white saddle shoes and the gentleman’s grade of C, college undergraduates often found that they had an afternoon to kill. I can remember killing part of one afternoon, with a literary roommate, in composing what we called <i>A Complete List of Everything. </i>We thought of ourselves, I suppose, as continuators of<i> Dada</i>, and our list, as we set it down on the type-writer, amounted to an intentionally crazy and disrelated sequence of nouns. A section of our list might have read like this: Beauty, carburetor, sheepshank, pagoda, absence, chalk, vector, Amarillo, garters, dromedary, Tartarus, tupelo, omelet, caboose, ferrocyanide and so on. As you can imagine, we did not complete our list; we got tired of it. As in random compositions of all kinds – musical, pictorial, or verbal – it was possible to sustain interest for only so long, in the absence of deliberate human meaning. Nevertheless, there had been a genuine impulse underlying our afternoon’s diversion, and I think that it stemmed from a primitive desire that is radical to poetry – the desire to lay claim to as much of the world as possible through uttering the names of things. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This fundamental urge turns up in all reaches of literature, heavy or light. We have it, for example, in the eighteenth chapter of Hugh Lofting’s <i>Story of Doctor Doolittle</i>, a chapter in which all children take particular joy. As you will remember, Doctor Doolittle and his animal friends, on their way back from Africa, come by chance into possession of a pirate ship and find aboard her a little boy who has become separated from his red-haired, suff-taking uncle. The Doctor promises to find the little boy’s lost uncle, wherever he may be, and Jip the dog goes to the bow of the ship to see if he can smell any snuff on the North wind. Jip, it should be said, is a talking dog, and here is what he mutters to himself as he savors the air:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Tar; spanish onions; kerosene oil; wet raincoats; crushed laurel-leaves; rubber burning; lace-curtains being washed – no, my mistake, lace-curtains hanging out to dry; and foxes – hundreds of ‘em…</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">These are the easy smells, Jip says; the strong ones. When he closes his eyes and concentrates on the more delicate odors which the wind is bringing, he has this to report:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Brick, &#8211; old yellow bricks, crumbling with age in a garden-wall; the sweet breath of young cows standing in a mountain-stream; the lead roof of a dove-cote – or perhaps a granary – with the mid-day sun on it; black kid gloves lying in a bureau-drawer of walnut-wood; a dusty road with a horse&#8217;s drinking-trough beneath the sycamores; little mushrooms bursting through rotting leaves…</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A catalogue of that sort pleases us in a number of ways. In the first place, it stimulates that dim and nostalgic thing the olfactory memory, and provokes us to recall the ghosts of various stinks and fragrances. In the second place, such a catalogue makes us feel vicariously alert; we participate in the extraordinary responsiveness of Doctor Doolittle’s dog, and so feel the more alive to things. In the third place, we exult in Jip’s power of instant designation, his ability to pin things down with names as fast as they come. The effect of the passage, in short, is to let us share in an articulate relishing and mastery of phenomena in general.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This is what the cataloguing impulse almost always expresses – a longing to possess the whole world, and to praise it, or at least to feel it. We see this most plainly and perfectly in the Latin canticle <i>Benedicite,</i> <i>omnia opera domini.</i> The first verses of that familiar canticle are:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>O all ye Works of the Lord, bless ye the Lord:<br />
praise him, and magnify him for ever.<br />
O ye Angels of the Lord, bless ye the Lord:<br />
praise him, and magnify him for ever.<br />
O ye Heavens, bless ye the Lord:<br />
praise him, and magnify him for ever.<br />
O ye Waters that be above the firmament, bless<br />
ye the Lord: praise him, and magnify him for ever.</p></blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I needn’t go on to the close, because I am sure that you all know the logic of what follows. All the works of the Lord are called upon in turn – the sun, moon, and stars, the winds and several weathers of the sky, the creatures of earth and sea, and lastly mankind. There is nothing left out. The canticle may not speak of crushed laurel-leaves and sycamores, but it does say more comprehensively, “O all ye Green Things upon the Earth, bless ye the Lord”; it may not speak of foxes and of young cows in a mountain stream, but it does say “O all ye Beasts and Cattle, bless ye the Lord.” What we have in the <i>Benedicite</i> is an exhaustive poetic progress from heaven, down through the spheres of the old cosmology, to earth and man at the center of things – a progress during which the whole hierarchy of creatures cited in terms which, though general, do not seem abstract. It is a poem or song in which heaven and earth are surrounded and captured by words, and embraced by joyous feeling. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It is interesting to compare the strategy of the <i>Benedicite </i>to that of another and more personal poem of catalogue and praise, Gerard Manley Hopkins’s “curtal sonnet” “Pied Beauty”</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Glory be to God for dappled things –<br />
For skies of couple-colour as a brindled cow;<br />
For rose-moles all in stipple upon trout that swim;<br />
Fresh-firecoal chestnut-falls; finches wings;<br />
Landscape plotted and pieced – fold, fallow, and plough;<br />
And all trades, their gear and tackle and trim.<br />
All things counter, original, spare, strange;<br />
Whatever is fickle, freckled (who knows how?)<br />
With swift, slow; sweet, sour; adazzle, dim;<br />
He fathers-forth whose beauty is past change: Praise him.</p></blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As in the old canticle, God is praised first and last; but what lies between is very different. Hopkins does not give us an inventory of the creation; rather he sets out to celebrate one kind of beauty – pied beauty, the beauty of all things which are patchy, particolored, variegated. And in his tally of variegated things there is no hierarchy or other logic: his mind jumps, seemingly at random from the sky to trout to chestnuts to finches, and finally, by way of landscape, to the gear and tackle of the various trades. The poem <i>sets out</i>, then, to give scattered examples of a single class of things; and yet in its final effect this is a poem of universal praise. Why does it work out that way?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It works that way, for one thing, because of the randomness which I have just pointed out; when a catalogue has a random air, when it seems to have been assembled by chance, it implies a vast reservoir of other things which might just as well have been mentioned. In the second place, Hopkins’s poem may begin with dappled things, but when we come to “gear and tackle and trim,” the idea of variegation is far less clean, and seems to be yielding to that of <i>character</i>. When, in the next line, Hopkins thanks God for “All things counter, original, spare, strange,” we feel the poem opening out toward the celebration of the rich and quirky particularity of all things whatever. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The great tug-of-war in Hopkins’s poetry is between his joy in the intense selfhood and <i>whatness</i> of earthly things, and his feeling that all delights must be referred and sacrificed to God. For Whitman, with whom Hopkins felt an uncomfortable affinity, there was no such tension. It is true that Whitman said, “I hear and behold God in every object,” yet the locus of divinity in his poetry is not Heaven but in the mystic soul of the poet, which names all things, draws all things to unity in itself, and hallows all things without distinction. The divinely indiscriminate cataloguing consciousness of Whitman’s poems can consume phenomena in any order and with any emphasis; it acknowledges no protocol; it operates, as Richard Lewis has said, &#8220;in a world…devoid of rank or hierarchy.” In Section V of the “Song of Myself,” Whitman describes an experience of mystic illumination and then gives us these eight remarkable lines:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Swiftly arose and spread around me it be peace and knowledge<br />
that pass all the argument of the earth<br />
And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own,<br />
And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own,<br />
And that all of the men ever born are also my brothers,<br />
and the women my sisters and lovers,<br />
And that a kelson of the creation is love.<br />
And limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields,<br />
And brown ants in the little wells beneath them.<br />
And most scabs of the worm fence, heap’d stones,<br />
elder, mullein and pokeweed.</p></blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">That passage happens to proceed from God to man to nature, but there is nothing hierarchical in its spirit. Quite the contrary. This is the Whitman, “I do not call one greater and one smaller…The insignificant is as big to me as any.” He speaks in the same rapt voice of men and women and moss and pokeweed, and it is clear that he might have spoken to the same purpose of ducks or pebbles or angels. For Whitman, as for the Zen Buddhist, one thing is as good as another, a mouse is sufficient “to stagger sextillions of infidels,” and any part, however small, includes by synecdoche the wonder of the whole.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I could go on to speak of still more list-making poets. I could quote the Rilke of the <i>Duino Elegies</i>, who asks</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Are we perhaps here merely to say, House, Bridge,<br />
Fountain, Gate, Jug, Fruit-tree, Window,<br />
Or column, or Tower…</p></blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In our own immediate date there would be David Jones, Theodore Roethke, and Ruthven Todd in their later work; and indeed there have been poets in all lands and ages who have sought to resume the universe in ordered categories, or to suggest its totality by the causal piling-up of particulars. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But I’ve given enough examples already, and my aim here is not to make a catalogue of poetic catalogues, but to suggest by a few illustrations that the itch to call the roll of things is a major motive in the writing of poetry. Whether or not he composes actual catalogues like Whitman or Hopkins, every poet is driven by a compulsion to designate, and in respect of that drive the poet is not unlike people in general. We all want to be told, for no immediate practical reason, whether a certain column is Ionic or Corinthian, whether that cloud is stratus or cumulus, and what the Spanish word for “grocer” is. If we forget the name of a supporting actor in some film, or the roster of our Supreme Court bench, we are vexed and distracted until we remember, or look it up in some book of reference. If we travel to the tropics for the first time, and find ourselves surrounded not with oaks and maples but with a bristling wall of nameless flora, we hasten to arm ourselves with nature-books and regain our control over the landscape. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The poet is like that, only more so. He is born, it appears, with a stronger-than-usual need for verbal adequacy, and so he is always mustering and reviewing his vocabulary, and forearming excitement of a poet friend when he discovered in a mushroom guide the word <i>duff</i>, which signifies “decaying vegetable matter on the forest floor.” </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He was right to be excited, I think. <i>Duff</i> is a short, precise word which somehow sounds like what it means, and it is a word which poets must often have groped after in vain. My own recent discovery of that kind is the term for the depression in the centre of one’s upper lip. It had annoyed me, on and off, for many years that I had no word for something that was literally under my nose; then at long last I had the sense to inquire a Dentist. He told me that the word is <i>philtrum</i>, deriving from the Green word for “love-potion,” and implying, I should think, that the upper lip is an erogenous zone. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">That sort of word-hunting and word-cherishing may sound frivolous to some, and it must be admitted that the poet’s fascination with words can degenerate into fetishism and the pursuit of the exotic. More often, however, such researches are the necessary, playful groundwork for that serious business of naming which I have been discussing. Not all poets, especially in the present age, can articulate the universe with a <i>Benedicite</i>, or possess it by haphazard mysticism, but every poet is impelled to utter the whole of that world which is real to him, to respond to that world in some spirit, and to draw all its parts toward some coherence. The job is an endless one, because there are always aspects of life which we acknowledge to be real, but have not yet truly accepted. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For an obvious example, one has only to think of those machines which science has bestowed on us, and which Hart Crane said it was the great task of modern poetry to absorb. The iron horse has been with us for a century and a half, and the horseless carriage for eighty-odd years, but it is only in recent decades that <i>train</i> and <i>car </i>have consorted easily, in our verse with <i>hill</i> and <i>ship</i> and <i>hawk</i> and <i>wagon</i> and <i>flower. </i>And indeed there are still readers who think it unpoetic to bring up a pick-up truck into the landscape of a poem. The aeroplane has the aesthetic and moral advantage of resembling a bird and of seeming to aspire, but it took some hard writing in the thirties to install such words as <i>pylon </i>and <i>aerodrome</i> in the lexicon of modern verse. And for all our hard writing since, we have still not arrived at the point where, in Hart Crane’s words, machinery can form “as spontaneous a terminology of poetic reference as the bucolic world of pasture, plow, and barn.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The urge of poetry is not, of course, to whoop it up for the automobile, the plane, the computer, and the space-ship, but only to bring them and their like in to the felt world, where they may be variously taken, and to establish their names in the vocabulary of imagination. One perpetual task of the poet is to produce models of inclusive reaction and to let no word or thing be blackballed by sensibility. That is why I took large pleasure, some years ago, in bringing off a line which convincingly employed the words “reinforced concrete.” And that is why William Carlos Williams, with his insistence on noting and naming the bitterest details of the American urban scene, was such a hero of the modern spirit; he would not wear blinders in Rutherford and Patterson but instead wrote beautifully of peeling billboards, wind-blown paper bags, and broken bottles in the gravel, claiming for poetry a territory which is part of our reality, and needs to be seen and said. For poetry, there is no such thing as no-man’s-land. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The drive to get everything said is not merely a matter of acknowledging and absorbing the physical environment. The poet is also moved to designate human life in all its fullness, and it may be argued, for an extreme example, that the best part of Henry Miller arises from a pure poetic compulsion to refer to certain realities by their real names. Mr. Miller’s best is not very good, actually, and Aretino did it far better some centuries back; but there are passages in the Tropics which are clearly attempting, by means of an exuberant lyricism, to prove that the basic four-letter words are capable of augmenting our literary language without blowing it to pieces. I expressed this view not long ago, when testifying for Mr. Miller at an obscenity trial, and the judge replied only with a slow, sad shaking of the head. But I remain unshaken. I don’t think that Mr. Miller succeeds very often in his aim, partly because the words he champions are what the theater calls bad ensemble players. But as for his aim, I recognize it as genuine and would call it essentially poetic.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Thus far I have been speaking of poetry as an inventory of external reality; now let me speak of poetry as discovery and projection of the self. The notion that art is self-expression, the expression of one’s uniqueness, has provoked and excused a great deal of bad, solipsistic work in this century; nevertheless, the work of every good poet may be seen in one way or another as an exploration and declaration of the self.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In Emily Dickinson, for instance, we have a poet whose most electrifying work is the result of a keen and dogged self-scrutiny. Having spied for a long time on her own psyche, she can report that “Wonder is not precisely knowing,/ And not precisely knowing not.” Or she can produce a little poem like this, about how anguish engrosses the sense of time:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Pain has an element of blank;<br />
It cannot recollect<br />
When it began, or if there were<br />
A day when it was not.<br />
It has no future but itself,<br />
Its infinite realms contain<br />
Its past, enlightened to perceive<br />
New periods of pain.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Those lines are a pure trophy of introspection; they are not the re-phrasing of something known, but the articulation of one person’s intense inward observation. Yet because they are so articulate and so true, they light up both the poet’s psychology and everyone else’s.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Another version of self-discovery is implied in Edwin Muir’s statement that “the task of a poet is to make his imaginative world clear to himself.” What Muir meant was that every poet, owing to his character and early life, has a predisposition to project his sense of things by telling this or that story, by using this or that image or symbol. It may take a poet years to stumble on his destined story or symbol and set it forth, but for Muir they are always vaguely and archetypally there, at the back of the poet’s mind.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When we say of a poet that he has found his subject, or found his voice, we are likely to be thinking about poetry in Muir’s way, as a long struggle to objectify the soul. Marianne Moore sketching her first emblematic animal, Vachel Lindsay first attempting to catch the camp-meeting cadence, Frost first perceiving the symbolic possibilities of a stone wall — at such moments the poet is suddenly in possession of the formula of his feelings, the means of knowing himself and of making that self known. It was at such a moment that Rilke wrote in a letter, “I am a stamp which is about to make its impression.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As I have said, these moments of self-possession can be a long time in coming. Looking back at his early poems, and finding them cloudy and abortive, Yeats sadly wrote in his autobiography, “It is so many years before one can believe enough in what one feels even to know what the feeling is.” It was late in his life that a Scots poet whom I knew, while buckling his belt one morning, heard himself saying the Lord’s Prayer, and concluded that he must be a Christian after all. Or to speak of a deconversion, there were eight years of silence between the clangorous, prophetic early books of Robert Lowell and the publication of&nbsp;<i>Life Studies</i>, in which a flexible worldly voice suddenly speaks, with a whole personality behind it. What happened to Lowell was, in Yeats’s phrase, a “withering into the truth,” and some such process must occur, I think, in the life of every poet.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It is Yeats above all, in the present age, who has preached and embodied the notion that poetry is self-projection; that the poet creates his world “lock, stock, and barrel out of his bitter soul.” “Revelation is from the self,” he said; and though his way of putting it altered, he never ceased to think as he had done in 1893, when he wrote in his book&nbsp;<i>The Celtic Twilight</i>,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">What is literature but the expression of moods by the vehicle of symbol and incident? And are there not moods which need heaven, hell, purgatory and faeryland for their expression, no less than this dilapidated earth?</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">What’s fundamental in poetry, according to that definition, is moods — that is, the poet’s repertory of emotions, his spectrum of attitudes. All else is instrumental; personas, things, actions, and ideas are only means to externalizing the states of the poet’s heart. Before Yeats was through, he had as you know constructed a visionary system full of cycles and interpenetrating gyres which embraced all possible experience, all human types, all ages of man, all ages of history, this world and the next. It was a vision as inclusive as that of the <em>Benedicite,</em> but whereas the latter was for its poet an objective poem, Yeats’s vision is all a deliberate ramification of his subjective life. The phases of the moon, the gong-tormented sea, the peacock’s cry, hunchback and saint, Cuchulain — the ground of their reality is the various and conflicting spirit of the poet. When the young Yeats says</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Before us lies eternity; our souls<br />
Are love, and a continual farewell,</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">and when he later proclaims that “men dance on deathless feet,” he is not expounding the doctrine of reincarnation, but exploiting that idea as a means of expressing his own heart’s insatiable desire for life. The spirits who brought Yeats the substance of his system did not bring him an epitome of external truth; rather they said, “We have come to give you metaphors for poetry.” And when Yeats felt that certain of his expressive fictions were exhausted, he turned for a new start not to the world but to what he called, in a famous line, “the foul rag and bone shop of the heart.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I have said something now about two impulses of poetry — the impulse to name the world, and the impulse to clarify and embody the self. All poets are moved by both, but every poet inclines more to one than to the other, and a way of measuring any poet’s inclination is to search his lines for moments of descriptive power. Description is, of course, an elaborate and enchanted form of naming, and among the great describers of the modern period are Hopkins, or Williams, or Lawrence in his animal-poems, or Marianne Moore, who once described a butterfly as “bobbing away like wreckage on the sea.” And then there is that thunderstorm in a poem of Elizabeth Bishop’s, which moves away, as she tells it,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">in a series<br />
Of small, badly-lit battle scenes,<br />
Each in ‘Another part of the field.’</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Or there is the beautifully realized little sandpiper, in her latest book, who runs “in a state of controlled panic” along a beach which “hisses like fat.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Now, Yeats had his sea-birds too, and in his youthful novel&nbsp;<i>John Sherman</i>&nbsp;there were some puffins very accurately observed; but soon he became concerned, as he said, with “passions that had nothing to do with observation,” and the many birds of his subsequent work are a symbolic aviary of no descriptive interest. Yeats rarely gives us any pictorial pleasure, in birds or in anything else, being little concerned in his naming of things to possess them in their otherness and actuality. Nevertheless he, like all poets, is a namer; and Miss Bishop, for all her descriptive genius, is like all poets a scholar of the heart. It is a matter of proportion only, a matter of one’s imaginative balance.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And having said the word “balance,” I want to offer a last quotation from Yeats, which speaks directly to the question of art and happiness. In a letter to Dorothy Wellesley, written sometime in the ’30s, Yeats said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We are happy when for everything inside us there is a corresponding something outside us.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">That is an observation about life in general, but above all it applies to poetry. We are happy as poets, Yeats says, when our thoughts and feelings have originals or counterparts in the world around us — when there is a perfect conversancy or congruence between self and world. In Yeats’s poetry, the chief symbol for such happiness is the marriage-bed, and his artful lovers Solomon and Sheba, each striving to incarnate the other’s dream, represent the mutual attunement of imagination and reality. Keats’s lovers Madeline and Porphyro, in “The Eve of St. Agnes,” accomplish the same miracle and symbolize the same thing; each, without loss of reality, becomes the other’s vision, and the poem is one solution to Keats’s continuing enquiry into the right balance between vision and everyday experience. Elsewhere he employs or espouses other formulae, as in the poem “To Autumn,” where imagination does not transmute and salvage the world, but rather accepts it in all its transient richness, and celebrates it as it is.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">There is a similar quality of acceptance in Robert Frost’s poems about imaginative happiness, and I am going to read you one called “Hyla Brook.”</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">By June our brook’s run out of song and speed.<br />
Sought for much after that, it will be found<br />
Either to have gone groping underground<br />
(And taken with it all the Hyla Breed<br />
That shouted in the mist a month ago,<br />
Like ghost of sleigh-bells in a ghost of snow) —<br />
Or flourished and come up in jewelweed,<br />
Weak foliage that is blown upon and bent<br />
Even against the way its waters went.<br />
Its bed is left a faded paper sheet<br />
Of dead leaves stuck together by the heat —<br />
A brook to none but who remember long.<br />
This as it will be seen is other far<br />
Than with brooks taken otherwhere in song.<br />
We love the things we love for what they are.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It doesn’t trouble him, Frost says, that the brook on his farm runs dry by June, and becomes a gulley full of dead leaves and jewelweed; it may not be Arethusa or smooth-sliding Mincius; it may not, like Tennyson’s brook, go on forever; but it has real and memorable beauties that meet his desire. Loving it for what it is, the poet does not try to elevate his subject, or metamorphose it, or turn it into pure symbol; it is sufficient that his words be lovingly adequate to the plain truth. In another and comparable poem called “Mowing,” Frost builds towards a similar moral: “The fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows.” One doesn’t think of Wallace Stevens, who so stressed the transforming power of imagination, as having much in common with Frost, and yet Stevens would agree that the best and happiest dreams of the poet are those which involve no denial of the fact. In his poem “Crude Foyer,” Stevens acknowledges that poets are tempted to turn inward and conceive an interior paradise; but that is a false happiness; we can only, he says, be “content, /At last, there, when it turns out to be here.” We cannot be content, we cannot enjoy poetic happiness, until the inner paradise is brought to terms with the world before us, and our vision fuses with the view from the window.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Regardless, then, of subjective bias or of a reverence for fact, poets of all kinds agree that it is the pleasure of the healthy imagination to achieve what Stevens called “ecstatic identities with the weather.” When the sensibility is sufficient to the expression of the world, and when the world, in turn, is answerable to the poet’s mind and heart, then the poet is happy, and can make his reader so.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Now, if I were satisfied with my use of the word&nbsp;<i>world</i>, which I have been saying over and over in an almost liturgical fashion, I might feel that I had come near to the end of my argument. But&nbsp;<i>world</i>, in contemporary usage, is a particularly sneaky and ambiguous term. I see that I must try to use it more precisely, and that once I have done so there will be more to say. What might I mean by&nbsp;<i>world</i>? I might mean what Milton meant when he spoke of “this pendant world”; that is, I might mean the universe. Or I might mean the planet Earth; or I might mean the human societies of Earth, taken together. Or if I defined <i>world</i>&nbsp;by reference to the soul or self, I might mean what a German philosopher called the “Non-Ego,” or what Andrew Wyeth meant when he called one of his paintings “Christina’s World.” I am sure that you have all seen that touching painting of Wyeth’s: it shows us a crippled girl sitting in a field of long grass, and looking off toward a house and barn; her “world” consists of what she can see, and the desolate mood in which she sees it.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Literary critics, nowadays, make continual use of the word&nbsp;<i>world</i>&nbsp;in this last sense. They write of Dylan Thomas’s world of natural process, Conrad Aiken’s world of psychic flux, John Ransom’s gallant and ironic world of the South, or the boy-ish, amorous, and springtime world of e. e. cummings. Any of us could assign a “world,” in this sense, to any poet whose work we know; and in doing so, we would not necessarily be blaming him for any narrowness of scope. Robinson Jeffers on his mountaintop by the Pacific, writing forever of hawks and rocks and of the violent beauty of nature, was not prevented from speaking, through his own symbols and from his own vantage, of God and history and cities and the passions of men and women. Like any good poet of this American century, he found images and symbols which could manifest the moods of his heart, and elected a world of his own through which the greater world could someway be seen and accounted for.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And yet if one thinks back to the Italian fourteenth century, if one thinks of the world of Dante’s imagination, how peripheral and cranky Jeffers seems! Dante’s poetry is the work of one man, who even at this distance remains intensely individual in temper and in style; and yet the world of his great poem was, for his first readers, quite simply the world. This was possible because he was a poet of genius writing from the heart of a full and living culture. He lived and wrote, in Stevens’s phrase, “at the center of a diamond.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I bring up Dante not merely to belabor the present with him, but because there is something which needs to be explained. We are talking of poetry as a mode of pursuing happiness; we live in a century during which America has possessed many poets of great ability; nevertheless, it is no secret that the personal histories of our poets, particularly in the last thirty years, are full of alcoholism, aberration, emotional breakdowns, the drying-up of talent, and suicide. There is no need to learn this from gossip or biography; it is plainly enough set down in the poetry of our day. And it seems to me that the key to all this unhappiness may lie in the obligatory eccentricity, nowadays, of each poet’s world, in the fact that our society has no cultural heart from which to write.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Alberto Moravia, in a recent article on a great American writer and suicide, Ernest Hemingway, describes our country as “a minor, degraded and anti-humanistic culture,” and observes that our typical beginning novelist, lacking any faith in the resources of culture, “confines himself to recounting the story of his youth.” Having done so once successfully, the novelist proceeds for lack of any other subject to do it again and again, and, as Moravia puts it, “mirrors increasingly, in the mechanization of his own work, the mechanization of the society for which he is writing.” I am sorry to say that I cannot brush aside Signor Moravia’s general judgment upon us. I wish that I could.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">One can protest that not all of our novelists are the prisoners of their own early lives, and that most of our poets are cultured in the sense of being well schooled in the literary and artistic tradition. But one cannot deny that in the full sense of the word&nbsp;<i>culture</i>&nbsp;— the sense that has to do with the humane unity of a whole people — our nation is impoverished. We are not an articulate organism, and what most characterizes our life is a disjunction and incoherence aggravated by an intolerable rate of change. It is easy to prophesy against us. Our center of political power, Washington, is a literary and intellectual vacuum, or nearly so; the church, in our country, is broken into hundreds of sorry and provincial sects; colleges of Christian foundation hold classes as usual on Good Friday; our cities bristle like quartz clusters with faceless new buildings of aluminum and glass, bare of symbolic ornament because they have nothing to say; our painters and sculptors despair of achieving any human significance, and descend into the world of fashion to market their Coke-bottles and optical toys; in the name of the public interest, highways are rammed through old townships and wildlife sanctuaries; all other public expenditure is begrudged, while the bulk of the people withdraw from community into an affluent privacy.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I could go on with such sweeping assertions, and soon, no doubt, I would go too far, and would have to admit that anarchy is not confined to America, and that here or there we have the promise of cultural coherence. But I would reluct at making too much of the present boom in education, or the growth of regional theaters and symphony orchestras. Such things may be good in themselves, but they are not the kind of culture I am talking about. Houston has an admirable symphony orchestra, but the nexus of human relations in that city is the credit card, and where art does not arise from and nourish a vital sense of community, it is little more than an incitement to schizophrenia.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The main fact about the American artist, as a good poet said to me the other day, is his feeling of isolation. To Dante, at the other extreme, the world appeared as one vast society, or as a number of intelligibly related societies, actual and spiritual; his&nbsp;<i>Commedia</i>&nbsp;was the embodiment and criticism of a comprehensive notion of things that he shared with his age. Or think, if you will, of the sure sense of social relevance with which Milton embarked on the writing of an epic poem which was to be “exemplary to a nation.” Or think of that certainty of the moral consensus which lies behind the satires of Alexander Pope, and makes possible a wealth of assured nuance. How often, I wonder, has an American poet spoken so confidently from within the culture?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I began by distinguishing two ways of understanding the word&nbsp;<i>poetry</i>: first, as verse compositions written by individuals, and second, as that ensemble of articulate values by means of which a society shapes and affirms itself. It is the natural business of the first kind of poetry to contribute to the second, clarifying, enriching and refreshing it; and where the poet is unable to realize himself as the spokesman and loyal critic of an adequate culture, I think that his art and life are in some measure deprived of satisfaction and meaning.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To be sure, every poet is a citizen of the Republic of Letters, that imaginary society whose members come from every age and literature, and it is part of his happiness to converse, as it were, with the whole of tradition; but it is also his desire to put his gift at the service of the people of his own time and place. And that, as I have been saying, is a happiness not easily come by in contemporary America. It is possible, however isolated one may feel, to write out of one’s private experiences of nature or God or love; but one’s poetry will reflect, in one way or another, the frustration of one’s desire to participate in a corporate myth. In some of our poets, the atomism of American life has led to a poetry without people, or an art of nostalgia for childhood. Elsewhere, we find a confessional poetry in which the disorder and distress of the poet’s life mirrors that cultural disunity to which he, because of his calling, is peculiarly sensitive. When the poet addresses himself directly to our society, these days, it is commonly in a spirit of reproach or even secession, and seldom indeed in a spirit of celebration. I do not hold the poet responsible for that fact.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">At the close of one of his eloquent poems, Archibald MacLeish exhorts the modern poets to “Invent the age! Invent the metaphor!” But it is simply not the business of poets to invent ages, and to fashion cultures singled-handed. It may be that Yeats’s Ireland was in good part Yeats’s own invention, and he may have made some of it stick; but America is too huge a muddle to be arbitrarily envisioned. The two modern poets who tried to put a high-sounding interpretation on our country — Lindsay, whose Michigan Avenue was a street in Heaven, and Crane, whose Brooklyn Bridge leapt toward our spiritual destiny — ended by taking their own lives.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Now, all I wanted to say was that the poet hankers to write in and for a culture, countering its centrifugal development by continually fabricating a common and inclusive language in which all things are connected. But I got carried away by the present difficulty of attaining that happy utility.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Of course I have overstated the matter, and of course there are fortunate exceptions to be pointed out. Robert Frost was strongly aware of the danger that accelerating change might sweep our country bare of all custom and traditional continuity; some of his best poems, like “The Mountain,” are about that threat, and it is significant that he defined the poem as “a momentary stay against confusion.” Frost staved off confusion by taking his stand inside a New England rural culture which, during the height of his career, still possessed a certain vitality, and remains intelligible (if less vital) today. In general I should say that Frost assumed, rather than expounded, the governing ideas and ideals of that culture; but that, after all, is the way of poetry with ideas. It does not think them up; it does not argue them abstractly; what it does is to realize them within that model of felt experience which is a poem, and so reveal their emotional resonance and their capacity for convincing embodiments.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I was looking the other day at what is doubtless the best-loved American poem of this century, Robert Frost’s “Birches,” and it occurred to me that it might be both pertinent and a little unexpected if I finished by quoting it and saying one or two things about it.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When I see birches bend to left and right<br />
Across the lines of straighter darker trees,<br />
I like to think some boy’s been swinging them.<br />
But swinging doesn’t bend them down to stay.<br />
Ice-storms do that. Often you must have seen them<br />
Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning<br />
After a rain. They click upon themselves<br />
As the breeze rises, and turn many-colored<br />
As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.<br />
Soon the sun’s warmth makes them shed crystal shells<br />
Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust —<br />
Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away<br />
You’d think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.<br />
They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,<br />
And they seem not to break; though once they are bowed<br />
So low for long, they never right themselves:<br />
You may see their trunks arching in the woods<br />
Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground<br />
Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair<br />
Before them over their heads to dry in the sun.<br />
But I was going to say when Truth broke in<br />
With all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm<br />
I should prefer to have some boy bend them<br />
As he went out and in to fetch the cows —<br />
Some boy too far from town to learn baseball,<br />
Whose only play was what he found himself,<br />
Summer or winter, and could play alone.<br />
One by one he subdued his father’s trees<br />
By riding them down over and over again<br />
Until he took the stiffness out of them,<br />
And not one but hung limp, not one was left<br />
For him to conquer. He learned all there was<br />
To learn about not launching out too soon<br />
And so not carrying the tree away<br />
Clear to the ground. He always kept his poise<br />
To the top branches, climbing carefully<br />
With the same pains you use to fill a cup<br />
Up to the brim, and even above the brim.<br />
Then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish,<br />
Kicking his way down through the air to the ground.<br />
So was I once myself a swinger of birches.<br />
And so I dream of going back to be.<br />
It’s when I’m weary of considerations,<br />
And life is too much like a pathless wood<br />
Where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs<br />
Broken across it, and one eye is weeping<br />
From a twig’s having lashed across it open.<br />
I’d like to get away from earth awhile<br />
And then come back to it and begin over.<br />
May no fate willfully misunderstand me<br />
And half grant what I wish and snatch me away<br />
Not to return. Earth’s the right place for love:<br />
I don’t know where it’s likely to go better.<br />
I’d like to go by climbing a birch tree,<br />
And climb black branches up a snowwhite trunk<br />
Toward heaven, till the tree could bear no more,<br />
But dipped its top and set me down again.<br />
That would be good both going and coming back.<br />
One could do worse than be a swinger of birches.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To begin with, this poem comes out of the farm and woodland country of northern New England, and everything in it is named in the right language. Moreover, there are moments of brilliant physical realization, as when the breeze “cracks and crazes” the “enamel” of ice-laden birches, or the birch-swinging boy flings out and falls in a perfect kinetic line, “Kicking his way down through the air to the ground.” The poem presents a vivid regional milieu, and then subtly expands its range; naturally, and almost insensibly, the ground and sky of New England are magnified into Heaven and Earth.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Considered as self-projection, “Birches” is an example of how the pentameter can be so counter-pointed as to force the reader to hear a sectional and personal accent. Frost’s talking voice is in the poem, and so too is his manner: the drift of the argument is ostensibly casual or even whimsical, but behind the apparent rambling is a strict intelligence; the language lifts into rhetoric or a diffident lyricism, but promptly returns to the colloquial, sometimes by way of humor. The humor of Frost’s poem is part of its meaning, because humor arises from a sense of human limitations, and that is what Frost is talking about. His poem is a recommendation of limited aspiration, or high-minded earthliness, and the birch incarnates that idea perfectly, being a tree which lets you climb a while toward heaven but then “dips its top and sets you down again.” This is a case in which thought and thing, inside and outside, self and world, admirably correspond.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Because of his colloquialism and his rustic settings, Frost has often been thought of as a non-literary poet. That is a serious error. Frost was lovingly acquainted with poetic literature all the way back to Theocritus, and he was a conscious continuator and modifier of the tradition. Formally, he adapted the traditional meters and conventions to the natural cadence and tenor of New England speech. Then as for content, while he did not echo the poetry of the past so promiscuously as T.S. Eliot, he was always aware of what else had been written on any subject, and often implied as much. In “Hyla Brook,” which I read to you a few minutes ago, Frost makes a parenthetical acknowledgement that other poets — Tennyson, Milton, Theocritus perhaps — have dealt more flatteringly with brooks or streams than he feels the need to do.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In “Birches,” Frost’s reference is more specific, and I am going to re-read a few lines now, in which I ask you to listen for the voice of Shelley:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Often you must have seen them<br />
Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning<br />
After a rain. They click upon themselves<br />
As the breeze rises, and turn many-colored<br />
As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.<br />
Soon the sun’s warmth makes them shed crystal shells<br />
Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust —<br />
Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away<br />
You’d think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Many-colored. Glass. The inner dome of heaven. It would not have been possible for Frost to pack so many echoes of Shelley into six lines and not be aware of it. He is slyly recalling the two most celebrated lines of Shelley’s Adonais:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Life, like a dome of many-colored glass,<br />
Stains the white radiance of eternity.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Such a reminiscence is at the very least a courtesy, a tribute to the beauty of Shelley’s lines. But there is more to it than that. Anyone who lets himself be guided by Frost’s reference, and reads over the latter stanzas of Shelley’s lament for Keats, will find that “Birches,” taken as a whole, is in fact an answer to Shelley’s kind of boundless neo-Platonic aspiration. It would be laborious, here and now, to point out all the pertinent lines in Adonais; suffice it to say that by the close of the poem Keats’s soul has been translated to Eternity, to the eternal fountain of beauty, light and love, and that Shelley, spurning the Earth, is embarking on a one-way upward voyage to the Absolute. The closing stanza goes like this:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The breath whose might I have invoked in song<br />
Descends on me; my spirit’s bark is driven<br />
Far from the shore, far from the trembling throng<br />
Whose sails were never to the tempest given;<br />
The massy earth and spheréd skies are riven!<br />
I am borne darkly, fearfully, afar;<br />
Whilst, burning through the inmost veil of Heaven,<br />
The soul of Adonais, like a star,<br />
Beacons from the abode where the Eternal are.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Frost’s answer to that is, “Earth’s the right place for love.” In his dealings with Shelley’s poem, Frost is doing a number of things. He is for one thing conversing timelessly with a great poem out of the English tradition; he is, for another thing, contending with that poem in favor of another version of spirituality. And in his quarrel with Shelley, Frost is speaking not only for his own temper but for the practical idealism of the New England spirit. Frost’s poem does justice to world, to self, to literary tradition, and to a culture; it is happy in all the ways in which a poem can be happy; and I leave it with you as the best possible kind of answer to the question I have been addressing.&lt;/pre&gt;</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>Page by page <i>Egg Island Almanac</i>, the Crab Orchard Series in Poetry’s Open Competition winner for 2017, brings to mind a statement by Wendell Berry in <i>Standing by Words</i>, a perspective combining ethics and poetics: “We are speaking where we stand, and we shall stand afterwards in the presence of what we have said.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Cape Cod with its landscape and seascape, its flora and fauna, has been a prime focus of Brendan Galvin’s for decades, and this new volume contributes substantively to the whole—an accretion of wisdom grounded in the provenance of personal and local history. Our attention is freshened and fledged by the prevalence of birds, familiars and rarities, each encounter bearing its special signature. In this collection, Galvin’s eighteenth, marked by an intimacy of perception that never self-inflates or parades, nature shows us our standing among her truths, vistas through language into wonder and mystery. The eventfulness of small—though resonantly large—moments put into words predominates here, the poet’s sensibility taking in data till the inherent pattern and the finished text gain imaginative standing.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One of the largest lessons Galvin has learned across his prolific career is that nature is available to be witnessed in its individuality when perceived with rigor and honesty of language. He knows that revelations lie in getting place and its inherent events down in a manner that brings out the grace and light within phenomena, and, on balance, also the darkness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Man’s problematic relationship to his ecosystems has always been a concern of Galvin’s, arousing wonderment at natural processes as well as satire toward despoilment. That latter focus activates several poems in the book. For instance, what to make of a peacock strutting among the Cape’s wild turkeys in “Out of the Ordinary”?<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Galvin as long-time watcher lays his bet on “some fop’s summer garden, / McMansion and bird abandoned / for Greenwich or Darien.” And in “Labor Day” the permanent residents “are getting their town / and native language back.” The summer people load up and leave—one-percenter Joads—and now sofas are no longer “ambience furnishings.” Through the seasons that structure <i>Egg Island Almanac</i>, poem after poem stands in the presence of what Galvin has said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These poems have come about through habitual alertness to opportunities of time and place and through language tempered and shaped for each engagement with the world as it is. Seamus Heaney in <i>The Redress of Poetry</i> emphasizes poetry’s ability “to place a counter-reality in the scales—a reality which may be only imagined but which nevertheless has weight because it is imagined within the gravitational pull of the actual.” Poetry fulfills its counterweighting duty “as long as the coordinates of the imagined thing correspond to those of the world we live in and endure.” No escape from reality, but the creation of a truth “before which we can know ourselves in a more fully empowered way.” We become citizens of more than one domain.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Galvin draws the reader “within the gravitational pull of the actual” on his home grounds in order to bring resources of imagery, figurative language, tone, sonics, and syntax to bear in a wholistic act of creation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The number of avian species in <i>Egg Island Almanac</i> totals some three dozen. The birds range&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">in size from great blue herons to chickadees. Some are year-round residents at the Cape; others&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">find it a stop on the Atlantic Flyway; yet others get blown in from who knows where—“a godsend from the marvelous” in “Astonishment.” These creatures prompt a diversity of musings within the frame of actuality and imagination. A blizzard in “Limbo” provides the context for a meditation that illustrates how dimensionally one can live by giving reality—predator and prey&#8211;its due through a special kind of attention. Even with their ability to hide, what chance do chickadees and quail stand against red-tailed hawks and coyotes? The poem concludes with a leap of stunning rightness as different worlds come into the same field:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Given what comes from the air<br />
without warning, and out of the marshes,<br />
I know that longevity means nothing<br />
for them, but where are they? All day the souls<br />
of children in Limbo have troubled me,</p>
<p>that savage human neverland<br />
that’s too much theology for a handful<br />
of feathers defending a heartbeat<br />
while this white absence rumbles through.</p></blockquote>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Again and again, to extend curiosity and imaginative empathy to creatures is to have them enter us, the circle closing.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Another aspect of place for deep watchers is local folklore. “Revenant” begins, as do many of Galvin’s most successful meditations, in a seemingly off-hand manner: The speaker was thinking about a chore, weed-whacking, when something dropped onto the top of a dead tree. A fish hawk, prey in its claws. Virtually an apparition now, but before the wholesale use of DDT</span></p>
<blockquote><p>They say a poultryman<br />
might mount a wagon wheel on a pole back then&lt;</p>
<p>so the fish hawk could construct its elaborate nest<br />
up there and drive off any chicken hawks,<br />
saving its young and the farmer’s<br />
which it had no taste for.</p></blockquote>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Indeed, the importance of that last line, its sly wisdom—this is no Disney world.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Galvin’s affinity for gardening has shown itself in numerous poems over the years, and in a 2008 interview for <i>Shenandoah</i> he playfully links it to composition: </span></p>
<blockquote><p>Making a poem can be compared with making compost, it seems to me. In a notebook or<br />
on the pile you take a shred of this, dump a bunch of that, stir it up, come back in a week<br />
and add something else. They both grow by accretion, at least in the poem’s<br />
brainstorming phase when I’m trying to get everything I can possible use down on the<br />
page. Tendrils begin appearing here and there. Volunteers.</p></blockquote>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And so we move to “Volunteers,” from the new collection. Pattypan squashes’ vines</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; have crawled from<br />
the business of forty-eight years’<br />
compost. Survivors of scoop, dump,<br />
toss and drop, they’re escaping<br />
themselves by passing themselves on,<br />
free-range theologians with their<br />
faith in the risen dust.</p></blockquote>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">An observation weighted with worlds in the saying of it. And typical of this poet’s closures, understated and thereby ongoing with suggestions of immensities.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The ability to fashion metaphors that illuminate and not merely shine appears everywhere in Galvin. Witness the thistles of the field and how they activate the poet’s wit in “Sentry.” This botanical commonplace looks like “another / of evolution’s jokes” the poem begins. Then, putting the pedal to the metal, “Still, mixed metaphor,” it looks like someone heavy-handedly freighted it with shaving brushes</span></p>
<blockquote><p>then loaded one of those<br />
salad shooters they<br />
used to hawk on TV<br />
and fired green sickles<br />
and scimitars at you.</p></blockquote>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But what does the poet know from experience in the weight-counterweight relationship Heaney refers to?</span></p>
<blockquote><p>The thistle is a teacher<br />
white and silken, proof<br />
that the pilgrim in us all<br />
must cede his spines<br />
and hackers to endure.</p></blockquote>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Adaptation. A principle to stand by, and given here in plain speech compressed for the poem’s dynamic, a hallmark of Galvin’s poetics.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There is a great deal to admire in <i>Egg Island Almanac.</i> Altogether this is a moving account of&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">venturings and illuminations. Through the interplay of human universals and natural particulars&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">these poems press their claims for attention. Praise to Brendan Galvin for placing his home&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">grounds in such patient, exacting, intuitive regard.</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">&lt;/pre&gt;</span></span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Lord, bless John Ames Boughton,<br />
</em><em>this beloved son and brother and husband and father</em>.<br />
—Ames blessing Jack, Marilynne Robinson’s <em>Gilead</em></p>
<p>I met Marilynne Robinson twelve days after Donald Trump’s election, seventy-five weeks after coming out to a pair of flummoxed parents, and over three years after a spinal cord injury left me temporarily paralyzed below the waist. Three devastating moments, and had it not been for one of America’s greatest novelists, I wouldn’t have made it through any of them. At times when I was stripped of the support systems upon which I depended—when my identity and the very sanctity of my soul were called into question like the flimsy story of a suspect interrogated by police—it was Robinson who galvanized me not simply to accept my “prodigality” but to glean all the wisdom I could from bearing the burden of this wondrous label.</p>
<p>First things first: what do I mean when I use the word “prodigal?” Not necessarily one who is financially irresponsible, as the Latin adjective <em>prodigus </em>(wasteful, lavish) suggests. No, in this case, the cognate verb proves more helpful: <em>prodigo</em>, a compound of the prefix <em>pro </em>(forward) and <em>ago</em> (to drive or do), which literally indicates that one who’s prodigal resorts to errancy—conveniently, as will become clear—in a forward or <em>progressive</em> direction. To put it more figuratively, then, a <em>prodigal</em> individual often parts ways with the hegemonic <em>status quo</em>, and perhaps even traditional Christian decency.</p>
<p>Repudiating one’s father figure likewise falls into this category, as Robinson reminds us in her 2004 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel <em>Gilead</em>, a reworked iteration of the biblical Prodigal Son parable. Here, she turns to the epistolary form to spin out a story of the aging reverend John Ames who, after suffering through the loss of a wife (and daughter) in childbirth, consigned himself to perpetual bachelorhood. That is, until the transient Lila comes along one Sunday, seeking refuge from the rain in Ames’ Congregational church. Their courtship proves brief and unconventional; they marry one another, and before long, Lila gives birth to a son. He’s only eight when Ames is diagnosed with a terminal heart condition and begins penning a letter to Robby so that he’ll have something to remember the reverend by. What begins as a reflection on their family history, however, soon metamorphoses into an account of Ames’ tumultuous relationship with his recently-returned prodigal godson—and namesake—Jack, the forty-something child of his lifelong compatriot and fellow minister Robert Boughton.</p>
<p>Previously known for his vicious childhood pranks, Jack fled town after impregnating a young girl years before. Now he’s back, and Ames is soon the only one who knows why. Their talks, first awkward, then strained, then cordial, and finally intimate, if never completely unfettered, at last impel the minister to admit to Robby, “You might wonder about my pastoral discretion, writing this all out,” but “he is a man about whom you may never hear one good word, and I just don’t know another way to let you see the beauty there is in him” (232).</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>Having read <em>Gilead</em> as a newly-minted first year—when bouts of homesickness and estrangement were daily demons—I turned to <em>Home </em>less than a year later. This second novel of Robinson’s <em>Iowa Cycle</em>, which focuses on the same two families in the same small town of Gilead, Iowa, became my primary fountainhead of solace after an accident that transformed life as I knew it on the fifth of July, 2013. My father and I left our one-story ranch for a bicycle ride after breakfast. As we traversed Bigger Road not two minutes away, my ears vaguely registered a horn, stentorian and strident on a morning still suffused with patriotism. Then pain. Nothing but shattering anguish from the shrapnel of a lumbar vertebra that rendered me near-feral, howling primordial groans which seemed incapable of claiming as their source a human of the twenty-first century. Numbness, at that same moment, overtook my latter half with the surprising speed of power going out in one’s home during stormy weather. One moment an opposing wall’s in view; the next minute it’s not. Unable to recoil from cars whipping by, powerless to crawl from the middle of the street, impotent to move my legs, knees, ankle, feet, toes, I was paralyzed.</p>
<p>It took six months to relearn the art of walking.</p>
<p>A crowd gathered round; two nurses, passersby, emerged from the fray to assist; an ambulance soon arrived and delivered me to Kettering Hospital after fifteen minutes of enduring a broken back bound to the rigid board of a gurney. Mine was a short stay—less than twenty-four hours in the ICU—because a team of doctors ruled out surgery due to osteopenia (a precursor to the osteoporosis with which I now grapple, having unwittingly turned my proverbial old phone in for the upgrade) that’s resulted in dangerously impoverished bone density since childhood. So the following day a longer ambulance ride was in store, this time to the University of Cincinnati Hospital for a spinal-fusion surgery of my L1 vertebra with two vertebrae above and two below. After five hours, a ten-plus-inch incision, more than thirty staples (that eventually had to be extricated from the flesh of my scarred back with something eerily akin to an everyday office staple-remover), eight titanium screws and two rods, I found myself the possessor of what some have since coined a bionic back. Still, I didn’t then—nor do I now—feel like Wolverine with his adamantium. One week later, the last (and lengthiest) of my paramedic escorts left me for the long haul of rehabilitation at Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton—just twenty minutes away from my hometown of Kettering, Ohio—where they were wont, at the Godforsaken time of 7:00 am, to serve me greasy ham omelets for breakfast with barely-melted slabs of Kraft singles wedged into the fold. The worst part was that I don’t even like eggs, let alone ones that, had the cafeteria staff burned them any further, would have been delivered to me the tawny color of colonial parchment, always with pink chunks of a meat whose gritty texture I strove to ignore.</p>
<p>This stage nevertheless proved the easiest segment of a recovery experience that continued long after a month of inpatient therapy and my eventual discharge. Only then did I move back into the childhood home away from which I had just begun to appreciate my existence. Indeed, I had been counting on going away again—and the summer lasting only temporarily—once having assumed that life would march beyond the shelves of <em>Hardy Boys </em>books accumulating dust in my Wedgewood-walled bedroom, the long-untuned strings of the piano that at one point had claimed thirty minutes of daily practice-time, the marching band memorabilia and varsity-tennis trophy for sportsmanship still displayed on our living-room mantle. Now I was returning—possibly to stay, because it was clear that I’d need to take the first semester of my sophomore year off. After that it was anyone’s guess. I was still using a wheelchair. And a walker, much less the cane I rely upon now, seemed like a very distant goal.</p>
<p>So too, the heroine of <em>Home</em>, Boughton’s daughter Glory, returns to Gilead. For years she’s assured her father, and the rest of the family, that she’s “[s]till teaching, still engaged to be married, yes,” and “twice the fiancé had actually come home with her, had shaken hands all around and smiled under their tactful scrutiny,” but now everything’s changed (7). She quit her teaching job in preparation for a wedding, which never materialized, Glory&#8217;s hope snuffed out like candles on a birthday cake. Lacking funds and a fiancé, then she’s presently “alone with poor old Papa, sad old Papa, upon whose shoulder much of Presbyterian Gilead above the age of twenty had at some time wept. No need to say anything, and no hope of concealing anything either.” To Glory, her hometown “seemed different,” “now that she had returned there to live,” Robinson explains, though of course “the old place and the old stories were” dear. Still, “the past was a very fine thing, in its place,” and “her returning now, to stay, as her father said, had turned memory portentous” (8). For Glory, “[t]o have it overrun its bounds this way and become present and possibly future, too” was, “they all knew,” “a thing to be regretted.” I, too, had plenty to regret—and ostensibly little to be thankful for, despite that I was in my own room again. Well, not exactly, because we had to jettison the old bunk-beds for accessibility reasons: the bottom tier was too low, and the top one made its counterpart too difficult to access anyway.</p>
<p>The thing you don’t realize at the time is that in the hospital, nurses, therapists, visitors, care packages, candies, cards keep you perpetually busy. You’re occupied in this sterile environment which somehow transforms into a kind of home—my father going so far as to request a mini-fridge by the conclusion of our stay (<em>our</em>, because my parents slept over every night)—and that’s the most effective medicine when contemplation shepherds you only towards reflecting upon how you’ve become crippled—the word my grandmother used one afternoon on a phone-call with her best friend. Not that she meant anything by this, fear flickering across a weather-beaten face when she realized what descriptor had evaded her failing mental censors. It’s what I was becoming, after all, with no one to tell me otherwise.</p>
<p>No one except for Glory. We spent quite a bit of time with one another, this ever-tearful, thirty-eight-year-old protagonist of <em>Home</em> and I, as we navigated our forced homecomings together—she to her father Boughton, yours truly to his ruddy-bricked house in the quintessential suburbia of southwest Ohio. Without the presence of a sibling like Jack.</p>
<p>“Why do you keep saying that you wish you could go back to school?” my mother demands to know one morning during <em>Meet the Press</em>—a new family ritual following church while we enjoy homemade eggs with globular bits of salsa, broccoli from microwavable packages, and cheddar cheese. The first time Mom serves one of these frittatas after the hospital, I groan inwardly—inwardly, because this is the person who’s done everything for me, from advocating on my behalf to embracing her son on mornings when unyielding tears cascaded down the contours of his face—take one bite, struggle to roll myself away from the table, and vomit in the hall bathroom with a newly-installed sliding door which replaced the old one we’d open in the normal fashion. This spontaneous compulsion to throw up jarred me, because I’d eaten omelets of far poorer quality in the hospital, but I suppose you expect to be at their mercy there. You know you’re not free. Still you hope—even dream, and I don’t use the word melodramatically—that once you get out everything will change. When you finally realize your wishes amount to nothing more than a fanciful ignorance of what the word <em>rehabilitation </em>truly means, symptoms such as nausea may ensue. By the time we get into it while listening to Chuck Todd’s roundtable moderation, however, I’ve overcome this aversion to my mother’s breakfasts, about three or four weeks following my return from Miami Valley and midway through August. Now, it’s the prospect of a semester starting without me at Washington and Lee University, where I’ve already completed one year with friends and mentors who seem to have known me far longer, that looms large in my mind. “Can you not find joy in spending time with us?” she interrogates, “or your grandfather,” who’s ensnared within the final stages of a progressive neurological disease.</p>
<p>Not unlike Glory’s aging, increasingly-ill father Boughton. I thus find refuge, and absolution from festering guilt, in those opening lines of Robinson’s second Gilead novel: “‘Home to stay, Glory! Yes!’ her father said, and her heart sank. He attempted a twinkle of joy at this thought,” though the Presbyterian minister manages to correct himself to add, “for a while this time!” (3). He takes her bag, “first shifting his cane to his weaker hand,” and all she can manage to think is “dear God in heaven,” “[h]ow could her father be so frail.”</p>
<p>I’m reading <em>Home</em>, in fact, when Mom trudges over to perch on the arm of a couch that’s only two feet away from the recliner, once Dad’s, which I’ve now commandeered as my own. Angled across from a fifty-inch television in our bonus room, she asks if I could perhaps put my book down for a moment. Black hair pulled back with a clip, sweatshirt askew from doing the dishes, crevices under two eyes slumping towards her mouth from exhaustion and anxiety and age. She shouldn’t be doing all of this. Hell, at sixty, she’s a senior citizen. But so am I—ever since my physical therapist had the nerve to congratulate me on a much-improved gait during our last session. Sweaty, miserable, fatigued, I was ready to celebrate, until she told me that I’d achieved the ambulatory rate for an average ninety-year-old male.</p>
<p>“I know you don’t want to talk about this,” Mom murmurs now, “but we have to: I managed to get us into the outpatient physical therapy clinic three times this week—Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and—just brace yourself here—it’s going to have to be at 9:00 in the morning.” I could do the math: it took over an hour-and-a-half just to get ready—and that’s if I didn’t shower—between the bowel program I was still administering to myself, and the compression stockings I daily hiked up to my thighs to prevent a blood clot, and the series of transfers that were required of me just to get from point A to point B, so take that and add it to another thirty minutes to get to the hospital—plus another half-an-hour to eat the breakfast my parents would force me to consume (yes, I know, it’s the best meal of the day)—and we’re looking at a 6:30 wake-up call. I can’t even remember the last time I woke up at six-thirty.</p>
<p>One consoling fact sustains me in the face of this news: at least I’d get to rest for the remainder of the day.</p>
<p>But that’s not quite right either. “On Monday afternoon, you have to get your blood drawn, on Tuesday, you have a check-up appointment with your physiatrist, and then after that we have to drive back over to Dr. Teater,” our family physician. Probably because they’re afraid a pesky UTI—non-medical speak: a urinary-tract infection—might be lingering after I catheterized myself six times a day in the hospital. “Wednesday, the home-health nurse comes.”</p>
<p>“Can I at least nap after physical therapy Friday?”</p>
<p>“Honey, uh, don’t you remember that you have your occupational therapy appointment once a week, after PT?” I obviously hadn’t, so she takes me in her arms and kisses my forehead, and leaves me to ponder this novel identity. I’m a patient, which means my time is no longer my own. (Make no mistake about it: <em>patient</em> and <em>passive</em> both derive from the Latin <em>patior</em>, to suffer.)</p>
<p>Glory, for her part, experiences a similar forfeiture of individual autonomy when, for instance, Boughton offers her their family abode towards the close of <em>Home</em>, as it becomes increasingly clear that he won’t be an occupant much longer. This is not the life she wanted for herself. This is not the life she planned. And even before Boughton broaches the subject of bequeathing her the house, she doesn’t particularly relish going “off to help her father put his socks on and shave and get his shirt buttoned,” not because she doesn’t love him but because it contrasts so starkly with her expectations for what life was supposed to amount to (33). “At least I know what is required of me now and that is something to be grateful for,” she thinks while assisting the aging Presbyterian minister “with his tie and his jacket.” Glory’s even patient when her father insists that she “won’t mind waiting on” him and Jack “this one time,” after the prodigal son first arrives home, to which she responds, “This one time, now” (35). Jack’s needs likewise prove a source of constant anxiety: “Why hadn’t she bought clothes for him weeks ago?” Glory wonders while watching him work outside (194). “Because he was a stranger and she was afraid of offending him with so personal an attention. Because her buying clothes for him would allude to his poverty and offend him. Because it might seem like a subject of conversation for people who saw her buying them and this would embarrass and offend him.”</p>
<p>All this to say, she’s no longer a teacher. She’s no longer a lover. She’ll never be a mother, and she’ll never enjoy a life beyond Gilead. Glory relinquishes her dreams “of a real home for herself and the babies, and the fiancé, a home very different from this good and blessed and fustian and oppressive tabernacle of Boughton probity and kind intent” (102). I’ve meanwhile become wheelchair-bound—as people so often say—a spinal-cord patient, and a college drop-out, unsure which of these will define me for the remainder of my life. In other words: just as <em>Home</em>’s protagonist must salvage her life in the wake of personal loss, so too am I challenged to envision a repurposed future for myself. It becomes my task, like Glory’s, to forge new joy from very changed circumstances. Together, we learn to love our prodigal selves.</p>
<p>For Glory, this involves learning to love her prodigal brother too, which proves no mean feat. Even old Boughton fears his “children might not be getting along” (72). After living together for several weeks, however, their trust begins to fortify, ever so slightly at first, over a relatively insignificant question: when to return a library book, Friedrich Engels’ <em>The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844</em>. It hasn’t been checked out for twenty-five years, so Jack slips it into a grocery sack to “tantalize [his] sister’s budding interest in Marxism” (140-141). At first she’s of firm mind to “take the book back tomorrow,” to just “slip it onto a shelf,” but when Jack asks her to wait so that he might be able to read it, she concedes, “I’ll take it back day after tomorrow. Next week. It won’t make any difference. I might read it” (142). Then, finally, Jack laughs. He’s stolen a book—and what a prodigal book it must have been during the Cold War—but Glory agrees to keep his secret, and even to revel in his lawlessness.</p>
<p>The siblings’ situation progresses from there: one evening, Jack admits that “the fellow who did not marry [Glory] was a very foolish man” (149). But she counters that he was “[n]ot altogether. He was a married man” (149). We realize then that Glory committed adultery. <em>The seemingly upstanding school teacher-turned-caretaker, warden of the family home, committed adultery</em>. “Oh,” Jack replies. “So he said,” she continues. She “didn’t know it at the time,” but Glory qualifies her defense with a suspect “particularly,” to which Jack laughs. “You know what I mean,” she says, explaining that she “could have figured it out if [she]’d wanted to.” Then he comforts her: “Ah, that’s hard. I’m sorry.” By now, we realize the difference between propriety and prodigality hasn’t just been blurred but rubbed out completely. Later, Jack even begins a conversation with the address, from “[o]ne sinner to another” (137). Mutual waywardness bonds them one to the other, so much so that when her brother finally bemoans that he was unable to attend their mother’s funeral because he was incarcerated, Glory rebuts, “You don’t have to tell me anything you don’t want to. Not that it matters. I don’t care if you’ve been in jail” (289). And when, just a few short days before he leaves, Jack admits that Ames told him he is “a good man,” Glory insists, “Well, I could have told you you are a good man. I’ve said it in so many words, surely” (308). Prodigality kindles an intimacy that’s never quite burned before.</p>
<p>So too, the fire’s aflame in Kettering, but threatening to incinerate us all. That my mother has gone to such lengths to arrange appointments, finagle extra physical therapy sessions, chauffeur me to whatever doctor has staked a claim to my case this week, suggests there’s something to fix, to rehabilitate, to cure. This conclusion indeed seems obvious: I can’t functionally walk. So on the one hand, I remain to this day thankful for her indefatigable efforts. On the other hand, though, I can’t help but wonder why it’s so essential to walk in the first place. Admittedly, there are medical reasons to do so: immobility increases the risk of blood clots, decreases your muscle mass, and often leads to obesity. Yet is there something more? Perhaps—just perhaps there <em>is</em> in this country of rugged individualism, football, the great frontier, a nearly-religious fidelity to independence, and an Internet meme that features Clint Eastwood scowling with the caption, “No one owes you a damn thing; get off your ass and earn it.” We eschew dependence, we fear vulnerability, we despise weakness with a pathological vehemence, despite that the meek supposedly inherit the earth. Even so, very few impaired characters are played by disabled actors on TV and in the movies, which is to say that even when we’re watching something about impairment we crave the reassurance that in <em>real life</em>, at least, the performer isn’t actually disabled. Somehow this helps us enjoy the experience more. The Super Bowl’s tonight, as I write this, and my parents ask over the phone whether I’m planning to watch it. But what reason do I have watch something that enforces the cardinal virtues of fitness, strength, and physicality? What does this tell us about the human condition, I ponder, besides that my “manliness” will indeed be held up to the ideal, the paradigm, of Tom Brady. To hell with him. I’ve wandered from this norm, now in my lameness, and that makes me prodigal.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, lameness doesn’t seem so lame because of Marilynne Robinson.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>The third of Robinson’s <em>Iowa Cycle </em>novels centers on Ames’ wife Lila: she’s rescued from an abusive household by a woman named Doll, the two of them fall in with a group of itinerant workers supervised by the patriarch Doane, Lila eventually leaves the group, only to become a prostitute and then a maid. And then a transient wanderer with neither work nor resources. She’s not gorgeous or literate, though she works assiduously towards the latter end. She’s not religious either. But Lila’s prodigality—as I would like to think mine does—instills within her a provocative body of experiential knowledge that impels the sex-worker-turned-nomad-turned-Christian to problematize her husband’s, and Gilead’s, religious norms. After settling into a stable home-life for the first time, she can’t help but wonder:</p>
<p>What does it matter if some ignorant man nobody would even notice loses the pride he has been so careful of all his life? If somebody said to him, No work here, mister—that’s just how it was no harm intended. But it was also a great voice they heard everywhere, saying, Now, those half-grown children will be hungry and you’ll have the shame of it and there’s nothing you can do but wish at least you didn’t have to look at them. And he did seem to begin hating the sight of them. But they were bitterly loyal to him for the insult he suffered because his pride had been their pride for so many years. (111)</p>
<p>The “he” is Doane, who “turn[s] mean” because “there wasn’t much he could spare” his wife (75). Here, and throughout her eponymously-entitled novel, Lila reflects upon <em>why</em> cruelty manifests itself rather than decrying those who exhibit it, and she urges others to do the same.</p>
<p>It does matter, Lila insists, that “the world” could “go on the way it d[oes] when there were so many people living the same and worse” (112). Poverty is nothing she acknowledges—even being tired and hungry is nothing. But Lila demands that the reverends Boughton and Ames show consideration for those “only trying to get by,” so little respected that “even the wind [is] soiling them” (112). She encourages the Gilead establishment to reconsider their entrenched assumptions because, as she listens to her husband’s closest friend one afternoon, Lila realizes “Doll [is] not … among the elect” (97). This newcomer to Gilead cannot help but contemplate how, “[l]ike most people who lived on earth,” Doll—her mother-figure, her alpha and omega for so long—“did not believe and was not baptized” (97). In fact, “[n]one of Doane’s people,” alongside of whom Lila navigated her most formative years, “were among the elect.”</p>
<p>From her unique standpoint, not as a physically-disabled individual but as someone dispossessed, heathenish, and previously-nomadic, Lila thus begins to challenge the epistemic norms of Ames’ community. Her foremost task is to reconcile the reverend’s Christianity with her perspective that the <em>why</em> remains more important than the <em>what</em>. And so Gilead’s newest arrival becomes increasingly concerned with whether the Christian paradigm cherished by her husband hinges upon the spirit or the letter of its religious texts—whether appeals to loving one’s neighbor intimates hope for Doane and Doll or whether their lack of faith presages damnation, despite the threads of forgiveness and salvation woven through Christianity and its holy book. During a conversation about predestination, she even points out that the concept of the elect seems contradictory to the idea of “being saved” (<em>G. </em>152). “If you can’t change,” she adds, “there don’t’ seem much purpose in it” (152).</p>
<p>One evening, while speaking with Ames, she comes right out with it: “I’ll tell you the truth, I’m scared of Him. I’m always dreaming that Doll’s trying to hide from Him. That’s why she don’t want no grave, so He can’t find her” (<em>L. </em>142). She presses Ames about her concerns until he admits, “That’s fine. I just want to say one thing, though. If the Lord is more generous than any of us can begin to imagine, and I’m sure He is, then your Doll and a whole lot of people are safe, and warm and very happy.” In another case—and after a similar discussion—Ames asserts that “God loves the world. God is gracious,” but that he cannot “reconcile, … hell and the rest of it to the things [he] do[es] believe” (99). Lila, all the while, explains that she has “been tramping around with the heathens. They’re just as good as anybody, so far as [she] can see.” And concludes that “[t]hey sure don’t deserve no hellfire.” Lila does not ask Ames. She tells him.</p>
<p>This proves one of my favorite conversations in the entire <em>Cycle</em> because it reveals Robinson as the truly prodigal writer that she is, and—to digress momentarily—because the argument Lila makes parallels my own experience of trying to access inaccessible venues. Toiling to do so can often feel like languishing as one of the damned, lingering in a stairwell, for instance, while you hear the festive sounds of the elect standing, mingling, dancing with ease up above in a friend’s apartment. I’ll be the first to admit that I never realized how important accommodations are to so many before my own experience of existence with an incomplete spinal-cord injury.</p>
<p>In the end, Lila finds shelter and community in Gilead. And, if only tenuously, religion too, but in her own way and with her own approach that ends up teaching others as she develops it—not unlike disabled individuals who must devise strategies for maneuvering through a life evolving, I would contend for weal as well as woe, by physical and emotional challenges unknown to their able-bodied counterparts. Lila will teach her son the hymns. He will recite his verses and prayers, but only because the God Lila herself chooses to worship understands that it couldn’t be fair to punish scoundrels who happened to be orphans, or whose mother didn’t even like them, and who would probably have better excuses for the harm they did than the ones who had somebody caring about them. It couldn’t be fair to punish people for trying to get by, people who were good by their own lights, when it took all the courage they had to be good. (259)</p>
<p>So too, I tried to be “good,” and I think my parents believed this to be the case until I came out as gay to them a short two weeks after returning home for the summer once junior year ended. Of course, the decision to divulge this information was not an easy one, but then again, no pursuit of identity is. Not when you spend your dinners in a college dining hall wondering why you don’t find the ladies your best friends call to one another’s attention attractive; why you command no desire to make out with a woman while watching two peers kiss at a Friday-night party (Okay, maybe that’s because dance-floor make-outs are gross.); or why on quiet evenings when you’re alone in your room after three suitemates have tucked themselves in for the night, you Google pictures of “hot male movie stars,” and then the next time something a little more action-packed, and then the time after that something even more titillating, like surreptitiously pilfering first beer then whiskey then Everclear from your parents’ liquor cabinet when they’re not home (the irony being that I lived a banally unadventurous youth). To be honest, I enjoyed those images immensely, which proved the most devastating reality of all, sickening even, since I was still secured within the harness of the heterosexual paradigm, and just as hamstrung as those rowdy children you see restrained on leashes, frenetically attempting to escape the clutches of their walkers.</p>
<p>As all of these personal moments culminated over the course of my junior year, sleepless nights and tongue-twisted speech ensued, as did hours spent reading the same few pages of the <em>Canterbury Tales</em> while I grew increasingly fidgety, distracted, caught off guard by a book out of place, cords askew, or an undershirt whose truncated sleeves crinkled in my arm-pits. It wasn’t until I considered the situation in terms of my accident that I achieved some semblance of inner peace. First, I came out to my closest gay friend, then to several straight peers whom I knew were supporters of gay marriage—which still seemed an appreciable risk at the time—finally, to my advisors, and then I returned home for the summer, pledging to be honest with the two people who have most impacted my life. It’s true: I owe them everything I have and all that I’ve accomplished, after years of Mom taking dictation for stories rife with run-on sentences when I was still too young to write; years of Dad listening to the books I read in college while travelling for work so he could discuss them with me; years of them both fostering the passion for musical theater I cherish to this day, which was conceived when they took me to see <em>Peter Pan </em>on Broadway at age four.</p>
<p>But “How do you know?” and “Why didn’t you tell us sooner?” and “Why do you want to make your life even harder?” and “What about your health?” are the mainstays of the first and subsequent conversations we have on the subject. My parents and I both fire phatic bullets we’ll most likely always regret. Probably because I didn’t foresee that Mom, to whom I confide first, and then my father, who reads the letter I eventually write for him a week later, are confounded, hurt—and utterly unsatisfied with the answers I have for them. Frankly, because they aren’t good. How am I to explain that I just <em>know</em>, that this is not a decision but a <em>realization</em>, that this is simply who I am because, gosh, I’ve never dated and don’t talk about women and once called a sixth-grade teacher handsome?</p>
<p>In other words, I have a choice, between spilling everything—that when I first watched <em>High School Musical </em>Zac Efron evoked within me a response whose full potential I had yet to take advantage of, or that the 2012 Olympics sparked a troubling interest in Ryan Lochte, or that I made an effort to shake a certain classmate’s hand every day in high school just because he was attractive—or nothing at all and imploring them to believe this son of theirs who’s had a pretty good track record when it comes to making life decisions so far. The former option seems insufferable, and so an appeal to the mutual trust that’s always defined our relationship becomes the answer. Only this tactic founders. When their baby-boomer fears regarding the ostracism that’s sure to accrue as a result of my coming out fall on unreceptive ears, a Cold War envelopes, and suddenly I find myself the brunt of a Rainbow Scare that threatens brinkmanship at every turn. We only children tend to become the sole portfolios into which our parents invest money, so it proves all the more alarming, to all of us, when I’m deemed the “prodigal son”—a Jack or Lila with their sexually deviant pasts.</p>
<p>When I was in middle school, we met my mother’s best friend from high school at an LGBTQ-themed television station where she worked in New York City. But after witnessing her lonely struggle with cancer—and subsequent depression—alongside few friends and no family members, they yearn only for a future halcyon with ease on the heels of the adversity we’ve faced together. They don’t kick me out or damn me to hell or cut me off—since such hatefulness is alien to them—but still I feel lost in the wilderness, left to tend the filthy pigs of my psyche. Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that I turn back to Robinson. Just as Lila’s experience of prodigal poverty endows her with an epistemological cachet unknown to Ames or Boughton, so too it becomes clear that had I not undergone the accident and rehabilitation process, I would not have learned to accept my homosexuality, much less come out.</p>
<p>That is, the accident overthrew for me the despotism of normalcy that had hitherto governed my personal decisions—my conception of Pasquale Toscano. I had aspired to be normal in all those traditional ways: attend college, become an attorney, marry a <em>woman</em>, raise a family and probably construct around my house an enclosing apparatus with two horizontal rails to which one affixes tapered planks. (Otherwise known as pickets, which infantrymen once utilized to ward off the cavalry in war.) Much of these expectations, in turn, are predicated upon society’s obsessive need to control and regulate the body: you’re expected to be well enough to conceive a child; you’re expected to insert your genitals only into certain orifices; and you’re expected, at twenty-one, to be able to ambulate without a brace and certainly without a cane. Not so for me. At one point, I wasn’t even sure that walking again would ever be possible.</p>
<p>In a split-second—or the time it took for a car to careen into me—therefore, I had escaped these physiological parameters. I was living beyond the pale of rules that govern the body because my body was abnormal, which instilled within me a sense of terror and liberation in the selfsame moment. It no longer seemed so feasible that I would be able to conceive a child through natural means—and it thus didn’t seem so infeasible that I would be able to have sex with whomever I’d like. Though people try, their powers prove vastly inconsequential compared to the fundamental fragility of our human condition.</p>
<p>And so I came out, accepting, finally, that I feel certain ways towards certain people. My prodigality revealed a new way forward—admittedly, with torturous side-roads and roundabouts <em>en route</em>—at a time when I was being pulled into the past. It was Robinson who taught me to encourage, rather than suppress, my waywardness to see what discoveries it offers.</p>
<p>I am who I am because of Marilynne Robinson.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>Just when I was coming to terms with myself as a gay, disabled individual, however, a series of ostensibly unfounded claims to carrying the support of America’s silent majority coalesced into reality: Donald J. Trump was elected to be the forty-fifth president of the United States of America. A man who mocked the reporter Serge F. Kovaleski, joked about grabbing women’s genitalia, and has, since the election, signed a “religious freedom” executive order legally justifying discrimination became the leader of a country in whose commitment to individual autonomy I desperately yearned to take stock. In the aftermath of such a victory, the fortifications of my identity began collapsing like a great pile of sand without any angle of repose. I don’t believe I’m particularly unique in this regard, either. Many people felt, and feel, marginalized, expendable, even vilified amidst this nostalgic return to a bygone era of American greatness.</p>
<p>When was that again?</p>
<p>A month before the election, I return home over Washington and Lee’s long, reading-days weekend, where I catch-up with extended cousins at a family birthday party. Five of us sit in my great-aunt’s cluttered living room. Their eyes churn with disaffection and dread.</p>
<p>“We need someone who’s going to get the job done, a real businessman,” says one.</p>
<p>“We need someone who’s going to protect family values—I mean why the gays have to marry is beyond me. I don’t want another president like Obama who lit the whole White House up when it suddenly became legal. We sure as hell didn’t vote for that,” insists another.</p>
<p>“It’s not a world I want Anderson to grow up in,” yet a third nearly hisses of his son, who’s five and murmured the other day that he “loves me,” I suspect, without his parents’ exhortation and certainly not while under their supervision. His father Griffin wears an Ohio State sweatshirt, exhaling air that reeks of cigarettes.</p>
<p>“They wanna change this country. Liberals. Muslims. Black people, Mexicans, they all want to make it their own. They’re just moaning and crying around,” his sister Gingy reiterates before she glances over at me. “What do you think?” Meanwhile, I’ve been sitting on a couch that faces this cousin twelve years my senior, mentally picking over the few knick-knacks which are situated across a chaotic mantle to her rear: an encased baseball signed by Cincinnati Reds players from 1972; a picture of my family after the one still-successful wedding we’ve celebrated in five years; a dusty model of the car I’m told my great-grandparents once owned, but now with a wheel snapped off so that it wobbles if you so much as look at it. Redirecting my attention, I notice that the mole beneath Gingy’s mouth seems to have contracted; that her hair’s the color of wheat just when it’s about to be harvested; that a patina of coffee-brown skin belies her abjuration of tanning beds. Anything to occupy my mind because I’m at a loss for what to say. They still don’t know about me—that I’m gay—and I haven’t told them, partly because my parents insisted I wait till I’m sure, since they’re sure “the right woman is going to come along soon,” and partly because of, well, this. I don’t even feel like a member of the family anymore. Already, they sense my strangeness, especially since I went seven hours away to college.</p>
<p>For a moment I don’t say anything, hoping that they’ll lose interest, that this will all go away—not just them, but what I’m hearing, and their attitudes. No one moves. “Do you really want a president who imitates someone with a joint condition?” It’s a whisper, really.</p>
<p>Gingy’s twin butts in: “Maybe they get all whiny over at your college, but here we just want someone who says it like it is.” So by then, the whole conversation’s getting contentious. Feelings are about to be hurt. We’re talking about more than what we’re talking about.</p>
<p>I hoist myself up and walk through a threshold into the adjoining rec room, past this coven of cousins from the couch at the far side of what now feels like a narrow crate, thinking of what they say behind my back. Maybe they’re calling me “one of those gays” already. Probably a “fairy” when they’re feeling especially down on their luck—in the face of one pending divorce and another recently-completed, an endless routine of ballgames with nothing much else in between, unemployment, mounting debt, and the claustrophobia that accretes when couples, families never enjoy time to themselves, though none of this crowd ever leaves their hometown. It’s rural, pastoral, even serene at points, but increasingly dilapidated—closing shops, moldy siding, boarded windows, peeling paint—with Confederate flags peppering yards and cobalt political signs that appear regal until you make out the white names plastered across them.</p>
<p>All this to say that in the months before the election, I desperately needed affirmation of who I was and who I hoped to still become and the marvelousness of my prodigal being.</p>
<p>It was lucky, then, that one of those once-in-a-lifetime opportunities soon struck: I was invited to attend the Dayton Literary Peace Prize ceremony by an English teacher with whom I’d remained close since high school, particularly after the accident. She and her husband proposed that they bring me along to this celebration of literature aiming to promote peace as a graduation gift, mostly because Marilynne Robinson was named 2016’s Lifetime Achievement Award winner. Our paths were again crossing. Once more, the country’s preeminent voice on faith and the American heartland was coming into my life at the time I most needed her—perhaps more than ever before. I yearned for those elegiac turns of phrase, the grave meditations of an Ames or Glory or Lila, when it seemed that so many people were speaking on impulse alone, talking, shouting, degrading, as a result of anger and depleted empathetic faculties.</p>
<p>Events divagated towards the even more unexpected two weeks later. A close friend of the award program’s director, my former English teacher asked me, on her behalf, to introduce Robinson, I’m guessing because of my unique perspective as a millennial on novels set in the 1950s and the entire honors thesis I wrote on her over the course of my senior year—and, most importantly, because someone else backed out at the last minute. I said yes, of course—probably bellowing it over the phone with stop-sign-red cheeks and sweaty palms and legs that attempted to project me out of a rickety desk chair until my nervous system reminded those languishing muscles that things aren’t so easy these days. Frumpled but not deflated (this time), I plopped back into my seat while wondering at the news. Now it was only a matter of whether I would be able to endure what seemed to be a truly herculean task, a labor of the most euphoric kind.</p>
<p>Part of me never thought such a day would come to fruition. It couldn’t, surely.</p>
<p>And yet, that fateful Sunday before Thanksgiving indeed stuttered into the present, an evening on which I would need to plead with brittle bones and loosening hardware to heave my mildly-overweight body onto the stage of Dayton’s most elegant theater—crowned with a sky of stars that replicates the evening our native Wright Brothers first lifted off the ground—before nearly four-hundred of the writing community’s most notable voices. Tables were set with florid centerpieces of pink and vermilion, silky tablecloths, and sparkling cutlery; men in their tuxedoes and women in their ballgown ensembles of azure and chartreuse and magenta found their way to assigned seats, all of them forming a grandiose semi-circle around a single lectern placed nearly on the stage’s outer edge. Studious waiters served me steak with potatoes and asparagus for dinner, but most of it stayed on the plate.</p>
<p>I caught only a glimpse of her beforehand—gray hair shimmering to either side of a sagacious face, a simple but elegant black outfit paying homage to true Midwestern austerity, a subtle, soft-spoken radiance that engaged and intimidated with equal strides. Here was a woman whom even President Barack Obama saw fit to interview, but she clearly didn’t care a lick about proving it to anyone. I was captivated, though mindful too of my father’s admonitions against giving her cause to request a restraining order later.</p>
<p>When I stood up at the appointed time, as I forded my way through a zagging stream of chairs turned every which way in preparation for the keynote speaker of the evening, my knees were quaking from side to side, rejecting what little muscle innervation’s left, recalling, as I did, recent nightmares of trips and tumbles and blood splattering across the likes of someone like Anthony Doerr. Despite such formidable portents, however, I actually managed to wait for my own introducer to call me up. I managed to stumble up to the podium—meekly huffing under my breath as a still-paralyzed left-foot caught on the penultimate stair, even with the calf-high brace I wear to secure my ankle and minimize the chance of tripping, until a lifting of the knee managed to prop rigid toes over what has at other times sent me dashing to the floor. I re-claimed my balance by resting both hands upon the podium and at last focused on Robinson.</p>
<p>Our eyes locked; she nodded; her smile evinced the serenity that I imagine once characterized Siddhartha himself. And everything seemed to crystallize into focus—my hopes and dreams and vision for a future that had become indefinitely distant since the eighth of November, 2016—as I set my sights upon a group of thinkers and creators and trailblazers who reminded me of the perseverance and indomitability of the human spirit when invigorated by a profound love, kindness, and zeal for its co-inhabitants on this earth.</p>
<p>What now comes to mind about that night is not so much what I said, or what I felt as I was saying it, the confidence that seemed to subsume me as I was articulating what had been bursting forth from my core since the first line of <em>Gilead</em>—Ames’ gentle explanation to his son that he will be leaving soon: “I told you last night that I might be gone sometime, and you said, Where, and I said, To be with the Good Lord, and you said, Why, and I said, Because I’m old, and you said, I don’t think you’re old” (3). But what happened immediately afterward, as I stepped down, and Robinson stepped up with outstretched arms at the ready to envelope me and offer up explanation as to why, despite everything, I still adore this world of ours. We stood there, before much of the American literary intelligentsia, me with my head in the crook between her neck and collarbone, Robinson with a hand that tenderly patted my shoulder, one ensconcing the other in a moment of intimacy almost holy.</p>
<p>“Today, many people cloak bigotry in the guise of traditional values,” she commenced, and her soft-spoken mellifluousness liquefied into the very marrow of my bones.</p>
<p>I realized then with a conviction unknown to me until that evening why I read and why I write and why I return to the Ameses and the Boughtons: theirs is the community I need and the refuge I want, a second family to stress that biology only gets to tell part of my story. It seemed especially true as Robinson spoke of a divided nation, of hatred and fear, of customs and a culture still antipathetic to so many, and to so much of who I am, that writers create life-saving worlds in which countless others like me have found their homes. Patient and passive may hail from <em>patior</em>, but so does “passion”; that night, I rediscovered mine for literature.</p>
<p>The guilt of prodigality—that is, of disappointing parents, disassociating myself from a (biological) family, upturning all that people once expected of me—washed away, leaving behind only its glittering splendor, like a long-lost artefact revealed by sediment that shifts with the changing tides of a stream. Enthralled, I marveled; still amazed at its radiance, I rejoice. And so I keep the faith—in this world, this life, this country, and in me—because of Marilynne Robinson.</p>
