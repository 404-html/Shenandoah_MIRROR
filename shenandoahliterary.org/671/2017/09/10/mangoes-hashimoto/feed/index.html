					<description><![CDATA[“Mangoes” is delightfully bitter. There is nothing particularly laboring about any of the words alone, but together the poem exudes an itchy harshness through specific details such as the “Chevrolet’s tires [churning] with dust” and “the three black heads / of [her] family” as they disappear without looking back. The “shattered fruit” and the familiar and unfavorable feeling of “fruit flies [hovering] low” followed by the punchy declaration: “I don’t like Hawaii” similarly convey disturbance and the tense confusion of a child left behind. The use of the present tense effectively brings us into this scene of childhood, abandonment and stinging cuts in our mouths.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like the way the poem contradicts our expectations.  A childhood visit to your grandmother&#039;s in Hawaii--what could be sweeter or more idyllic?  Well, not this one--not this mango.  The sense of estrangement and abandonment are palpable.  The quatrains, imagery and syntax, though unadorned, combine narrative with a cinematic quality.  The ending crystallizes the bitter memory in a powerful way.]]></description>
