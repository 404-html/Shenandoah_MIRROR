					<description><![CDATA[This story is tightly tied together. I especially like the details that don’t at first glance have much to do with the progression of the story but in actuality provide information that better builds the world in which the story takes place. For example, the mention of the Mammoth burger that is served at the restaurant where Waylan works and the coinciding comment that it is &quot;really too much meat for one serving&quot; seems trivial but rather contributes to the barren wasteland that comes to represent the narrator&#039;s relationship and life with Waylan. Additionally, the tactile imagery relating to the Badlands, the location of the narrator&#039;s life with Waylan, evokes emptiness and death. The phantom pregnancy, a non-physical manifestation of a loveless relationship, loses significance over time as it never truly existed.]]></description>
