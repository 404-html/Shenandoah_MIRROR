								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>We&#8217;re Open for Submissions!</strong></p>
<p>(Please note that our reading periods have been updated!)</p>
<p><em>Shenandoah</em>&nbsp; is now open for submissions under new editor Beth Staples, and will remain open until October 31, 2018 for the fall 2018 issue. We will be open again from January 1, 2019 through March 15, 2019 for the spring 2019 issue. <em>Shenandoah</em> is excited to consider short stories, essays, excerpts of novels in progress, poems, comics, and translations of all the above. Details about all of the genres are available below and on <a href="http://shenandoah.submittable.com/submit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Submittable, which is where you should go, you guessed it, to submit</a>. <em>Please note that we no longer accept submissions by mail, with apologies to the U.S. Postal Service.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>What We&#8217;re Looking For</strong></p>
<p>The editor loves writing that stretches her imagination and way of thinking, surprises, makes her laugh, moves her, is formally interesting or challenging, defies genre, explores the confusing or uncomfortable, introduces her to new writers, thinks globally, has a distinctive voice, cares about the world, and does not assume white people are literature&#8217;s default characters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Shenandoah</em> under this new editorship aims to showcase a wide variety of voices and perspectives in terms of gender identity, race, ethnicity, class, age, ability, nationality, regionality, sexuality, and educational background (MFAs are not necessary here).&nbsp;</p>
<p>SHORT STORIES and CREATIVE NONFICTION (essays, memoir, etc.) should generally be under 8,000 words, but send Beth a query at shenandoah@wlu.edu if you have something longer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOVEL EXCERPTS will be considered with great enthusiasm. Beth plans to publish an excerpt from a novel-in-progress during each issue of <em>Shenandoah</em>, with a note from the author about their process and what it&#8217;s like to be in the middle of a big project. She knows writers at this stage need support, and would like <em>Shenandoah</em> to be a place where they can get some.&nbsp;</p>
<p>POETRY submissions should contain up to five poems. If individual poems need to be withdrawn, please put a note in Submittable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>COMICS can be in black in white or color and should be submitted as PDFs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TRANSLATIONS are strongly encouraged. In your cover letter, please include the language you&#8217;re translating from and whether you&#8217;ve been in contact with the original author.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Some Logistics</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll only consider one submission per author at a time&#8211;that&#8217;s <em>per author</em>, not <em>per genre. S</em>ubmit ONE total submission. Please decide what you&#8217;d like us to read most, submit that, and wait for a response before submitting additional work. If you submit multiple submissions, we will delete them without reading them. Submitted work should be previously unpublished in English. Work simultaneously submitted elsewhere will be considered, but we ask that you withdraw the work immediately if it is accepted (and congratulations, by the way).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We pay our contributors as much as we can depending on available funds. We believe your work has incredible value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beth is not yet sure of her average response time, but she promises she&#8217;s working hard to get back to you. Queries to shenandoah@wlu.edu will be answered politely after twelve weeks.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[A poem of loss and remembrance, to put it mildly.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I came back from the funeral and crawled<br />
around the apartment crying hard,<br />
searching for my wife&#8217;s hair.<br />
For two months got them from&nbsp; the drain,<br />
the vacuum cleaner, under the refrigerator<br />
and off the clothes in the closet.<br />
But after other Japanese women came<br />
there was no way to be sure which were<br />
hers and I stopped.&nbsp; A year later,<br />
repotting Michiko&#8217;s avocado, I find<br />
this long black hair tangled in the dirt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/blog/2018/06/poem-of-the-week-married-by-jack-gilbert/jack/" rel="attachment wp-att-6989"><img class="alignleft wp-image-6989" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jack.jpg" alt="" height="195" width="135" srcset="https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jack.jpg 190w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jack-104x150.jpg 104w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jack-100x144.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 135px) 100vw, 135px" /></a></p>
<p>Jack Gilbert&#8217;s wife Michiko Nogami died in her thirties from cancer, and in this moving poem, lacking many of the trappings of elegy, he overwhelms by understating.&nbsp; It occurs to me the proper response for a reader is awe, rather than analysis, and I feel fortunate that I can still hear Jack&#8217;s voice in it. A critic once referred to Gilbert as a &#8220;lyric ghost.&#8221;&nbsp; Seems right.</p>
<p>This poem originally appeared, as far as I can tell, in <em>Columbia,</em> then in a Tamarack Editions chapbook (1984) entitled <em>Kochan,</em> which may carry a range of meanings between &#8220;cutie&#8221; and &#8220;beloved.&#8221;&nbsp; If I&#8217;m off there, someone sing out.&nbsp; By the way, Michiko means &#8220;passing child&#8221; or &#8220;child of wisdom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gilbert received the Yale Younger Poets Prize for <em>Views of Jeopardy</em>, and his <em>Collected Poems</em> was a runner-up for the Pulitzer.&nbsp; I also highly recommend <em>Monolithos</em>.&nbsp; Fortunately, his books are available on Amazon and other outlets.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I shape this piece<br />
of curly maple into the rough<br />
form of a salmon on</p>
<p>my bandsaw, s fine, sour sweet smell<br />
of sawdust. a hint of scorching and smoke<br />
because the blade is dull, cut</p>
<p>the side shape first. then the top.<br />
And then it is recognizable, a fish,<br />
and ready for finishing.&nbsp; It quivers</p>
<p>a little at the skew chisel, flinches<br />
at the spoon bit.&nbsp; With the straight gouge<br />
I give it eyes, and with the veiner, gills,</p>
<p>and it leaps a little in my hand.&nbsp; Now<br />
that it sees and breathes, it starts<br />
to flop and suffocate.&nbsp; It becomes</p>
<p>much harder to hold.&nbsp; But it will be<br />
a long while before I learn<br />
to fashion the blood.</p>

<p>This poem of John&#8217;s appeared in <em>The Hollins Critic</em> and can still be found in <em>Sinking Creek</em> from The Lyons Press in NYC and his huge collected (600 pages) <em>Recounting the Seasons</em> from Notre Dame University Press.&nbsp; I post it not to make commentary but to bask in its simple beauty and sense of the magical and natural as one.&nbsp; John could play the trombone, the autoharp and any trout you ever met, but he crossed over the river a decade back. &nbsp;&nbsp; This week the mayflies are darting and lighting in my house, especially at night when all the lights are out but my lamp and its reflection in a glass of Aberlour.&nbsp; How could my usual thinking of him not increase and overwhelm?&nbsp; Wherever he is, corporeal or not, I hope the trout are leaving the grassy shallows to rise at an artfully tied fly.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[The frustration over losing a friend and the desire to dream]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<pre>    to see you there in the sun, shining
with your best smile, not in fact
          gone forever, waving
off my question, delighted
     with my delight, sitting
bony on my lap, which you would never
        have done in life, my
proper friend, my neglected familiar.
 &nbsp;
So this is how it’s going to be, this
    angry gratitude, this
         torment of the taken-
for-granted? Speak me a sonnet
    about Darwin and daguerreotypes
and this time I’ll try not to wake
    to the raw dazzle of morning.

                  <em>for Claudia</em></pre>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Poem selected and commented on by Jenny Bagger</span></p>
<p>Inspired by a dream former Poet Laureate of Virginia Ron Smith had, “What a Rush” exudes the complicated emotions of grief: longing, anger and regret. “What a Rush” is an elegy to late poet and professor, Claudia Emerson, who served as Poet Laureate of Virginia from 2008 to 2010, taught at Washington and Lee University, and assisted as a contributing editor for <em>Shenandoah. </em>While elegies traditionally start with a lament for the deceased, transition to an appreciation for the lost loved one’s life, and finally approach solace and relief, Smith’s elegy both fits these guidelines and challenges them, straying from the elegiac form as the speaker refuses to process his grief and embrace life without his friend.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-6905 alignright" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/claudia_emerson-214x300.jpg" alt="" width="174" height="244" srcset="https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/claudia_emerson-214x300.jpg 214w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/claudia_emerson-768x1078.jpg 768w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/claudia_emerson-730x1024.jpg 730w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/claudia_emerson-107x150.jpg 107w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/claudia_emerson-100x140.jpg 100w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/claudia_emerson-300x421.jpg 300w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/claudia_emerson.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 174px) 100vw, 174px" /></p>
<p>The speaker initially encounters the deceased with excitement and shock, creating a joyous and dreamy reunion of friends by evoking images of “the sun, shining” and “your best smile.” However, by ultimately ending not in serene consolation but in tense frustration as he realizes he can only see his lost friend in his dreams, the speaker leaves us with his pain. Smith ends with the lines, “and this time I’ll try not to wake / to the raw dazzle of morning,” conceding that he did not appreciate his friend enough in life, and discovering that he cannot ameliorate this misfortune as he will never again experience his friend anywhere other than in his dreams. By describing morning with a “raw dazzle,” Smith highlights the curious exhilaration of the speaker’s dream and the solitude of mourning, which he will fend off as best he can and try to dream as long as possible.</p>
<p><a href="https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ron-Smith-Photo-2014-243x300.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-6906 alignleft" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ron-Smith-Photo-2014-243x300-243x300.jpg" alt="" width="192" height="237" srcset="https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ron-Smith-Photo-2014-243x300.jpg 243w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ron-Smith-Photo-2014-243x300-122x150.jpg 122w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ron-Smith-Photo-2014-243x300-100x123.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 192px) 100vw, 192px" /></a>The first stanza contains near end rhymes, such as “shining,” “waving” and “sitting,” which contribute to the lyrical and dream-like effect. In contrast, the second stanza disrupts this soothing feeling with lines that end with words like, “daguerreotypes” and “morning,” which stand out in comparison, starkly emphasizing the growing frustration with the dream’s end and the realization that the speaker will soon wake up once more to a world without his lost friend. Additionally, the internal slant rhymes throughout the second stanza, such as “torment” and “taken,” followed by “Speak” and “sonnet,” and finally “Darwin” and “daguerreotype,” enhance this tension, leaving the final two lines, which lack near rhymes, as striking indications of the speaker’s desire to remember and honor the life of his lost friend.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[A thought-provoking exploration into time, life and love.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>what time is it? it is by every star<br />
a different time, and each most falsely true;<br />
or so subhuman superminds declare</p>
<p>— not all their times encompass me and you:</p>
<p>when we are never, but forever now<br />
(hosts of eternity; not guests of seem)<br />
believe me, dear, clocks have enough to do</p>
<p>without confusing timelessness and time.</p>
<p>Time cannot children, poets, lovers tell —<br />
Measure imagine, mystery, a kiss<br />
— not though mankind would rather know than feel:</p>
<p>mistrusting utterly that timelessness</p>
<p>whose absence would make your whole life and my<br />
(and infinite our) merely to undie</p>
<div>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Poem selected and commented on by Dannick Kenon</span></p>
<p>Time is probably the most essential invention or discovery of man. We are constantly thinking about it, asking for it and living by it. There is no question that time is relevant in our lives; rather, what is its importance? E. E Cummings’ <em>“</em><em>poem”</em> provides an insightful take on the significance of time. <em>“</em><em>Poem”</em> is a love sonnet that focuses on multiple aspects of the complex relationship between time and humanity, criticizing time as an inadequate, objective measurement of life and love.</p>
</div>
<p>The first stanza of “poem” asks: “what time is it?” Not only is this a fitting way to start the poem, but it also introduces the irrelevance of the question’s answer. “What time is it” hooks the reader with its familiarity and colloquialism. Everyone has heard the question, but the answer can never be objectively true. As Cummings points out, “it is by every star a different time.” Time is not synchronized across the planets or galaxies. Telling the time is subjective because it is only relevant to one’s location; time cannot be objectively true if it can be different depending on location. As Cummings writes, telling the time is “most falsely true” because time is different everywhere and nowhere tells the universal time, but it is mostly true because the subjective definition includes this variance. The first stanza of “poem” brilliantly shows time’s limitations in objectivity while the rest of the poem describes time’s inability to sufficiently measure human life.</p>
<p><a href="https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cummings2.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-6892 alignright" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cummings2-245x300.jpg" alt="" width="271" height="332" srcset="https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cummings2-245x300.jpg 245w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cummings2-122x150.jpg 122w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cummings2-100x123.jpg 100w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cummings2.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 271px) 100vw, 271px" /></a>Time may be extremely useful but can never really represent or measure a life. We record someone’s life spent alive in age. Age is nothing more than the accumulation of time expressed in years. However, years cannot “encompass me and you” because they do not account for the entire value of anyone’s life. Cummings indicates that years and age are not enough to fully account for a life’s worth. When he writes, “Time cannot children, poets, lovers tell — &nbsp;measure imagine, mystery, a kiss,” he suggests that time is only a quantitative dimension. Numbers do not represent the significance of a kiss, imagination or a mystery; rather, children, poets and lovers do. Because time is a poor representative of life, why do we waste our life prioritizing time over what really matters: love?</p>
<p>Cummings discusses time in a love sonnet to establish the often-forgotten importance of love. He reminds the audience of love’s intrinsic value. Referring to love, he writes, “whose absence would make your whole life and my (and infinite our) merely to undie.” Unlike time, one can “feel” love rather than just “know” it. Without love, living would just be not dying or to “undie.” &nbsp;&#8220;Undie&#8221; is not to be confused with just another word for living, as &#8220;undie&#8221; suggests so much more than just staying alive. &#8220;Un&#8221; is a prefix defined as the opposite of something, while die means to pass away. Therefore, &#8220;undie&#8221; means the opposite of death. Opposing death is to truly live and experience life to the fullest. Cummings stresses that love defines what it means to truly live, separating it from staying alive without love.</p>
<p>“Poem” criticizes time as an inaccurate, objective measurement and as an inadequate measurement of life. Cummings encourages his audience to remember that time is just a number. The value of time comes from us; time is not an objective truth and does not encompass life’s most important aspects. Love is not valued in time yet love, like all feelings, gives life meaning. “Poem” conveys the idea that time is not as important as love, so we should not rely on it as much as we currently do.</p>
<p><strong>E.E Cummings</strong> was born Edward Estlin Cummings on October 14, 1894 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He would go on to study at Harvard, serve in a World war I ambulance service and write renowned novels and books of poetry, including&nbsp;<em>The Enormous Room </em>and<em> Tulips and Chimneys. </em>He died of a stroke on September 3, 1962.</p>
<p>Readers can find &#8220;poem&#8221; in <em>Strongly Spent,</em> an anthology of poems from <em>Shenandoah</em> published in spring/summer 2003. It was originally published in&nbsp;<em>Shenandoah</em>&nbsp;in 1962.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Just around the corner Volume 67, Number 2
and the announcement of this year's prize winners.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On April 30<em> Shenandoah</em>: <em>The Washington and Lee University Review</em> will release its spring, 2018 issue (Volume 67, No. 2) on its website shenandoahliterary.org. The magazine is also announcing the winners of its annual prizes, the retirement of its long-time editor R. T. Smith, plus the hiring, through the WLU English Department, of new editor Beth Staples.</p>
<p>The new issue includes five stories, five essays and two dozen poems.&nbsp; Contributors include <em>Shenandoah</em> veterans David Wojahn, Stephen Gibson, Sarah Gordon, Alice Friman and Thomas Reiter, as well as newcomers John Glowney, Amy Reading, Paul Daniel and April Darcy, whose short story about the perils of modern love, “Free Fall,” is both her first publication and the winner of the magazine’s annual prize in fiction.</p>
<p>Highlights of the issue include poems about hawks, Puritans, a toad, swarming bees and a poignant consolation from Plutarch to his wife.&nbsp; Short stories deal with a child’s discovery of compassion and a bizarre look at the shadowy side of the art collecting world.&nbsp; Essays consider whales (in the sea and in <em>Moby-Dick</em>), poetry that resists the temptations of fake news and the winner of the annual Thomas Carter Prize for Nonfiction, Daniel Paul’s erudite and witty “Significant Otters,” which is about the life and charm of otters.</p>
<p>The winner of the annual Boatwright Prize for Poetry is Lisa Beech Hartz for her poem “Portrait of Sherwood Anderson, Ripshin Farm, Doris Ullman, 1928,” which depicts a meeting in Virginia between acclaimed author Anderson and renowned photographer Ullman.&nbsp; The poem was published in Volume 67, No.1 last fall.&nbsp; Hartz lives in Tidewater Virginia and directs the Seven Cities Writers Project, a non-profit cost-free workshop.</p>
<p>Daniel Paul is pursuing a PhD at the University of Cincinnati.&nbsp; April Darcy lives in New Jersey and holds an MFA from Bennington.&nbsp; Honorable mentions in poetry are Lisa Russ Spaar of Charlottesville and Austin Segrest of Alabama and Georgia, now pursuing a PhD at the University of Missouri. &nbsp;Lynn Sloan’s essay “Nature Rules” from 67, No.1 is the honorable mention in fiction.</p>
<p><em>Shenandoah</em>’s prizes are not the result of a traditional contest with a submission deadline but instead have for several decades been chosen from among the work selected for publication in the journal across a volume year.&nbsp; All works published in <em>Shenandoah</em> are eligible for the prizes in their appropriate genres, but special submissions are not considered.&nbsp; The prizes come with&nbsp; honoraria of $1000.</p>
<p>Smith has been editing <em>Shenandoah</em> since 1995, when he left Auburn University and the editorship of <em>Southern Humanities Review</em>.&nbsp; Staples comes to WLU from UNC-Wilmington, where she has been editing <em>Ecotone</em> and directing Lookout Books.&nbsp; She has previously edited <em>Hayden’s Ferry Review</em> for Arizona State University and will be an assistant professor in WLU’s English Department.&nbsp; The new schedule for submission of work to <em>Shenandoah</em> will be announced on the website in mid-summer.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[The immortality of love and the loss of beauty in death.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I DREAMED that one had died in a strange place<br />
Near no accustomed hand,<br />
And they had nailed the boards above her face,<br />
The peasants of that land,<br />
Wondering to lay her in that solitude,<br />
And raised above her mound<br />
A cross they had made out of two bits of wood,<br />
And planted cypress round;<br />
And left her to the indifferent stars above<br />
Until I carved these words:<br />
<em>She was more beautiful than thy first love,<br />
But now lies under boards.</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Poem selected and commented on by Madison Hutchins</span></p>
<p>After reading the first line of the poem, the reader is aware that the narrator is about to recount a dream. By using the word “strange” to specify how the death took place in a “strange place,” Yeats stresses the importance of home from the beginning. If he were comfortable with the idea of a foreign land, the word strange would not be utilized. Yeats initially shields the importance of the person who has died, but as the poem progress, the reader becomes aware that the narrator is dreaming about someone who he loves dearly.</p>
<p>Yeats’s lyrical dreamscape expresses one of his consciousness’s deepest anxieties. While there is no definitive meter, there is certainly a clear rhythm.</p>
<p>Using a dark and unsettling tone in the third and fourth lines, Yeats paints a picture of how the “peasants” of the foreign land “nailed the boards above her face.” Yeats emphasizes how she has died a lonely death away from home as the people of this land who do not know anything about her are the ones that bury her.<a href="https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Yeats.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6917 alignright" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Yeats-210x300.png" alt="" width="210" height="300" srcset="https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Yeats-210x300.png 210w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Yeats-105x150.png 105w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Yeats-100x143.png 100w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Yeats.png 277w" sizes="(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px" /></a></p>
<p>“A cross they had made out of two bits of wood” presents the idea that her grave is neither made nor tended by a loved one. She was found by strangers who knew nothing about her and exerted minimal effort in burying her. His references to the cross and to a planted cypress tree add a religious and spiritual component. Often placed in cemeteries because they look sad, the cypress tree further emphasizes the solemn tone of the poem.</p>
<p>The last two lines emphasize how beauty fades. This is illuminated by the shift from “she was” to “but now.” Buried in the dirt, her beauty is now unseen by the world. The narrator’s use of the word “lies” has a double meaning when he says that his love “lies under boards.” Not only does she physically lie in a coffin, but her beauty is now a lie as she will slowly decay and will no longer be beautiful.</p>
<p>At the end, the narrator turns the attention to the reader by using the word “thy.” The reader becomes even more emotionally attached to the poem by reflecting on his own first love. By traveling to her grave and carving an inscription, the narrator makes sure the world knows she is loved for eternity.</p>
<p>Yeats wrote this poem about the woman he loved, Maud Gonne. At the time this poem was written, she was traveling to France. Yeats was afraid she would die on her trip as she was predisposed to illness. The historic context shows how the poem was personal to Yeats; however, the themes are important with or without historic context.</p>
<p><strong>William Butler Yeats</strong> (1865-1939)was an Irish poet who is widely considered to be one of the greatest poets of the 20<sup>th</sup>century. The love he had for Maud Gonne was unrequited, yet she serves as the muse for many of his poems. His obituary notes that “It has been said his laughter was ‘the most melancholy thing in the world.’” “A Dream of Death” can be found in the greater body of his work, <em>The Collected Poems of W.B. Yeats, </em>firstpublished in 1903.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[An anxious look into the ambiguity of life and the question of existence.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Take this kiss upon the brow!<br />
And, in parting from you now,<br />
Thus much let me avow —<br />
You are not wrong, who deem<br />
That my days have been a dream;<br />
Yet if hope has flown away<br />
In a night, or in a day,<br />
In a vision, or in none,<br />
Is it therefore the less <em>gone</em>?<br />
<em>All</em> that we see or seem<br />
Is but a dream within a dream.</p>
<p>I stand amid the roar<br />
Of a surf-tormented shore,<br />
And I hold within my hand<br />
Grains of the golden sand —<br />
How few! yet how they creep<br />
Through my fingers to the deep,<br />
While I weep — while I weep!<br />
O God! Can I not grasp<br />
Them with a tighter clasp?<br />
O God! can I not save<br />
<em>One</em> from the pitiless wave?<br />
Is <em>all</em> that we see or seem<br />
But a dream within a dream?</p>
<p><span style="color: blue;">Poem selected and commented on by Caroline Drennen</span></p>
<p>In just two stanzas, Edgar Allan Poe interrogates perceptions of reality and existence, tackling the age-old existential riddle: is life merely an illusion?</p>
<p><a href="https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/6UNkWEWGDALwD8ZqzbzrSVpP.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6883 alignright" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/6UNkWEWGDALwD8ZqzbzrSVpP-215x300.jpg" alt="" height="300" width="215" srcset="https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/6UNkWEWGDALwD8ZqzbzrSVpP-215x300.jpg 215w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/6UNkWEWGDALwD8ZqzbzrSVpP-768x1072.jpg 768w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/6UNkWEWGDALwD8ZqzbzrSVpP-734x1024.jpg 734w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/6UNkWEWGDALwD8ZqzbzrSVpP-107x150.jpg 107w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/6UNkWEWGDALwD8ZqzbzrSVpP-100x140.jpg 100w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/6UNkWEWGDALwD8ZqzbzrSVpP-300x419.jpg 300w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/6UNkWEWGDALwD8ZqzbzrSVpP.jpg 870w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a>Focusing on parting lovers, the first stanza takes a much more carefree and lighthearted tone than the second. After kissing his lover on the forehead, the speaker accepts his “days have been a dream” (5), but confidently asserts that everything “is but a dream within a dream” (11). The overall tone of the first stanza and use of a period at the end of the last line conveys to the reader the speaker feels liberated by the notion that reality is an illusion.</p>
<p>The second stanza shifts our attention to the tangible, describing “grains of the golden sand” (15). Trying to “grasp them with a tighter clasp” (19-20), the speaker becomes increasingly exasperated by his inability to “save one from the pitiless wave” (21-22). Overall, the language is much more aggressive than in the first stanza, establishing a sense of anxiety and despair. Poe’s use of italics for the words “one” and “all” in lines 22 and 23 highlights a change in mindset, while the speaker in the first stanza is liberated, the speaker in the second stanza is suffocated by the notion that all of life is just an abstraction of our minds. Prone to intense emotion and exaggeration, this rapid shift from positivity to crippling anxiety reflects Poe’s tumultuous internal life; what is traumatic for one would be unbearable to Poe.</p>
<p>The rhyme scheme is also worth noting. While it is fairly regular – usually <em>aa bb cc</em> etc. – he does deviate from that structure at a few points, rhyming the first three lines of the first stanza and then also rhyming lines 5 – 7 in the second stanza. It is also worth noting that Poe repeats the seem/deem and dream rhyme three times. This dedication to a conventional and fairly simple structure contrasts his more overdone rhyme schemes, like in “The Raven.”</p>
<p>Architect of the modern short story, <strong>Edgar Allan Poe</strong> made numerous contributions to the American literary canon, creating an impact through his work as an editor, a poet, and a critic. One of the first American writers to become a major literary figure, Poe is an originator of horror and detective fiction as well as one of the first critics to analyze the effects of style and structure on literary works. He edited many literary journals including <em>Southern Literary Messenger</em>. &#8220;A Dream Within a Dream&#8221; can be found in Poe&#8217;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Poetry-Edgar-Signet-Classics/dp/0451531051/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1522856523&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Edgar+Allan+Poe+Dream+within+a+dream" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Complete Poetry of Edgar Allan Poe</a>.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[A striking portrait of a child's upbringing and a mother's unrelenting bravery.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<pre style="text-align: right"><em>Khong co gi bang com voi ca.</em>
<em> Khong co gi bang ma voi con.
</em>      Vietnamese Proverb</pre>
<pre>Don't you know? A mother's love
                   neglects pride
              the way fire
neglects the cries
       of what it burns. My son,
                             even tomorrow
you will have today. Don't you know?
                      There are men who touch breasts
                            as they would
        the tops of skulls. Men
who carry dreams
       over mountains, the dead
                             on their backs.
But only a mother can walk
                     with the weight
of a second beating heart.
                            Stupid boy.
        You can get lost in every book
but you'll never forget yourself
                        the way god forgets
his hands.
                When they ask you
                      where you're from,
tell them your name
        was fleshed from the toothless mouth
                              of a war-woman.
That you were not born
              but crawled, headfirst––
into the hunger of dogs. My son, tell them
                      the body is a blade that sharpens
         by cutting.</pre>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff">Poem selected and commented on by Trang Nguyen</span></p>
<p>I first looked Ocean Vuong up because he was an author born in Saigon, Vietnam who now resides in New York. &#8220;Headfirst&#8221; is exactly what I expected from such heritage &#8211; a powerful piece about maternal love that is closely related to the Vietnam War.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">The opening lines from a Vietnamese proverb which means &#8220;Nothing can compare to rice and fish/ Nothing can compare to a mother and her child&#8221; catch my attention, as it not only signifies a poem rich in maternal affection but also points to a traditional approach in portraying such a highly elevated relationship in Vietnamese culture. Yet the fragmented form evokes exotic and uneasy feelings. On the first read I thought Vuong wanted to imply the fracturing effect of the war, but perusing it the second time gave me the impression that the mother &#8211; the narrator &#8211; was probably making emphasized statements too.<a href="https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ocean-Vuong_TomHines-768x960.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-6835 alignright" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ocean-Vuong_TomHines-768x960-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="258" height="323" srcset="https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ocean-Vuong_TomHines-768x960-240x300.jpg 240w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ocean-Vuong_TomHines-768x960.jpg 768w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ocean-Vuong_TomHines-768x960-120x150.jpg 120w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ocean-Vuong_TomHines-768x960-100x125.jpg 100w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ocean-Vuong_TomHines-768x960-300x375.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 258px) 100vw, 258px" /></a></p>
<p>The poem can be separated into two parts that have the same structure, starting with &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know?&#8221; and ending with &#8220;My son,&#8221; in which the later is dominantly longer and more eloquent. Tension builds up as the piece goes, with the explicit clues such as &#8220;fire,&#8221; &#8220;skulls,&#8221; and &#8220;the dead&#8221; cumulate at &#8220;a war-woman.&#8221; Here the mother makes it clear that she is talking about a pregnant mother who participated in the war along with her male comrades, a story often neglected when it comes to glorifying their bravery, determination, and heroism. She is grounding a bold statement of self-awareness but also feminism.</p>
<p>Yes, the war appears brutal &#8211; it is &#8220;the hunger of dogs,&#8221; but the mother&#8217;s fortitude and profound love for her child surpasses it all. The poem couldn&#8217;t end in a better way &#8211; the last two lines are too packed with daunting intensity to be neglected. The mother affirms her son&#8217;s sense of self, saying that ever since his birth he has been indomitable, that he has headed straight into the war, and that his steadfastness is not to be questioned. The image of &#8220;a blade that sharpens by cutting&#8221; ties to the theme of war, while at the same time underlines the toughness.</p>
<p>The lesson that the mother is giving in &#8220;Headfirst&#8221; is no new story in a context of Vietnamese upbringing culture. It is not the transparent motherhood, however, but rather the son&#8217;s admiration and love for his mother that lingers in my mind. Such a beautifully heroic portrait of a mother must have come from a deep and unquestionable fondness.</p>
<p><strong>Ocean Vuong</strong> currently serves as an Assistant Professor in the MFA Program for Poets and Writers at Umass Amherst. His debut poetry collection, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Night-Exit-Wounds-Ocean-Vuong/dp/155659495X"><em>Night Sky with Exit Wounds</em></a> was a winner of the T.S Eliot Prize, the Whiting Award, the Thom Gunn Award, and the Forward Prize for Best First Collection.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[An investigation into the eerie remnants of an abandoned house and something gone awry.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>He was a big man, says the size of his shoes<br />
on a pile of broken dishes by the house;<br />
a tall man too, says the length of the bed<br />
in an upstairs room; and a good, God-fearing man,<br />
says the Bible with a broken back<br />
on the floor below the window, dusty with sun;<br />
but not a man for farming, say the fields<br />
cluttered with boulders and the leaky barn.</p>
<p>A woman lived with him, says the bedroom wall<br />
papered with lilacs and the kitchen shelves<br />
covered with oilcloth, and they had a child,<br />
says the sandbox made from a tractor tire.<br />
Money was scarce, say the jars of plum preserves<br />
and canned tomatoes sealed in the cellar hole.<br />
And the winters cold, say the rags in the window frames.<br />
It was lonely here, says the narrow country road.</p>
<p>Something went wrong, says the empty house<br />
in the weed-choked yard. Stones in the fields<br />
say he was not a farmer; the still-sealed jars<br />
in the cellar say she left in a nervous haste.<br />
And the child? Its toys are strewn in the yard<br />
like branches after a storm—a rubber cow,<br />
a rusty tractor with a broken plow,<br />
a doll in overalls. Something went wrong, they say.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff">Poem selected and commented on by Lindsey Hewitt</span></p>
<p>Poetry is written to invoke emotion—regardless of whether those feelings are negative or positive. Sometimes, the emotion readers draw from a poem are not those intended by the author.&#8221; Abandoned Farm House&#8221; by Ted Kooser plays with the ambiguity of emotion through the background of abandonment. Kooser utilizes repetitive personification, as well as the diction of desertion, creating an eerie and mysterious mood throughout his poem.<a href="https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/TedKooser_NewBioImage_NoCredit.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-6815 alignright" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/TedKooser_NewBioImage_NoCredit.jpg" alt="" width="286" height="289" srcset="https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/TedKooser_NewBioImage_NoCredit.jpg 286w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/TedKooser_NewBioImage_NoCredit-148x150.jpg 148w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/TedKooser_NewBioImage_NoCredit-100x101.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 286px) 100vw, 286px" /></a></p>
<p>Rather than using people to narrate his poem, Kooser allows the derelict objects left in the farmhouse to tell their story and the story of their long-gone owners. The shoes, the bed, the “Bible with a broken back” tell their stories as pieces of information left behind in seemingly hasty eviction; the personification of these objects paints this picture. Despite their poverty, the family left “jars of plum preserves/ and canned tomatoes sealed in the cellar hole.” Finally, someone says it, “Something went wrong, says the empty house/ in the weed-choked yard.”</p>
<p>Kooser also uses eerie diction to cast readers into this obscure scene. Using words like “broken dishes” and “broken back” of a Bible abandoned by a “God-fearing man” begin to hint at something awry. Kooser continues to use darker diction such as “cold,” “lonely,” and “weed-choked.”</p>
<p>Kooser, however, did not intend for such mystery to permeate his poem. He “thought [it] would be obvious…that the man, the head of the household, had failed at farming and with his family abandoned the farm” (Kooser 12).</p>
<p>The combination of this uncanny diction, along with the darkening accounts of the abandoned objects creates a mood of ambiguous mystery, leaving readers with more questions than answers as the objects rise in unison, “Something went wrong, they say.” Kooser, however, intended readers to quickly solve this mystery, proving the split between intended and found meaning within poetry.</p>
