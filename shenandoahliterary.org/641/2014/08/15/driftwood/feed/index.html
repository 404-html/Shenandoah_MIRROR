					<description><![CDATA[My favorite part about this story is the pacing. It is fast enough that the story never has a chance to get tiring, yet still slow enough that the build-up and reveal at the end come at just the right time to put the most power in the surprise. Pacing is pretty hard to get just right, but this story managed it. I loved how my mind jumped around throughout the story, first inferring that John was the murderer and then later trying to comprehend who exactly John is. 

The dialogue in this story also works very well. I enjoy how it allows the story to progress naturally, without sounding forced or unrealistic. That can also be hard to do, but it is done well here. It also characterizes John and William, and by allowing their characters to develop through dialogue the story avoids &quot;telling&quot; rather than &quot;showing.&quot; 

I also think the images of snakes are great throughout. They aren&#039;t overdone, and they really work as symbols here. I love it when short stories such as this one are able to use deep symbols, as I have found it can be difficult to fit such symbols into so few words. I read John as the personification of the snakes -- hidden away but potentially dangerous -- and I really liked that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Elliot,

Thank you for the kind words. The story owes a lot to James Lee Burke, I think, and should you want bigger and better keep an eye out for JBL&#039;s In the Moon of Red Ponies.
