					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever read a piece that blended literary analysis and personal introspection in such a coherent and interesting way. Perhaps it&#039;s because of the resurgence in popularity of the brooding romantic hero, brooding romantic vampire even, but this work really resonated with me, especially in regards to the dangerous cultural misconception that the &quot;truest&quot; kind of love is tumultuous and dangerous. I loved the look at the different definitions of passion, all ended up being remarkably relevant: idealization of a romantic love that makes us suffer, and ultimately, turns us into passive participants, following wherever the passion leads us.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I appreciated this author&#039;s conception of love as a transformative force, in the sense that it inspires a desire to change. I thought it was great to parallel this with the literal transformation that takes place as one becomes a vampire in the Dracula universe. In general, I found that comparing the Dracula romance plots to the author&#039;s own romantic history provided a unique prism, through which I could view relationships in a way I never had before. I came away from the piece with a new understanding of the shadowy side of love stories.]]></description>
