					<description><![CDATA[Hi Sara:

Thanks for the thoughtful comment. I think it&#039;s less about pulling oneself up by one&#039;s bootstraps and more about the fact that we can&#039;t change other people. Ultimately, everyone makes their own choices, and we have to let them. It&#039;s not that the hiker didn&#039;t want to save himself, only that he couldn&#039;t. And I certainly don&#039;t believe that people who move to the Caribbean aren&#039;t truly living.

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m intrigued by the ending idea you present in this piece that people need to have the will to save themselves. It seems that in today&#039;s world there is a common sense of codependency and general reliance on other people. But, I like this idea you present that in the end people have to pull themselves up by their bootstraps. The idea that personal will is the strongest thing someone can possess really stands out to me and I think it is something that needs to be instilled in the American population more. Along these lines, do you think the hiker didn&#039;t want to save himself? And, I&#039;m curious to know if you view people moving to the Caribbean islands, people like your father, as people who no longer want to continue on in the real world, and instead escape to a simplistic life where they don&#039;t have to truly live. Is moving to the islands just another way of ducking down the branches and wandering into the abandoned sulfur mine? In the end, is it just another way of mummifying yourself in the yellow fumes of monotonous living?]]></description>
