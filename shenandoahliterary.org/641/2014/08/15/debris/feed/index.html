					<description><![CDATA[A high quality story; goes beyond the Noir genre and hold up as a literary piece. Only one thing troubled me from a plot perspective. As nashe16 indicated, we can&#039;t be absolutely sure that Campbell is the killer, (though in all likelihood he had it coming). However, at one point it was stated that two young women had disappeared. One of them was found dead and the other had not been located; made me wonder if the other poor woman might be stuck in his underground bunker with Cambell&#039;s corpse. That dampened the satisfaction I might have felt in watching rural justice meted out. All in all, great characters and masterly writing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There is something hilarious and almost charming about the idea of a rifle-wielding old woman who takes the law into her own hands. There is also something disturbing about the idea of a woman who insists on giving burials to the animals that drown in her pool but is also willing to shoot a man simply because she suspects him of being criminal. This is one of my favorite elements of Noir: nothing (aside from the film) is black and white. The reader isn&#039;t sure whether Campbell is actually a criminal, and therefore whether Emily is justified in her actions. What&#039;s more, we even begin to question our own moral compasses as we attempt to justify the murder of a young man. Noir thrives in uncertainty, and &quot;Debris&quot; left me unsure.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Today you can find my short story, Debris, in the pages of Shenandoah: The Washington and Lee Univ&#8230;. This is my third publication in the US, and by far the most significant of them. It is also the title story for my forthcoming short fiction collection (from Biblioasis, in 2015). I think it&#8217;s one of the strongest stories in the book, and will likely stay that way unless I go on a tear and write some baffling new stuff before we go to press.
