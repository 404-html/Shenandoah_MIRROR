					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this very entertaining short story. I enjoyed every moment. Especially, the dialect which is not an easy task. I have been reading Jesse Stuart and Wendell Berry since I was pubescent (now forty something). The dialect solidifies the &quot;picture&quot; in my mind each character in the story.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Really enjoyed this story and I also did not think I would finish it at first. The voice worked well, some nice surprises, like the way he speaks to the two gossipy women ‘Love renders blind,’ I said, ‘and if you dusty bitches ever find it, feel free to differ with me.’ - made me laugh. In fact this piece does a lot of table turning so I appreciate the solid underpinning of craft, done with a light touch.
Although early on I realized that Bill had probably killed his wife, I was surprised that Lloyd was feeding his own wife to Bills pigs and that was what was making them so happy - also very funny. 
Very enjoyable read.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This story reminded me of &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;, with Lloyd as Lennie. I found his character so much more sympathetic than the typical noir criminal. I don&#039;t mean to imply that all noir villains are the same or that they don&#039;t incite some empathy in me, but Lloyd&#039;s simpleness made his crimes more tragic. It was like reading about a child destroying his favorite toys, and really engaged me as a reader.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a story that kept me reading. When I began it, I had no clear intention of finishing; I just wanted to pass a few minutes But it hooked me, and I just had to keep going. I truly enjoyed reading this story, and it&#039;s even more enjoyable a second time, now that I can spot some of the subtle moments of foreshadowing. The written-out dialect, so often obnoxious, works well, and I found myself surprised at how much I liked the voice. Overall, the language, the words used and the way they&#039;re put together is exceptional. The pacing is very effective as well, slowly laying the groundwork before the rapid successive revelations at the end. But aside from the literary structure, I had real emotional engagement with the story. By the end I felt slightly stunned and more than a little delighted - my main thought simply, &quot;What a good story.&quot;]]></description>
