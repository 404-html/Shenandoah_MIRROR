					<description><![CDATA[This story is so elegant. The transition from the girls&#039; ducking into the motel room to Davie&#039;s flashback is wonderfully exact, as is the development of the burned retina into the psychological blot. Thank you for sharing such a powerful story.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As I read this piece, I was struck with how, if a few minor words were changed, the story I was reading could be taking place at any time period after a war. Though the flash fiction is called &quot;Church Retreat, 1975&quot; and marks the end of the Vietnam War, I felt as if the two girls could have been on a 2015 church retreat and the two ex-soldiers could have just returned from Afghanistan. These overarching ideas of PTSD, young women being kidnapped, and the power of God show just how far our country has come and how much it still very much remains in the past. This aspect of the piece makes it relatable, and all the more terrifying, especially with all of the recent stories that have appeared in the news. Overall, it reminds me a lot of a combination of the Joyce Carol Oates story, &quot;Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been&quot; and a war veteran story. I felt the trepidation for the two young women&#039;s safety like I did when reading Oates&#039; short story, while also feeling Davie&#039;s fear. Bravo for being able to convey the fear of the potential victims and perpetrator at the same time and for bringing the reader into the story world in such a short amount of time.]]></description>
