					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] April happens to be National Poetry Month.  It is October so I am either very late or very early with this news.  If you are reading this post, you are likely either a lover of poetry or a skeptic. If the latter, then I would suggest you read Elena Aguilar&#8217;s article, &#8220;Five reasons why we need poetry in schools&#8221; from the April 2013 issue of Edutopia.  In short, she suggests that it increases literacy and tightens community.  If you are already converted then you will be pleased to know that Josh Camp Brown, a new member of the English Department at PDS has been actively integrating poetry into his courses.  A published poet, Josh will team up with Elijah S., a PDS senior, to teach a poetry intensive study course in spring 2015. In the meantime, all can enjoy Josh&#8217;s latest published poem, published in Shenandoah, &#8220;Mandolin in White Wood, Grain Count.&#8221; [&#8230;]]]></description>
