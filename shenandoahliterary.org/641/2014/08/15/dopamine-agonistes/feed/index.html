					<description><![CDATA[I agree that this is a powerful story-- one of the most powerful in the issue. It works because Lorne&#039;s struggle is universal. Some readers won&#039;t be familiar with Parkinson&#039;s, but can empathize with Lorne&#039;s desire to be needed and to be useful. Sometimes it doesn&#039;t work out, and I admired how complications developed organically from his attempts at helping people. Allowing Lorne his small victory with the cat was a fitting end. Everyone needs an inflatable cat victory now and again-- it boosts the spirit, so that we can be ready when bigger problems come along.]]></description>
