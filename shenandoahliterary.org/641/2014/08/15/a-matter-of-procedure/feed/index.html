					<description><![CDATA[A disturbing and entrancing story.  I particularly liked the themes of expectation and disappointment-- the narrator&#039;s unfulfilling affair with Underwood failing to alleviate her boredom, the unresolved nature of the crime (why butterflies?  We&#039;ll never know), Roger&#039;s moving to the other side of the AA circle, and of course the narrator&#039;s finally securing the attention she has always wanted by assuming the characteristics of Annabel only to be haunted by the fear that she can lose control of the fantasy at any moment.  These cycles of desire and anti-climax are very evocative of classic film noir; I was reminded especially of the romantic narrative in Bogart&#039;s The Maltese Falcon, which after an hour and a half of build-up resolves not in the hero and heroine riding off into the sunset together but with the reveal that the love interest killed the hero&#039;s partner, and the realization that he will have to turn over the woman he cares for to the police, with the full knowledge she could be executed for the crime.  It&#039;s a bleak but emotionally arresting ending, and I feel that the motif of unfulfilled expectations in this story did an excellent job of linking the piece to the noir tradition.]]></description>
