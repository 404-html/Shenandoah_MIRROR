					<description><![CDATA[While this is a rather complex analysis of the origin of panic attacks, citing roots in biology and the metaphysical construction of the universe, the most intriguing reason given (to me, at least) is a disconnect in language. The author explains how her partner suggested that her panic attack in Toronto may have been the result of not knowing the language of the province, consequently making her feel more like an &quot;outsider.&quot; While I&#039;m certain that there is more to it than that (or else no one would ever be able to visit a foreign country, and panic attacks would never occur in one&#039;s home region), language is absolutely an elemental factor in panic. Some of the most common nightmares include the dreamer not being able to talk or scream; keep in mind, being able to make noise isn&#039;t necessarily linked to being saved in these dreams, but the mere experience of not being able to express one&#039;s self, whether it&#039;s practical or not, seems to be enough to induce total and real fear. Sufferers of panic attacks often have trouble articulating why they panicked in the first place; is it because they honestly have no idea, or because they simply lack the tools to adequately interpret it and put it into words? 

During the bird&#039;s attack on her bike helmet, the author wants to demonstrate to the bird that she means no harm by screaming, but knows it will do no good, as she and the bird--two different species--speak different languages. Is this the real heart of panic? Knowing exactly how you feel, exactly what you want to say, and suffering the frustration and horror of being unable to make others understand?]]></description>
