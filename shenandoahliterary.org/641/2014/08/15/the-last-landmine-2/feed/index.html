					<description><![CDATA[This is a story that explores the concept of love thoroughly, both in its tenderness and its violence. At the center of the plot--bridging the primary and secondary male characters--is Slavinka, the love interest of both Salko and Boban. Although Slavinka is married to and legally bound (especially in a country like Bosnia) to Salko, she spends the entirety of the story in the company of Boban, and the man to whom her affections are actually tied is unclear. At their wedding, Slavinka already carries Salko&#039;s child (a shotgun wedding, perhaps?), while Boban cries in the back pew, and in the aftermath Salko tries to &quot;keep her from thinking about Boban two streets over and what her life could be.&quot; This procession of images suggests that Slavinka&#039;s heart really belongs to Boban, a suggestion that the author calls into question when Slavinka, later, finds &quot;Boban&#039;s touch on her shoulder too friendly for the circumstances.&quot; Such thoughts eventually turn violent--mirroring the revolution surrounding them, evidently the reason that Slavinka needs Boban&#039;s shelter to begin with--when Boban becomes captor rather than benefactor, forcing himself on Slavinka and  perhaps even lying to her about the continuation of the war. But in even in his violence Boban displays love for Slavinka: he seems ashamed of his actions, won&#039;t meet her gaze, even subtly offers her ways of escape. 

On the other end of the spectrum, Salko shows nothing but frothy, fairy tale love for his missing wife, completely devoid of suspicion or bitterness about her torn allegiances. He sprays her perfume and dances with the shape of her body, recreating all of the senses of their life together save touch. Salko and Boban catch Slavinka in between their different forms of love, both equally suffocating in their rights, much like the three are trapped in war-torn Bosnia. Reflecting the subtle (for the most part) violence of her love affairs and overt violence of the street, Slavinka wishes only &quot;to get on with the dying or the killing.&quot; The reader gets the sense that, tragically, the surrounding violence only bolsters the internal, and but for the fighting, Slavinka would be no more than a shape for both men.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a  wonderful, sensitive piece N. T. Arevalo has written about a war torn place that could be anywhere, and, in this case, Bosnia. About the effect of killing and dying on people who love each other.   Arevalo is a writer to watch for big talent is there.]]></description>
