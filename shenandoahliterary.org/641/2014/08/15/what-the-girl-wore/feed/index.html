					<description><![CDATA[This poem is incredible. The amount of power in this single stanza is extraordinary. 
The title foreshadows a very different scene than a funeral, but the beads as &quot;a fingertip of efficient bruise that we already knew about anyway&quot; carries both - as Kiki describes it - &quot;darkness&quot; and a sense of mystery in the children&#039;s familiarity with the sight. 

This is the kind of poem that leaves you both breathless and gasping for more.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a poem that masters both immense darkness and surprise. I can see why Poetry Daily also chose to feature it over the coming week. It is a perfect example of letting vivid description and imagery lead in a poem, rather than drama or the emotion. This garners greater impact at the end when the subject is revealed. For a short, simple poem, it packs a macabre punch that is rather poignant for the Noir issue.]]></description>
