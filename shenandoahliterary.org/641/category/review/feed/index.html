<p><strong>Hunting For Clues With Ghosts</strong></p>
<p>Rebecca Makkai’s novel <em>The Hundred-Year House</em> invites more than one reading. It may be finished in one long day on the beach, but this is no beach read; given the complex storyline, it requires commitment and patience from the reader. Its unconventional, inverted timeline means that Makkai provides the answers before her audience knows to ask the questions. In this treasure hunt of a book, a Marxist scholar, an unemployed broker, various artists, caretakers, and aristocrats shift their identities and perspectives, at the same time raising awareness of class issues, the subjectivity of what constitutes art, and domestic abuse.</p>
<p>The novel is presented in three sections, starting with the year 1999 and regressing first to 1955, then 1929, and terminating at the turn of the 20th century. The points of entry into the story narrow as well: beginning with the perspectives of multiple characters, by the end the reader has only a glimpse into the single narrator’s thoughts. Only the setting&#8211;an old-fashioned mansion on the edges of Chicago&#8211;stays somewhat constant while Makkai manipulates every other factor in an accelerated series of plot twists. Characters will unexpectedly disappear, die, betray one another, and change their faces before the reader’s very eyes, often simultaneously. It is a token to Makkai’s skill that so many key events can happen concurrently without muddying the understandability of the plot.<br />
The house begins and ends as the home of the Devohrs, an old-money family of Canadian aristocrats who “sat firmly in the second tier of great families of the last century,” with a brief phase as an artists’ colony. The ever-changing residents reveal their secrets in reverse; the fates that await the characters are introduced before the characters are, a risky, but well-executed, structural choice that makes reading the novel something like being handed the treasure and told to find the clues.</p>
<p>Despite its heavy reliance on concept, <em>The Hundred-Year House</em> has credible characters. Many are chameleons and some are simply con artists, but each insists on occupying multiple identities throughout the course of the story. The Marxist academic Zee, for instance, at the center of the first section, lives in her wealthy family’s carriage house in her mother’s estate. Meanwhile her husband Doug, supposedly trying to make an academic name for himself by writing about the obscure poetry of Edward Parfitt, a one-time occupant of the artists’ colony, secretly earns his salary from writing formulaic young adult novels. Doug’s predicament&#8211;“his stopover in the land of preteen fiction was only the latest in a wretched chain of events”&#8211;sums up the communal situation of every character who walks through the house. They have all found themselves in unlucky circumstances, by fault or by fate, and they’re trying desperately to claw their way out by “crawling out of [their] own skin.”</p>
<p>Those characters who remain exactly how they’re introduced are in fact the outliers against a host of people trying to be someone else. As the novel moves further back in time, the masks become more complicated, the lies less easily identifiable and their consequences more absurd. By the end of the first section, it is clear that no one is who they say they are, and everyone has ulterior motives.</p>
<p>However, the reader’s willingness to suspend disbelief with the eccentric, often irrational characters sometimes wears thin. Some of the characters’ decisions&#8211;for instance, changing one’s name multiple times over the course of a lifetime for the “fresh start”&#8211;lead the plot not to the impossible, but at least to the improbable. Part of the absurdity may be attributed to the fact that (in keeping with their generation) the characters in the first section are more like overgrown adolescents than adults. But the rest seems to exist solely so that Makkai can tie the dozens of threads throughout the story into a nice bow at the end. However, the reader can forgive her this. The answers to the mystery are so poetically justified that one can’t blame Makkai for her shortcuts.</p>
<p>The novel is a mystery, yes, but the author fulfills the promise made in the first paragraph: “For a ghost story, the tale of Violet Saville Devohr was vague and underwhelming.” That sentiment goes for the so-called haunted house as well. A number of mysterious nighttime bumps and shattering windows with origins unknown feature in the book, but although the reader waits patiently until the very end for the suicidal ghost to nudge the characters over the ledge of madness on which they all seem to be perched, the only spirit haunting the characters is excessive alcohol intake. The spooks are minor and never significantly handicap the believability of the story, yet are distracting enough to notice. Makkai’s half-hearted attempts to personify the house as somehow responsible for the destruction that occurs within its walls come off as unnecessary and slightly kitschy.</p>
<p>Perhaps <em>The Hundred-Year House</em>’s greatest strength is its satirical humor. Makkai pokes fun at her character’s attempts to fit themselves into various molds so subtly that an unobservant reader wouldn’t catch it, would in fact nod along in understanding to the very actions that Makkai mocks. As most of the characters are either academics or self-proclaimed artists (“We’re awfully lucky to do what we do,” declares one painter to her philistine benefactor)&#8211;each representing an institution that merits some satire or interrogation at least&#8211;there is an abundance of pretention and self-delusion ripe for ridicule. Even so, just like their real-life counterparts, the pompous professors and painters gluing garbage to canvas and calling it “art” aren’t unlovable. The reader may even feel affection toward them, like one might towards a toddler bent on becoming an astronaut. Makkai expertly paints her characters as slightly ridiculous, but not to such an extent that the reader dismisses them.</p>
<p>The first read can certainly be at times frustrating; without any inkling of what the treasure is, the reader may become irritated with the ever-growing pile of seemingly irrelevant clues. But Makkai does an admirable job creating a world appealing enough, and characters intriguing enough (although many are of the “love-to-hate” variety), that the reader will persevere anyway. And that’s a good thing, because when the treasure finally is uncovered, the reader will want to start the hunt all over again.</p>

		<title>AND SHORT THE SEASON (Norton, 2014) by Maxine Kumin</title>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The majority of poetry readers—even the most voracious of us—have  gaps in knowledge about poets we’ve been meaning to experience, poets we know we’ll appreciate, but for reasons that evade us, we have not gotten around to. For me, Maxine Kumin falls into this category, and her eighteenth book of poems, <em>And Short the Season</em>, has inspired me to visit her abundant body of work. Accompanying my vacancy is a bald guilt and regret—I should have read the Kumin’s poems long ago. My one bittersweet solace is that I am sure I will return to Kumin’s work, for she is a master: the clarity with which she weaves her lines, her acoustical complexity, and her evocative resonance have already taught me how to write better poetry.</p>
<p><em>And Short the Season</em>, the title taken from early sonnet innovator Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey’s “The Frailty and Hurtfulness of Beauty” in pre-Shakespeare Renaissance England, is a beautiful collection, and its five sections begin with the rich, nearly Hopkinsian “Whereof the Gift Is Small,” a phrase that extends Kumin’s connecctions to Howard’s Renaissance poetry and reveals her formal range and mastery of sound:</p>
<p><em>And short the season, </em>first rubythroat</p>
<p>in the fading lilacs, alyssum in bloom,</p>
<p>a honeybee bumbling in the bleeding heart</p>
<p>on my gelding’s grave while beetles swarm</p>
<p>him underground . . .</p>
<p>Kumin’s poem becomes bittersweet as its opening acknowledgment of fecundity gives way to chthonic transformations of horses, creatures she held dear. The poem questions the gift of life, but deepens the motif by ending with a nod toward the transitory nature of human perception and the inevitable end to all life.</p>
<p>Kumin’s concerns are not limited to mortality. In poems such as “The Path, the Chair,” the narrator takes a walk, recalling Hazlitt, Coleridge, and Wordsworth—especially the latter and his long strolls, during which he “humm[ed] his lines as long as his feet / could hold the rhythm on the path,” a meta-statement about metrics, of course, but a line that vectors seamlessly into the narrator’s own traversal through her farmland, a landscape partially wild, partially manicured, but one so beautiful that it becomes a kind of cathedral, or even a heaven, in which Kumin worships with a Heaneyesque felicity—“My resting place, from which I watch / the rhubarb swell, the peas inch up, / the early spinach break through clods.” The worship is in the saving of the farm, this microcosm of flora and fauna, this ecosystem Kumin and her family spent forty years to create:</p>
<p>the restored fields,</p>
<p>the rescued dogs, the ancient horses</p>
<p>named Genesis and Deuteronomy,</p>
<p>Eden, Praise Be, Hallelujah, and the farthest field. . .</p>
<p>our catholic homage to an afterlife</p>
<p>we like the thought of but don’t believe in.</p>
<p>Pieces such as “Our Mantle” deal with environmental concerns, and the poem is all the better for its inclusion of the word “petrichor,” or the scent that rain makes on parched earth, one my favorite words. Indeed, much of Kumin’s work centers on the Earth and its myriad forms and pairs a diction luminescent and unrestricted. For example, in a poem called “Indian Pipes,” a piece that orbits those strange, white, dangerous-looking plants otherwise known as ghost flowers, Kumin writes, “when the white wraiths grew among bitter russulas / and lactarias, mycorrhizal with numinous trees,” a line that resembles others in this book, wherein science is conflated with the mystical.</p>
<p>Kumin’s book is best read in several sittings. Her vision does not indicate fragmentation so much as a deeply complex mosaic of the personal and the political, the “natural” and the man-made worlds. Poems range from pieces about gardens to Liz Taylor, from doghouses to William Carlos Williams. I keep returning to these poems, as no matter their subject matter, no matter their form, the poems in <em>And Short the Season </em>all telescope outward to embrace the universal while dwelling in empathy and human experience.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reviewed by R.T. Smith<br />
<a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/641/files/2014/09/wolf.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-406" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/641/files/2014/09/wolf.jpg" alt="wolf" width="138" height="207" /></a>Urban Waite’s third novel, a crime thriller set in the small towns and woodlands of Washington State, unfolds the tale of a young sheriff’s deputy with a saddened and shaky marriage, a past damaged by the loss of his mother to illness and his former-sheriff father to crime and prison, as well as an uncertainty about his own vocation. Along his journey to answer the questions of the past and future and the ordeal of coping with his newly-paroled father’s return to Silver Lake, Bobby Drake must contend with a sour bulldog of a DEA agent, shifty local lawmen and a pair of obsessed escaped cons who have a huge financial stake in the shadowy movements of Patrick Drake and what he might have salvaged from the drug smuggling spree that put him behind bars before the complexities of <em>Sometimes the Wolf are</em> launched into action.</p>
<p>The storm of the novel gathers slowly, delayed by a kind of double McGuffin – first, in the figure of a lone she-wolf that has shown up to attack livestock, and then as an attractive Fish and Wildlife Management officer named Ellie, whose job it is to band and observe the wild intruder. Unfortunately, the wolf disappears even as a metaphor for two-thirds of the book and remains more an artificial frame and a vague emblem for the father, who is also a free-ranger, and intimations of more than flirting between the deputy and the conservation worker are misleading.</p>
<p>However, the book’s inexorable plot is driven as much by the conviction of agent Driscoll (a standard but well-drawn shabby obsessive cop) that the former sheriff has stashed substantial illicit funds in the wilderness, and the ruthless pursuit of that swag by two near-Pinteresque villains, Bean and John Wesley (a name somewhat distracting, whether derived from Methodism, Wild West stories or Flannery O’Connor). These two all-purpose villains are almost pure appetite, but lack the charm of even the most savage predator. Not at all in the mold of, for instance, McCarthy’s Chigruh, Bean is the nearly uncaused cause, whose blend of motivated and random venom seems to come from no complexity, and his sidekick is a step behind, more aware perhaps that the victims are people, but he&#8217;s less developed. Despite their schematic construction and viable but predictable dialogue, Waite has mapped out their bloody trail through the novel so they can surprise and alarm the reader with their sudden appearances and resourcefulness. “Serviceable villains,” they provide the narrative with a necessary hostage-pursuit-revenge-rancor, while those who are busy negotiating and equivocating their lives on the threshold of the law furnish the more engaging dynamic of the story.</p>
<p>At its best, <em>Sometimes a Wolf</em> is an exploration of fathers and sons – the tentative deputy Bobby and his adroit but misguided father, the deputy’s miscarried son, Patrick Drake’s own father, a likeable loner who lives off the grid but emerges to play an important role in the unpacking of the central conundrum, which is: &#8220;Where’s the hidden money, who’s it meant for and who’s going to get it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The women in the story – Ellie, Bobby’s wife Sherri, the waitress Cheryl – have similar names which even scan identically, and they serve stock purposes, though the wife’s suffering is no dismissable matter, as she is abducted, abused and terrified in well-rendered riveting fashion. Other flawed characters include the current and anything-but-innocent Sheriff Gary and his henchmen and the noble but earthy ex-con Maurice. Assorted waitresses and quick victims come and go, but the swirl of uncertainty about who is operating at what relation to the spirit of the law provides the story with its moral twists and thresholds. That and the question of forgiveness, even when the offense is great and the offender a blood relation.</p>
<p>The early intimations of an environmental dimension don’t bear the anticipated fruit, as ecological concern vanishes in the whirlwind of violence, and the wilderness hovers and simmers without coming excitingly alive. The plot includes just enough sexual tension and action to ensure that dimension of life is not overlooked, and the topography is revealed, though not animated, as in the works of similar writers Ron Rash and Tom Franklin. The back matter of the paperback version suggests other comparisons, but Waite’s style lacks the blistering imagery and philosophical reach of McCarthy, the persuasive rawness of Elmore Leonard and the tortured motivations of Dennis Lehane’s principals.</p>
<p>What might raise this story from the readable to the gripping and consequential account that a less brisk book might have aimed for is a more committed exploration of Bobby’s backstory and its haunting particulars. The events of the past are told, but their transforming impact on the protagonist is often too pat to make him unforgettable. His remorse and doubt are believable but not adequate to show his heart or what he sees when he looks into the mirror.</p>
<p>Waite’s dialogue is usually credible but lacks the brittle wit of veteran law enforcement officers, and the author&#8217;s commitment to writing in long sentence fragments (though sometimes adding to the pace) can be irritating and never quite succeeds in converting a manner to a captivating style. Some sudden shifts in point of view lead the reader less artfully than might be hoped, and the early gaffe of repeated information about twelve-year-old clothing suggests this novel might have been more carefully edited.  However, Waite can write, and when he is not impatient and trusts his eye, his management of action is pace-perfect.</p>
<p>The themes and setting, general arc or uncertain evidence and solution, mystery and resolution are rewarding, and with the opening scenes of the savaged calf and concern about the packless wolf, expectations rise. If they culminate in a nearly formulaic fashion when Bobby Drake sees his father literally more clearly than before and perhaps understands his responsibilities about that seeing for the first time, it’s a close miss. The novel is neither sluggish or timid, and Waite has most of the tools to compose a more refined and fiercely realized novel. It would be a mistake to give up on him on the basis of <em>Sometimes the Wolf.</em></p>
