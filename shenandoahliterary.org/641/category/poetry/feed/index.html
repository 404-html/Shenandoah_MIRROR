								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A house of cards has<br />
no window. No kitchen,<br />
no tarts. The queen, with all<br />
her hearts, holds no more sway<br />
than a four. The king, equal<br />
to a deuce or that knave,<br />
the town crier with a bell,<br />
announcing a royal beheading.<br />
This is the house of the joker,<br />
trickster of the dark carnival,<br />
scepter of misrule, dedicated<br />
to the chop. This is the house<br />
of whimsy—a balancing act—<br />
built to fall.<br />
I shuffle the cards.<br />
Time for my nightly game<br />
of solitaire, that pasteboard<br />
horse I’ve ridden for fifty years,<br />
the deck sticky with constancy.<br />
A dog barks, a clock ticks.<br />
Black five on a red six, red<br />
seven on the black eight.<br />
Wait. The aces are loading<br />
but the one-eyed jack who<br />
waxes his golden hair will<br />
not turn up. The queen of clubs<br />
drops a flower on my grave.<br />
She is my mother. The king<br />
holds a sword to his side,<br />
threatens to use it. Relegated<br />
to the box, the joker, reader<br />
of fortunes, smirks.<br />
Great<br />
Aunt Sadie too told fortunes,<br />
visited once a year at night<br />
to hawk her policies. Peed<br />
with the bathroom door open,<br />
bloomers hanging a bunting<br />
between her knees. Grandpa’s<br />
sister, Grandpa’s shame—<br />
bucktoothed Sadie, old<br />
as the old country, skin like<br />
boiled chicken, gray hair<br />
wild around her head as if<br />
she stuck her toe in an electric<br />
socket. Mama rolls her eyes—<br />
bedtime. Oh, the danger. Not<br />
to be there when Aunt Sadie<br />
reaches into her black purse,<br />
that mystery squatting at her feet<br />
like a patient filing cabinet,<br />
big and bottomless as the trap-<br />
door to forever. See how<br />
she hauls it into her lap, un-<br />
zips, rummages, then<br />
pulls out that little red box,<br />
slips off its rubber band to<br />
snap around her wrist, winks,<br />
and shakes out the cards.<br />
Look<br />
at any deck of cards. See<br />
how the joker prances about<br />
masquerading as a jester<br />
to jolly the royals—silver<br />
bells on his cap, pointy shoes.<br />
The joker’s grandfather, no un-<br />
forgiving Puritan like mine,<br />
but Tarot’s Fool, so busy<br />
poetizing flowers he’d follow<br />
his own babble off a cliff.<br />
Measure the fall: Fool<br />
to faker to jester, jester to<br />
joker—free to say anything<br />
and excused in advance. Lord<br />
of anarchy, writer-in-residence,<br />
boss of all fall down.<br />
History<br />
engraves in spirals, the needle<br />
buzzing like a doorbell—<br />
a summons one needn’t answer.<br />
The joker will take care of it<br />
from the peephole of his privacy.<br />
Here’s a story:<br />
On the Pyrenean<br />
marble top of the pedestal table,<br />
Madame Irène lines up the cards.<br />
It is Paris before the war,<br />
Madame’s grand salon—<br />
the white hexagonal room<br />
where six Aubusson tapestries<br />
illustrating La Fontaine’s fables<br />
fill the six panels of the walls.<br />
Ladies put down their cups,<br />
press to her side, or kneel<br />
on the water-silk voyeuses<br />
to watch. Navigating the room,<br />
the light from thirty scented<br />
candles settles on our heroine,<br />
and all chat stops. What can<br />
the cards tell of the future<br />
of this house and the Madame<br />
whose worth will founder<br />
in scandal? The Master<br />
has retired to his collection<br />
of porcelains, the only love<br />
he has left to love. The joker<br />
will not show his face tonight.<br />
He doesn’t have to. His best work<br />
is done in the dark.<br />
Aunt Sadie<br />
lays out the cards on Mama’s<br />
kitchen table—the usual ten-<br />
card spread. Her six-dollar<br />
watch flashes in the light<br />
of the overhead bulb. Her eyes<br />
flick over the cards. She is<br />
reading her fortune. Aunt Sadie<br />
doesn’t know from marble tops<br />
and gilt-legged chairs, nor has<br />
she ever heard of La Fontaine,<br />
but she knows fable. She knows<br />
slow and steady wins the race<br />
and when to gather up the cards,<br />
shuffle, and lay them out again,<br />
for like the princess and the pea,<br />
she’s made uncomfortable<br />
by tests of purity. The queen<br />
of spades—even at six I know<br />
the old-maid card when I see it—<br />
she tucks back into the deck.<br />
She is looking for someone else.<br />
And when he shows up as he<br />
inevitably does, she kisses the air,<br />
gathers up the cards, buttons<br />
her make-do sweater, clicks shut<br />
her purse and is gone.<br />
The joker<br />
appreciates odd visitations:<br />
the race-car driver invited<br />
to dinner, the one Madame<br />
will run off with—the children<br />
abandoned or taken from her,<br />
grandchildren she’ll never see<br />
who’ll die in the camps. The joker<br />
is intrigued with consequences—<br />
what happens when someone<br />
just drops in. Lately he has taken<br />
to drop in on me. Could be<br />
I remind him of someone—<br />
skin loosening on the bone,<br />
hair gone wild. He’s begun<br />
whispering to me at night:<br />
past accomplishments, his best<br />
of the best. I tell him he’s just<br />
gathering material for a sort of<br />
New &amp; Selected and I want<br />
no part of it.<br />
After Sadie died,<br />
a cedar chest was discovered<br />
in her rented room. A hope chest<br />
filled with hand-embroidered<br />
pillow slips, sachets, nightgowns,<br />
lacy lady things still waiting<br />
as they had for seventy years,<br />
ever since she’d been sent out—<br />
too ugly for marriage even to<br />
the Sauerkraut &amp; Pickles man<br />
on the corner of Orchard<br />
and Delancey. Yes, sent out<br />
to scrounge up a living selling<br />
insurance, climbing tenement<br />
stairs, knocking on doors for<br />
her fifty cents. But always<br />
she believed he would come,<br />
dazzling in his full regalia—<br />
the Jack of all hearts, the Jack<br />
who would turn around at last<br />
to take her as she was, holding<br />
out the leaf he held in his hand<br />
as if he had just picked it up<br />
that day in Central Park, the first<br />
leaf of autumn when the world<br />
pours down, sad and most beautiful.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democracy<br />
— Côte d&#8217;Ivoire</p>
<p>Dervishes and snake husks blown<br />
against the broken quills of grass<br />
along the ditches like lost prayers,<br />
and the gendarmes, come so quietly<br />
into the holy place of your home.<br />
There might be ink on your thumb.<br />
They might even drop your body<br />
back in front of your home to warn.<br />
Or the limbo of makeshift morgues<br />
and months for proper papers,<br />
and though your family know your<br />
face like a braille poetry of hurt,<br />
they cannot take your body home,<br />
they cannot anoint you for the dust.<br />
Your simple white shoes — where<br />
the blood was caked, your wife<br />
could only pay the rag of her grief<br />
across your shoes until they shone.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Across the bomb-crater marsh<br />
Insignia, bayonets faintly flash,<br />
Privative buckles pinch spirited flesh.</p>
<p>Men grip their guns like the golden bough,<br />
Under fire scatter or flow.<br />
Tired boots through gravel and bone plow.</p>
<p>The officers shout out their paces<br />
Over barbed wire, the dead in pieces,<br />
Cursing the frightened smooth boys’ faces.</p>
<p>Long the descent into death’s great halls<br />
Where hungry Persephone wails.<br />
Some pause in a shrine of four roofless walls,</p>
<p>Some may examine the blue of the sky<br />
From the mud where they lie,<br />
But not one has lost his way.</p>
<p>In grainy photographs, bobbling film<br />
We glimpse the smoke-hooded Sibyl loom.<br />
Momently they rise and charge, past hope, past harm,</p>
<p>The silent human storm.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>to Jennifer Reeser</p>
<p>Did you like slasher flicks, their doomed coeds<br />
In eighties’ leg-warmers, six-packed dates<br />
Loaded for a weekend’s fun with sex and sleds</p>
<p>And skis? But not in the Magnolia State,<br />
Where rows runnel the delta’s silt, not snow,<br />
Seeds scattered like mascara-flecks on Kate,</p>
<p>Kimmie, eyes taking on a raccoon’s glow,<br />
Or madmen’s, who pant behind pine trees,<br />
Then smile as blood begins its muddy flow,</p>
<p>As yours did, opened to snaked tubes each week<br />
For chemotherapy, which didn’t work.<br />
What else was there to do but watch old movies, . . .</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>My nappy curls of hair fell to the floor<br />
At your shears’ cut. “Nappy”? Friends white<br />
As cirrus clouds, as blinding-clean wordwork,</p>
<p>Or empty appointment slots, which added bite<br />
To moods that swung from stars to thickest mud<br />
Despite the meds and opiated light:</p>
<p>The doors stayed locked, despite the thud<br />
My fists gave for our last scheduled meeting:<br />
“It’s this fucking economic crud,”</p>
<p>You’d flung over red wine disappearing<br />
From its box at your last Christmas party . . .</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Belovèds are the ones we hurt the most,<br />
More than ourselves—bang! a gun, you’re toast,<br />
And what will your poor mother think? Lost—</p>
<p>Herself and you in a last breath. Your dad?<br />
We searched address books, but nobody had<br />
A clue. Halfway yours, his Creole blood,</p>
<p>“In the old sense . . .”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>How could so many talents live as one,<br />
Given our frail flesh: your clouded kidneys<br />
Replaced but with no savior; my sad lungs<br />
Wheezed silver on your easel, the low stars giddy</p>
<p>In an El Greco dusk. Your drawled iambs<br />
And pawn-shop Strat? Fuck <em>ave atque vale</em>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Evening light steals in amongst the tulips<br />
like a pickpocket’s hunger. Grain in the streets,<br />
Midwest goldrush, tractors towing in trailers<br />
piled high, long wains shaking their way in.<br />
Half a horse shy of being a one horse town.<br />
One plastic &amp; foam deer per yard, shot to pieces,<br />
a hundred wounds in each, a hundred arrowpoints,<br />
a braille of absences clustered near the vitals.<br />
I’d sooner trust my hand with a live cobra<br />
than a razor-crowned broadhead—a stainless steel<br />
pyramid of 3 or 4 blades meet at the tip.<br />
No way to pick it up to screw it to the arrow.<br />
No way to leave this town, they sometimes say,<br />
except for the army. And at the road’s end—<br />
doesn’t really matter which road, does it,<br />
it’s every road—a truck on cinderblocks, &amp; baggies<br />
that go a hundred a gram, the quiet of snow settling<br />
to the bottom of a Mountain Dew bottle, a slash<br />
of want, of hunger, I cannot guess at. Here’s one way<br />
it works—the only bar in town runs it out the back.<br />
So yeah, the sheriff says he knows who’s cooking,<br />
but that doesn’t seem to stop anyone, until a fire<br />
blows out the windows, &amp; yellow tape borders<br />
the property. Here’s another: hauled around<br />
in a car behind a tow truck, so if you’re stopped,<br />
it’s someone else’s. I’ll be a tourist here all my life,<br />
in this town without a stoplight, beneath streetlights<br />
orange as sorrow, where the abandoned theater<br />
beams a light of names of those who disappeared<br />
onto a cracked screen, where the water tower echoes<br />
with the passing years, &amp; the weed grows innocently<br />
beside the corn. I’ll be a tourist this evening, too,<br />
half rumor &amp; half lost hour, I’m dewclaw<br />
&amp; peepshow, a cat’s extra life no one’s even heard of.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8211;for G. M. Ford</p>
<p>The only reason I survived<br />
Is I was sitting by the door.<br />
The diner was the kind that thrived<br />
Before the Second World War&#8211;</p>
<p>You know the sort: the tables chipped<br />
Like the mugs of coffee boiled so hot<br />
It stripped your tongue, and no one tipped<br />
The waitress since she always got</p>
<p>Your order wrong. So all of us&#8211;<br />
Jacob and me, the Carlson boys<br />
At the counter, George (the wrinkled cuss<br />
Who hogged the four-top to annoy</p>
<p>Corlene because she wouldn&#8217;t date him)&#8211;<br />
We looked around as the door squealed<br />
Open. A woman tall and slim<br />
Eased in; her tawny trench coat concealed</p>
<p>Her curves half-heartedly, like a card<br />
Shark who likes to gloat. She glanced<br />
Around the diner, glaring hard<br />
At every face as though romanced</p>
<p>Badly by each guy there. The cold<br />
Increased when she took off her hat:<br />
Her hair fell reddish-blond as gold<br />
Lightly rinsed in blood. But that</p>
<p>Was just the start&#8211;she opened up<br />
Her trench coat, showing us the dress<br />
She wasn&#8217;t wearing, though her cups<br />
Ranneth over. I must confess<br />
I can&#8217;t tell why I looked away—<br />
Maybe a life of getting nowhere<br />
With women made me wary. They say<br />
A gun is just a tool, but I dare</p>
<p>Anyone in danger to trade<br />
A revolver for a socket wrench.<br />
The way the flicky light played<br />
On her coat&#8217;s lining with a French</p>
<p>Suggestiveness showed me her curves<br />
All added up to forty-five.<br />
Her Colt emerged like a gift that deserved<br />
To be admired. But staying alive</p>
<p>Means I&#8217;ve often had to cut<br />
My pleasures short&#8211;I dove out<br />
The door. Before it started to shut,<br />
I heard her silver pistol shout</p>
<p>Death at everyone inside.<br />
Not looking back, I ran like the devil<br />
Was about to brand my sinful hide.<br />
Into a vacant lot (its gravel</p>
<p>Imitating banana peels<br />
Beneath my soles) I dashed, climbing<br />
The chain-link like feathers were on the heels<br />
Of my wingtips. But my timing</p>
<p>Was a little shook&#8211;I swan-dived splat!<br />
In the mud on the other side. A zing<br />
Zipped by my cheek as I rose, so flat<br />
As a flounder I went, quickly squirming</p>
<p>Around the corner of the drugstore.<br />
That crazy dame&#8217;s gone nuts! I thought,<br />
Grabbing my thirty-eight. I abhor<br />
Violence, especially when I&#8217;ve caught</p>
<p>Its attention, but I&#8217;m prepared<br />
(My only Boy-Scout quality).<br />
They say a private dick who&#8217;s scared<br />
Is no damn good. Well, I pity</p>
<p>Whoever wouldn&#8217;t be: for all I knew,<br />
That diner was now full of the brave.<br />
(Jacob had tackled at the U,<br />
And the Carlson boys were known to behave</p>
<p>Like Vikings after too much mead.)<br />
Somehow this woman seemed familiar,<br />
Now that I&#8217;d had a chance not to bleed.<br />
Was she the angry moll of a mobster</p>
<p>I&#8217;d put in a cell or on a slab?<br />
An ex-girlfriend I&#8217;d promised to wed?<br />
As my foggy brain tried another stab,<br />
A bullet nearly cleared my head&#8211;</p>
<p>I dropped behind a garbage can<br />
(As if that would stop a serious slug),<br />
The only cover I had. To scan<br />
For my Valkyrie, I eased my mug</p>
<p>Around its edge. There she stood:<br />
Her tawny trench coat closed (too bad),<br />
Baring only her Colt (not good)<br />
And her snowy teeth. You lousy cad,</p>
<p>She suspired in a voice more smoky<br />
Than Lilly&#8217;s Lounge after last call.<br />
Bet you thought when I went to the pokey<br />
You&#8217;d never see me again. The doll</p>
<p>Laughed like nylons tearing. Such a big<br />
Man, huh? Toss that gun out here.<br />
Now you&#8217;re gunna die, you pig!<br />
Pork wa? I asked, feeling fear</p>
<p>Freeze my blood a drop at a time,<br />
Staring at the girl with the xanthous tresses<br />
As my snub-nose clattered in the slime<br />
Of the street. I&#8217;ll give you three guesses,</p>
<p>She said, then went: Tap-tap-tap-tap-ding!<br />
Tap-tap-tap-tap-ding! That struck a bell:<br />
My former secretary! Our fling<br />
Had ended when I failed to quell</p>
<p>Her urge to be my sidekick. I work<br />
Alone, I said, repeating what I&#8217;d told her<br />
That long-gone day some client jerk<br />
Had asked, What&#8217;s her rate? A colder</p>
<p>Tone frosted her words: The whole town<br />
Made me a joke when you revealed<br />
My own attempt to track down<br />
The Stocking Killer was just a shield&#8211;</p>
<p>Since I was the Stocking Killer! She tore<br />
More lingerie with her cackle. I fixed<br />
My eyes on her gun muzzle and swore<br />
I wouldn&#8217;t let myself get nixed</p>
<p>By the black period it planned to punch<br />
Into me. Okay! I cried; no fuss&#8211;<br />
You can be my partner! Playing a hunch<br />
She&#8217;d forgotten that I&#8217;m ambidextrous,</p>
<p>I raised my right hand higher while<br />
My left (hidden behind the can)<br />
Drew a derringer (my smile<br />
Grew wider as her Colt began</p>
<p>To lower) from my ankle holster.<br />
You&#8217;re right, I continued; I need someone<br />
Who knows the criminal mind to bolster<br />
My business. You won&#8217;t have to run</p>
<p>A typewriter any more! She grinned<br />
As bright as a blizzard. I&#8217;ll always see<br />
Her lovely face as I put some wind<br />
Holes in her trim midriff. To be</p>
<p>Or not, I sighed; I will not boff<br />
You again, alas. I fired down<br />
Once more to be sure. Then I walked off<br />
In the rain and thought: I hate this town.</p>

<p>Master of ceremonies, hack actor<br />
With red wig and smudged rouge,<br />
Declaiming with ample spittle how<br />
Corpses were displayed in butcher shops,<br />
Laid on the racks. The chorus of churls<br />
Mimics heroically drunk and questing<br />
Brass bands and flags.</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>The mind sings itself blind,<br />
A story of hex and fir forest,<br />
A lost child’s song about home,<br />
Dimly thatched and with a kitchen garden<br />
Of strangely fertile loam,<br />
Where cabbages unfold, turnips tumor soil,<br />
Chicory fields indite to a nation.</p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>Trains lurch out again, search the old tracks.<br />
Ink-and-paper crumbs furtively<br />
Seed the way we came.<br />
The elect are recognized,<br />
Megaphones register the renovation;<br />
Lictors with fresh sticks drive the crowds on:<br />
Flesh to be hated and consumed.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>for Ellen</p>
<p>It leapt through a dashboard louver<br />
onto the passenger seat.  Grasshopper,<br />
delicate as a dress accessory you might wear.</p>
<p>Did I own a neon windbreaker that color<br />
sixty years ago, could I have been<br />
that gauche?  And if not, where<br />
have I seen that shade of green before?</p>
<p>Through the traffic of four or five towns<br />
and the skirting of three bays and a few coves,<br />
this virid bug kept taking me to memory&#8217;s<br />
greener venues: the we-can-do-it<br />
of the garden&#8217;s pumpkin leaves, for instance,</p>
<p>and among the leaps of recollection,<br />
how The North Sea forbids grasshoppers<br />
further passage than Hoy, tallest of the Orkneys.</p>
<p>And for no other reason I can fathom than<br />
this bug&#8217;s range of motion, before its italic limbs<br />
finally sprung it out the open window<br />
I recalled that day going past the drive-in theater</p>
<p>when we saw the man who&#8217;d had a stroke like yours,<br />
the one I held up as an example while he pushed<br />
along the sidewalk by the state road, struggling<br />
himself back toward a younger self.</p>
<p>But failed, apparently, since I&#8217;ve seen him<br />
a few times later in a motorized wheelchair,<br />
a hankie-sized red flag waggling his presence<br />
in the breakdown lane.  I kept that to myself,</p>
<p>and it was only yesterday I could tell you<br />
he was on his own two feet again at the drugstore,<br />
gray as we are, but almost dashing with<br />
his cane and belted leather coat.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unlike the grotesque bonnet<br />
worn at church, the apron<br />
is more a second cousin<br />
to the humble scarf in winter.<br />
The apron would never say<br />
“So what” to you. She’s agreeable<br />
as a kitchen mantle with ripening fruit.<br />
A sponge when it comes to stink:<br />
splatter of fish scales and fish guts,<br />
the errant strafe of grease<br />
from angry skillets, the teary onion’s<br />
grief and stutter. In middle life,<br />
the apron aspires to stand before<br />
sinners and saints and carve<br />
verses on stone: <em>mon coeur mis à nu</em>,<br />
she’ll tattoo on your chest.<br />
She’s your last line of defense<br />
against burnt anchovies,<br />
the wide net draping<br />
over the frightful forest,<br />
the canvas cradling the boxer’s face,<br />
a makeshift dressing<br />
on a playground wound.<br />
The apron is the fulsome embrace<br />
for a brother shoving off—<br />
the one with empty pockets<br />
coming home to the damp, dark<br />
folds of her familiar stink.</p>
