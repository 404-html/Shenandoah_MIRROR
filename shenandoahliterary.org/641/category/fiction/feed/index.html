								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lorne Taggart stood at his front door waiting for the mail. He watched the surface of his coffee vibrate with his hands, concentric circles rippling out from the center of the cup, then another vibration, this one in his front pocket from his phone. It was Jenny: Don’t forget to check the mail. TELL ME if there’s news! She had said the same thing when she left the house thirty minutes earlier. The text was to give him a visual reminder. Jenny was adapting far better than he was to his difficulty with planning and remembering. For her it was a matter of extra prods and hints—treating him like one of the kids, basically. For him, the present was acute and dim at the same time, while the future—even the very near future—was like a tall tale he didn’t believe. The phone shook out of his hands and dropped face down on the concrete porch. It took him two tries to curl his hands around the phone and retrieve it. When he did, he saw that the front was badly cracked.</p>
<p>He lifted a yellow leaf that had drifted into his cup and dropped it, soaking, into the bushes that lined the front porch. Until now, he had always loved late September. Now he struggled to hold the details, the evenings and mornings that were cool enough for jackets, the high temperatures still reaching into the low 80’s during the day. The way a great, purposeful drift of Monarch butterflies wafted through central Oklahoma during their yearly migration to Mexico, blowing orange evanescence like spice across the lawn flowers of Oklahoma City. Fat green caterpillars appeared and ate the green leaves of waning summer annuals. The sunflowers reached their peaks, five, six, seven feet-high faces peeking above fence lines and nodding from the sides of roads, bent like old men with heads too heavy for their necks. Suicide grasshoppers flew against car windshields. Garden spiders showed up, weaving their zigzag webs and hanging ziplines across light poles and porch corners. Smaller spiders sent themselves floating, wrapped in streaming web, across the air to land on the places they would make their homes. Pumpkins and gourds and stalks of Indian corn appeared on roadsides from vendors who opened the backs of their pickups and sat in lawn chairs waiting for customers with the radios blasting sports talk radio from inside the cab.</p>
<p>Oklahoma University football season&#8211;that had always been what made fall really great for Lorne. Of course, Oklahoma State University football season started, too, and the state turned crimson and orange with the rivalry, the north half up from the Cimarron River skewing orange for OSU, more OU crimson to the south. Car flags, ball caps, t-shirts, and jackets announced allegiances everywhere you looked, and even the rock stations played the college fight songs. Between a Foo Fighters double play, there would be the martial cadences of “Boomer Sooner,” raising in him the old disappointment of his own high school football career replaced quickly by the long habit of allegiance and its steady rewards.</p>
<p>The kids had been back at school for a month. His eldest, Cade, would attend his 4th grade class in flip flops and shorts until a hard freeze came. His little ones, Emily and Ryan, on the other hand, rushed the change of season with new clothes still too warm for the in-between days of early fall, wearing their new hoodies and corduroys the browns and reds of changing leaves. The department stores were already jacked up with Halloween décor and costumes, rushing October to get to November and December and a Christmas season that still felt remote for all but the most forward-thinking planners. Lorne had been that sort of forward thinker once—he had prided himself on noticing, throughout the year, what his kids were into, and picking up the perfect gift on spring and summer sale, not waiting until mid-December to try and come up with a decent show from Santa, not leaving it all to his wife, like his kids were somehow not his business. But this year he couldn’t imagine Christmas. He couldn’t even imagine Halloween. Would he make it that long? Not that the disease would get him that fast. No, it would take years and malingering years.</p>
<p>He pushed open the screen door and saw the mail truck pull to a stop a block down. Jenny was at work, the kids at school, everyone hustling with determined cheer through the morning routines he used to be up and out of the house too early to see. Rushing out the door, Emily yelled, “Have a good day, Daddy!” Cade wrote a note in his blocky scrawl, and left it on the dining room table propped up by a salt shaker: “DAD—Don’t Forget to Blow Up the Halloween Cat Today. Remember my Slumber Party!” A peck on the cheek from his wife, everyone adjusting without comment to his new status as stay-at-home Dad , now that work was out of the question.</p>
<p>He didn’t think he would ever adjust. Mornings in the oil fields, watching the shadows shorten under the pump jacks, coffee steaming the windshield of his truck, rounding up oil workers who had spent all night at the casinos, that was what mornings were supposed to be. Now he sat on his front steps, staring at plastic bats hanging from the neighbor’s trees. It was too early for Halloween decorations.</p>
<p>The mail carrier approached smiling. He had bleach-blonde hair and muscular calves. His mirrored aviator shades showed Lorne his own broad frame hunched on the steps.</p>
<p>“Morning.”</p>
<p>“Nice day.” Lorne stood up and took the bundle of white envelopes. “No bills in here, I hope.”</p>
<p>“Gave them to your neighbor.”</p>
<p>“That’s the way,” Lorne grinned, pushing like a body caught in quicksand against the stiffness of his facial muscles. “Have a good one.”</p>
<p>He watched the mail carrier cross his lawn and head up his neighbor’s front steps before he looked at the mail. There were some bills. A <em>National Geographic Kids</em> with a stern blue parrot on the cover. Sales flyers for the usual crap. And an envelope from the Social Security Administration. To Lorne Taggart. He walked inside, dropped the other mail on the dining room table on top of Cade’s note. Poured himself another cup of coffee. Then he returned to the porch and tore open the envelope. As he read, a high-pitched sound startled him, a sound which he realized had come from his own throat. His hands trembled and he felt his face muscles tighten to a mask. It was official—he was fully disabled. The disability check would be very decent, not much less than he had made when he was working. Good news.</p>
<p>They had waited months for this official notification, but he and Jenny had been told that total disability was a foregone conclusion with a diagnosis like his, a young man in the prime of his working life with three small kids at home. So money wouldn’t be a problem. Was he supposed to feel relieved? He smacked a mosquito against his bare leg, gratified by the swiftness of his reflex, and said aloud, “When total disability is good news,” and then, startled by his own angry voice, concluded the thought in his head, you know you’re screwed.</p>
<p>In the back of the fridge there were some old beers. He drank one. He drank another. His phone buzzed and he knew without trying to peer through the phone’s cracked face that the call was from Jenny, but he ignored it. He thought about the guys at the well site, wondered what old Eugene was doing without Lorne there to roust the young ones, get them to work. There was a new guy, Lorne had heard, someone to take his place. Lorne decided he’d go by, just say hi to everybody, tell that new guy some of his tricks of the trade. Shoot the shit. On his way to the garage, he stopped in the utility room, breathing in a mealy odor from a big bag of cat food and the underlying sweetness of fabric softener. He jammed his feet into his boots, bracing himself against the washer and struggling with the laces for a minute before he gave up and left them untied.</p>
<p>In the garage, he climbed into his truck. The radio blasted a car commercial that he switched off. Then he sat in the garage and let the motor run. In the gray light, he made out the bicycles hanging from the ceiling, the weed eater in the corner, and the boxes of holiday stuff piled by the door. The big, plastic black cat that Cade wanted him to blow up was in one of those boxes. It really was too early to decorate, but Cade had been begging.  Exhaust began to cloud the air. He could just keep sitting here.</p>
<p>He wouldn’t feel it. He had known a girl in college, a girl madly in love with his best friend, Chris, who, when Chris dumped her, killed herself this way. She had tried to change her mind, but hadn’t made it. Her parents found her in their garage slumped in front of the door that led to the kitchen, her hands outstretched toward the door handle. What was her name? Kimberly. A journalism major. Lorne had been planning to ask her out when she got over Chris. That stupid girl. He pressed the garage door opener clipped to the driver’s side sun visor and the sun poured in. He backed out the car and turned on the radio.<br />
~*~<br />
It was barely 10 AM, but the parking lot of the casino was crowded. Lorne had strolled through this particular one looking for AWOL oil workers, whom he usually found glassy-eyed and desperate at the slots or playing Texas Hold ‘Em with someone who had the oil worker’s paycheck over on his side of the table. The carpet stretched into the expansive interior, swirling blue and yellow patterns lead his gaze like an eternal mirror at a funhouse. Once inside, it felt like the middle of the night. Although the place was huge, with fifty-foot ceilings suspending car-sized lighted banners, the air was stale with cigarettes and human sweat. Lorne couldn’t imagine the air conditioning bill. He found the bar easily. Elevated and surrounded by a wall of backlit glass, it looked like a liquid color wheel, morphing lights and humming like a spaceship ready for takeoff. Lorne bought a Jack and Coke. He smelled like car exhaust and the realization made him ashamed.<br />
A short woman with wide hips and huge breasts inside a tight T-shirt strolled up and stretched her small frame on tiptoes until she was sitting on the stool next to Lorne’s. “You believe that Baylor game?” she said.</p>
<p>Lorne realized he was wearing his OU hat, which invited these kinds of conversations. The old Lorne would have swung around and started laying out his theory about Oklahoma’s defensive weaknesses this year, but today he just nodded and sipped his drink.</p>
<p>“I’ll give them one thing—it takes balls, coming up here year after year acting like they’ve got a snowball’s chance.” She tilted her head to look at him. “You just lose a bundle?”</p>
<p>“Worse,” Lorne said.</p>
<p>“Me, too,” she said. She had chunky blonde streaks in her brown hair and a diamond stud in her broad nose. “My son, he’s got to have a uniform for T-ball, and I was hoping to make the money to get it for him, but damn if I didn’t just lose what I had.” Lorne didn’t say anything so she continued. “What do you mean by worse, anyway?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t lose my money.”</p>
<p>“Oh.” She appeared to think about it. “So you have money?”</p>
<p>She wasn’t going to ask what was worse. Lorne shrugged. That was good.</p>
<p>“Then maybe we could help each other out. Start the day off with a bang.” She gave him a hopeful smile, lascivious and embarrassed at once, and Lorne rose in his seat.</p>
<p>“Excuse me,” he said.</p>
<p>The sun was bright when he left the building, and he shaded his eyes until he found the row of cars where he was pretty sure he’d parked his truck. He noticed a rusted out Honda with a bumper sticker that said, “You’re just jealous because the voices talk to me.” Inside, a small face watched him from under the steeply rounded bill of a crimson OU cap much like his own. He stopped.</p>
<p>The boy within was six or seven, the same size as his youngest, Ryan. When Lorne approached the car, the boy grew alarmed and his face dropped below the level of the window. Lorne looked inside. Who the hell leaves a kid in a car? The back seat was full of fast food trash and clothes. He could see the boy huddled in the corner, his hands clenched around a baseball.</p>
<p>Lorne knocked on the window. “Hey, are you okay?”</p>
<p>The boy jammed his cap low on his forehead.</p>
<p>“I bet you need a T-ball uniform.”</p>
<p>The boy nodded wearily, like everybody knew about him and his T-ball needs.</p>
<p>“Okay,” Lorne said, a sense of purpose rising in him. “Okay.”</p>
<p>The exhaust smell still clung to Lorne. That girl, Kimberly, she had been his first funeral. The place was packed. She was twenty-two or twenty-three, a pretty people-pleaser, a good student. The shock of it was an all-systems catastrophe for Lorne. Oatmeal in his veins, pain in his heart. Some people at the funeral had treated Chris like he was to blame and Lorne had stood with his friend like a bodyguard. Chris maybe never got over her death. They were thirty-six and Chris was still unmarried, living three blocks from his parents’ old house. For some reason when Lorne thought of killing himself, he couldn’t fathom his kids or Jenny’s grief, which was like trying to see the curvature of the earth, but thinking about what it would do to Chris gave him a picture and a scenario he could assimilate. His friend would be ruined. Lorne didn’t want to hurt anybody but he wasn’t sure he would be able to help it.</p>
<p>The boy’s mother was at a poker table, standing behind the players, shifting from foot to foot, watching the game. Lorne drew up alongside her and gave her a nudge.</p>
<p>She pulled her gaze from the game and glanced up. Her eyes leapt when she saw him, but she kept her face still. That was hard for most people, poker faces were. Lorne laughed at the idea that he could start playing poker now—his face was stiff all the time anyway. He could rake it in, leave his family with a pile. Parkinson’s for fun and profit.</p>
<p>“Let’s play,” he said. “I’ll stake you. Are you any good?”</p>
<p>“Good enough,” she said.</p>
<p>“How much is that T-ball uniform, anyway?”</p>
<p>“Eighty bucks.”</p>
<p>Lorne whistled. “That’s steep.”</p>
<p>“Cause of the shoes. He needs a glove, too, but that would bring it up to, I don’t know, a hundred and something.”</p>
<p>Lorne considered just giving her the money, sharing a little of his social security windfall. She would take it, he was pretty sure. He thought about taking her up on the sex, but he was afraid. He had already done a couple of things he never thought he’d do, had never wanted to do—the new neighbor down the street and a mother he’d met at Emily’s gymnastics. The meds he was taking were doing something to his impulse control, that was a fact. Dopamine agonists or something like that—they made it impossible to think of consequences. His mind didn’t pull up all the considerations that it used to pull up. Drop that symptom into the disease’s time issues, the new way of living in an eternal present, and you had a problem. He was doing well right then, remembering those early mistakes, remembering the medicine’s side effects, remembering consequences. There were still these moments of clarity. It helped that he wasn’t the slightest bit attracted to her. “So, are you in?” he asked.</p>
<p>“I’m Debbie.” She offered him her hand to shake, and then found an empty spot at the end of the horseshoe-shaped table. He took the seat next to her. Three other players were there, a round Asian woman in a purple velvet track suit, an older dude in a yoked western shirt with pearl buttons who reminded Lorne of Burt Reynolds, and a jug-eared guy still young enough to have acne. They all had the fixed, hard blinking look of people who had been there all night, and the palpable <em>esprit de corps</em> of veterans of a long struggle. The table was low stakes, the kind of table where Lorne used to find his AWOL employees, so he knew how scrappy, how all-or-nothing, these games could be. The all was small, but the nothing was total.</p>
<p>The Asian woman had the biggest pile of chips, guarding it behind wrists wreathed in gold bangles. It looked to Lorne like she should cash out, but she had some higher mark in mind. Lorne bought in for himself and Debbie, twenty bucks each. His hand was crap and he began shaking so badly he could hardly hold it.</p>
<p>Noticing his hands, Debbie leaned across the table. “Hair of the dog’s what you need.” She held up her own steady hands gripping the cards. “Should have seen me this morning—I was worse than you. Why don’t you get a whiskey?”</p>
<p>Lorne smiled at her. So he could pass for an alcoholic.</p>
<p>He folded almost immediately, leaving Debbie at the table looking alert. He wandered the casino, cruising by the poker game every few minutes to check on Debbie’s fortunes. She was cleaning up.</p>
<p>His phone rang. Chris’s ringtone was “Through the Never,” from Metallica’s black album. Whenever Lorne heard it he was sitting on his parents’ couch, listening to that song and playing video games with Chris. Sometimes he felt so sorry for himself he didn’t know what to do, wanted to punish someone, make someone worry. He had lived a charmed life until the diagnosis. Not playing college ball had been his heaviest blow. The troubles of others — his sister’s bipolar disorder, his dad’s PTSD—had made him feel embarrassed for them. He had never for a moment believed they couldn’t snap out of their troubles if they wanted to, and now that he was caught, daily being pulled under in a thousand different ways he couldn’t control, he felt ashamed of his own lack of empathy. And sorry for himself. He couldn’t help it. The phone kept ringing and Lorne picked it up.</p>
<p>“Guess who’s got two tickets to OU/Texas?” Chris said.</p>
<p>“I’m at a casino.”</p>
<p>“Oh no, Lorne, come on. Those places are&#8211;”</p>
<p>“I know.” He stopped and leaned against a slot machine. “But I just found a little boy locked in a car.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Nothing. I’ll leave after a while.”</p>
<p>“You got to get out of yourself, Lorne. Live for something else.”</p>
<p>“Like what?”</p>
<p>“You’ve always said you lived for Sooner Football.”</p>
<p>“Turns out I was exaggerating, friend.”</p>
<p>“Remember old Mr. Foster?”</p>
<p>“Sure.” Mr. Foster was the owner of a pharmacy and a couple of video stores in Lorne and Chris’s hometown of Yukon. In high school, when the two were stars of the high school football team, they been startled to find Mr. Foster and other middle-aged men in town accosting them at gas stations, diners, movie theaters, even dropping by their houses, to give a lot of overly-intense, unwanted advice about how to win games. And if they lost, Lorne and Chris had to virtually go into hiding to avoid the hard scrutiny of these men, who would start out friendly and fatherly before turning mean. “You’re not going to tell me to live for Mr. Foster, are you?”</p>
<p>Chris laughed. “I think maybe the shock, you know, going from being high school heroes to being nobody college students, going from football being our whole lives to knowing we were never going to play another big game, it wouldn’t have been so bad if we hadn’t had those grown men treating us like we held the keys to the kingdom, you know?”</p>
<p>Lorne massaged the bridge of his nose. Since the Parkinson’s diagnosis, Chris had revealed a cheesy, motivational-speaker side to himself that Lorne could hardly bear. “You having a lot of deep thoughts this morning?”</p>
<p>“I wish we’d been good enough for college ball, man, but we weren’t.”</p>
<p>“I’m busy, Chris.”<br />
“Just thinking this disease you got—you’re in another big transition, like with leaving football.”</p>
<p>A few feet away, Lorne could see Debbie push all her chips into the middle, a broad grin on her face, her nose ring sparkling.</p>
<p>“Having Parkinson’s isn’t like football.”</p>
<p>“I’m just saying, I think you’ll get okay with it. You’ll be a different person, kind of.”</p>
<p>“Man, I’m already a different person.” Blood rushed to his face and he banged the back of his head against the slot machine.</p>
<p>He hung up on Chris and banged his head against the slot machine again. Again he dropped the phone. This time it fell on the soft carpet where he scooped it up and walked toward the poker table. The Burt Reynolds look-alike had just won the pot. Debbie watched indignantly as he claimed his chips, twisting the diamond stud in her nose around and around with the tips of her chipped nails. Wild pity rose in Lorne’s throat as he watched her push away from the table and begin roaming over the endless carpet like a sailor in open water. Lorne waved at her.</p>
<p>She smiled and walked over. “So much for T-ball,” she said. “Are you crying?”</p>
<p>“Let’s go back to Plan A,” he said.</p>
<p>She gave him a long look, smoothing down her eyebrows. “Okay.”</p>
<p>~*~</p>
<p>They did it in the women’s restroom, in the roomier stall for handicapped people, a detail that made Lorne think about the letter he’d gotten that morning from social security. “You are entitled to Total disability.” Surely that meant he could use the handicapped stall.<br />
Debbie was dense, harder to hold up than Lorne would have guessed, and he had to push her hard against the wall to keep her in position, pressing her into the heavy plastic multi-roll toilet paper dispenser for ballast. Panting in his face, she had rancid breath, and he found himself turning his head away and thinking about his kids, about how, one by one, they all had arrived at a moment when they developed morning breath. Three, maybe four years old. Before that, they smelled sweet all the time, all of them, that new baby smell, Jenny called it. Jenny herself was pretty great all the time, even when she was sick. She was light—light tempered, light weight, light in all her appetites and her odors. When things got heavy, Jenny stayed light. When Lorne was diagnosed, she said, “At least we know what’s wrong now.” Lorne had been exhibiting symptoms for a few years by then, and Jenny took the diagnosis like a champ, buying Michael J. Fox’s autobiography and quoting it to Lorne all the time. It was very uplifting, that fucking book. Jenny also kept trying to get him to go to group therapy. “There are other people, you know. You could learn from them. How to cope.” But the idea of a room full of hulked and twitching bodies venting the trapped souls inside, no, he wasn’t ready to see in their varying conditions the progression of the disease, wasn’t ready to look at his own future.</p>
<p>He pulled up his pants and leaned against the cold turquoise tiles, panting. Next to him, Debbie buttoned her jeans and pulled the bottom of her T-shirt over her hips. She fluffed her hair.</p>
<p>They had agreed on eighty dollars, but Lorne looked at the clock—it was noon. He thought of that little boy stuck in Debbie’s car all this time and bumped it up to $130, to help with the glove.</p>
<p>“Well, I love you, too,” she said, counting the sum.</p>
<p>“He probably has to pee.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Your little boy out there. You got your money&#8211;you can go home now. Let him out of that car.”</p>
<p>She rocked back on her hips and her posture flared. The fingers hooked around her front belt loops were white with strain, like they might rend her jeans in half. “What are you—you saw him?”</p>
<p>“He’s in first grade, right? Why isn’t he at school?”</p>
<p>She blew out a harsh breath. “To hell with you, you palsied mother fucker! You knew he was out there? You could have just given me the cash.”</p>
<p>She flew from the stall and Lorne heard the rush of the slot machines’ fluctuating electronic tones as she flung open the bathroom door. Someone else walked in when Debbie walked out—he heard the click of heels across the floor and had to wait until the bathroom was empty again before he could leave.</p>
<p>When he got back into the casino, the sordid business in the bathroom fell away. A .38 Special song was playing, which reminded him of his southern-rock loving ex-co-worker, Eugene, who was a loud mouth and had driven Lorne crazy, but whom he now sometimes missed. Lorne thought again about visiting the well site and ordered a burger, fries and a coke to go that he could eat on the drive out of town. He could rarely sense hunger anymore and had dropped a good thirty pounds in the last few months, losing the typical ex-football player’s flab and becoming svelte. He wasn’t hungry now, but he could hear his stomach roaring over the noise of the casino and he felt weak. Debbie was at the poker table again. He saw her smiling, eyes shining, flush with her new money.</p>
<p>A waitress arrived with his order in a plastic bag. He paid her and made for the front doors. Some kind of lunch crowd was filling up the place, the valets were busy at the entrance and he had to weave around a steady throng of working people on his way to the row of cars were Debbie’s old Honda stood. When he found the car, the little boy was asleep.</p>
<p>He knocked on the window.</p>
<p>The boy startled awake.</p>
<p>Lorne held up his bag of food. “Are you hungry?”</p>
<p>The concentrated desire on the boy’s face as he looked at the bag of food reminded Lorne of Debbie at the poker table.</p>
<p>“Roll down the window and I’ll give you this.”</p>
<p>The boy did as he was told, reaching a small hand out for the bag.</p>
<p>“Your mom’s going to be in there awhile,” Lorne said. “Do you need a bathroom?”</p>
<p>“Real bad,” the boy said, jamming his arm into the sack up to his wrist.</p>
<p>“I can take you to a bathroom. You can eat in my car. I’ll bring you right back.”</p>
<p>The boy had a mouthful of fries. He squinted at Lorne.</p>
<p>“My name’s Lorne. What’s your name?”</p>
<p>The boy chewed and swallowed. “Thomas,” he said.</p>
<p>“Hey, Thomas. You can’t go into that casino, but there’s a gas station across the interstate—you need to pee, I can take you there.”</p>
<p>“Can I get a Twix?”</p>
<p>“A Twix. Sure.”</p>
<p>~*~</p>
<p>In jeans that dragged the ground with a good half-foot of extra length, Thomas zipped into and out of the bathroom and then spent several long minutes in the candy aisle, doing what Lorne’s kids always did, picking up one thing, then another, filling his hands, then putting everything down and starting over. With his own kids, Lorne rarely caved in. Jenny didn’t like them eating junk food, so Lorne confined them to the one-candy rule. But Thomas wasn’t his kid, and Thomas looked like he never got what he wanted, so Lorne scooped up everything the boy had picked up and he bought it. Thomas stood behind him in line, jangling with enthusiasm in his baggy jeans.</p>
<p>Back in Lorne’s truck, Thomas set aside the burger he had half eaten and tore into a bag of M &amp; M’s. Lorne swung the truck onto the entrance ramp to the highway. They were directly across the interstate from the casino, but he’d have to drive north a mile or so to exit and turn around. He watched as Thomas tipped the M&amp;M’s bag into his mouth. His phone rang, Jenny’s ring. She had probably gone home for lunch and had seen the social security envelope on the kitchen counter. She could be calling to rhapsodize about what, to her, was good news, or to yell at him for not letting her know, but either way, he didn’t want to talk.</p>
<p>Thomas stopped eating and said, “Your phone’s ringing.”</p>
<p>“That’s okay,” Lorne said.</p>
<p>Thomas studied him. “Why don’t you want to get it?”</p>
<p>“I’m the quiet type,” he said. He had missed the exit and would have to drive to the next one to turn around.</p>
<p>The kid peered out the window. “Aren’t we going back to the casino?”</p>
<p>“I missed my turn.”</p>
<p>Thomas turned and took Lorne in, big-eyed and suddenly tense. “My mom. She’ll be looking for me.”</p>
<p>“I got news for you, Thomas. Your mom’s not leaving that casino anytime soon.”</p>
<p>Thomas continued to stare at Lorne. “I want to go back,” he said under his breath.</p>
<p>“We will. But I was thinking, have you ever seen a pump jack? You know, those things that go up and down and pull oil out of the ground?” Lorne had a vision of Thomas’s home, some filthy one-bedroom apartment he shared with his mother, dirty carpet, bad food, probably a big-ass Rottweiler that crapped all over the place. The kid probably didn’t see much nature, didn’t have a lot of normal kid experiences. “I used to work in the oil fields. I was thinking, you and me could drive out and see my old buddies at one of the well sites. Just a little ways outside of town—fifteen minutes or so. The boys would like you. These pump jacks are real neat, real big machines.”</p>
<p>Thomas had slid himself against the door and had his chin jammed against his chest. He was blinking back tears and muttering.</p>
<p>“Hey, buddy, what’s that?”</p>
<p>But Thomas closed his eyes and clenched his fists, still muttering. Lorne leaned over and made out the words. “Stranger danger, stranger danger, stranger danger.”</p>
<p>Lorne could smell fear sweat pouring off the boy. He didn’t know kids could smell that way and wondered if it was some olfactory hallucination caused by his meds. Lorne studied the boy and understood that Thomas was having a different kind of moment than he was. Thomas’s moment was no good for Thomas. Lorne wasn’t sure how Thomas had gotten scared, but he felt sick himself, dizzy with the disconnect between his world and everybody else’s. Then he imagined one of his kids getting in a truck with a strange guy—why had he not thought of it before? He had been thinking bathroom, thinking candy, thinking special field trip to the well site.</p>
<p>The next exit came fast, and he took it, driving over the interstate to the southbound exit. “Turning around,” he said in a slow, measured voice. “Heading back to the casino, Thomas. Be there in just a minute.”</p>
<p>The boy stayed clenched, but raised his head to look around and verify what Lorne had said. In another couple of minutes, Lorne pulled his truck into the far end of the casino parking lot, several football fields away from the covered parking at the front of the building. Police cars idled before the long bank of front doors, sirens wailing. He was too far away to see what was going on, but he thought he knew. Thomas was sitting up straight now, clutching his bag of candy.</p>
<p>“Hey Thomas? I hate to drop you off this far away from your mom’s car, but—“</p>
<p>“That’s okay.”</p>
<p>Lorne popped the locks and stopped the truck, still deep in the empty part of the parking lot, two football fields to go. Thomas jumped out, giving him a wired, puzzled look as he slid out and slammed the door behind him, pressing the candy bag against his chest. Reaching across the cab, Lorne grabbed the door and pulled it shut. Thomas’s wispy form sped down the length of the parking lot, baggy jeans dragging the concrete, his OU hat jammed low on his head. He began weaving in and out among the cars, looking for his mother’s, until the dark shapes of police officers converged on him. Lorne turned the truck around and headed home. They were talking about the big game with Texas that weekend, but Lorne couldn’t concentrate. As he drove north through the metro, he shook so badly it was hard to steer, and for once he didn’t think it was the disease that caused the shaking.</p>
<p>When he got home, he saw the social security letter on the kitchen counter and Cade’s note reminding him to blow up the Halloween cat still propped up by the salt shaker awaiting his attention. In an hour, his kids would be home from school, Jenny a little while later. Cade’s slumber party would start, he thought, at 5:00. Lorne yanked the creaking plastic mass from a big box in the garage, which still reeked of exhaust, and situated it on the front lawn so that when it was blown up it would look like it was guarding the sidewalk leading to the front door. That was where they always put it. He pumped it up as full as it could go without bursting. It stood four feet high and twice as long, shiny and stiff, a big black cat with white fangs and glowing yellow eyes.</p>
<p>But then a low hiss started and the cat began to rock gently, to soften; its taut, round shape loosening like Jenny’s abdomen after giving birth. He walked around the creature with his palms out, an inch or two away from the shiny surface. His hands shook and he fought the need to let them curl. Finally he felt it, the soft rush of air against his palm, and he stuck his finger over the hole. From his jacket pocket he pulled a role of black tape and tore a piece off with his teeth and smoothed it over the hole. The hissing stopped. He returned to the pump and refilled the cat with air until its yellow eyes bulged, its white fangs hung like icicles and its ears stood stiff to their points, like they could hear everything, the past and the future, the things that weren’t true and the things that were.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wanted him, but I wanted to be sure. I don’t inspire chivalry. I take after my mother in that I am five two and have the appendages of a WWE wrestler. My mother is one of those women who studies Marx and identifies herself readily as a peasant, but she is not. She is insistent that I be proud of my Italian heritage and my sturdy body, as though our Italian ancestors were not slaveholders in North Carolina, but broad shouldered immigrants with fistfuls of potatoes and dirt. But I have nice olive skin and I can shoot a gun with precision — akin to the exacting tilt of the Earth’s axis, the temperature of the atmosphere, the gull with a beak full of ham sandwich, plastic baggie and all.</p>
<p>I wanted him sentimentally, so I avoided him. I wanted him because he spoke in monologues. I wanted him because when he wasn’t speaking he looked like he was listening. His body was pure blackness, pure dark in which to be surrounded symphonically and dramatically. He had physical tics.</p>
<p>I prodded the body with my foot. Dallas was not comfortable in August. I was surrounded by humidity, by concrete reflecting back heat, even more so it seemed, because the sky was tented with dark clouds. Around me was yellow tape strung from a bench to the pond’s edge, was a chalk outline around the body, was men smoking and making muffled jokes. Touching the body was not strictly procedural, but I wanted to see the underside of the tattoo on the body’s hip. She was a young girl with a sunburnt face, blond until the roots which were dark and greasy. She was a girl or had been. Her tattoo depicted a swan twined by ivy, the feathers emphasized and crosshatched on her skin, and the photo guy, Stern, kept shaking. It was his first day in the field; he was only in his late twenties. He wore black, and he was skittish and tall with a hook nose; he looked Swedish; he looked like he’d been a jock who discovered opium or something else to smoke that ate away at his muscles and left him a string of bones. He was not popular among the men.</p>
<p>Earlier, on our way to the Fairgrounds, Sterne told me that he had wanted to be a fashion photographer. He had pictured himself brushing sand from his camera on a New Zealand beach.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. I saw, in Stern’s washed out face, and in his confession of mixed up dreams (for he would be taking pictures of women, he would find many women, yes he would) a possibility for my own confession of love. Not for him, no, but for Roger who sat next to me in my AA meetings. Roger with his sneakers scuzzy, his wayward ginger beard, his freckled knuckles whitening as we held hands. When we held hands for the opening prayer, his palms turned pink and sweated. He would release my hand at times, and wipe his on the leg of his cowboy jeans. He often had paint on his jeans, colorful patches and streaks rioting artistically. His tight pants revealed him as no longer thin, no longer young, still the remnants were there and I could excavate them, yet his eyes, boyish, seemed to do that as well.</p>
<p>“I just thought. I used to take pictures of my girlfriend. Do you want to see them? I just thought I’d be making art.” Stern said.</p>
<p>“No,” I said. A confused rain fell, so soft and silent, as if it did not quite want to be raining.</p>
<p>The shadows stretched over the city, the city scuttling underneath like grey insects. I did not think I would last much longer as a criminal investigator. The city had worn into me. The city was rabid, ugly, and the people looked like grotesque invertebrates in paper skin. Stern looked out the window as he drove and almost rear-ended a car. My coffee spilled on my thigh and burnt me, and I looked at my reflection in the side mirror. I looked at my reflection to see it how Roger would, and I sighed, my makeup had pancaked and flattened in the humidity. And Stern ate. He ate and ate this breakfast sandwich&#8211; crumbs freckling his mouth and chest. He was thin as a rail and had long fingernails. He stopped talking.</p>
<p>I prodded the body with my foot. I saw the grey and white and red and pink of the tattoo. The swan had a pink heart shaped tongue inside its red mouth. I thought, looking at that, that she must have been the kind of girl who wrote cryptic text messages of abbreviations. She must have been the kind of girl who woke up hung-over and sore from some blurry sex on Sundays. The rain fell embracing, covering her body. She was lying on the dirt path, alongside the water, the path that snaked its way behind the Natural History Museum and the Butterfly Exhibit. The buildings were brick and like squat skyscrapers, as if they had decided halfway up that they didn’t need to reach the sky. There were ducks on the water, green necked mallards, and the path, yellow like the buildings, mushed some with the rain. She must have been seventeen. I thought it was strange how her fingers curled. Somebody had bludgeoned her to death. You could see she was wealthy&#8211; her purse no knock off and her short tennis skirt pleated with quality. Then why was her hair so greasy?</p>
<p>I brushed her hair from her eyes. This was not strictly procedural. I inhaled the scent of gardenia and sweat and death. Her eyes were open and blue in an offensive way against her thick mascara. Her eyes were petrified, hard and scared, as if she had seen the Gorgon head. The glue from her false eyelashes was melting a little and one fell over her left eye as if she were winking. She was exposed, her body closed but it was as if we had found her naked, and we were outside of the Butterfly Exhibit. I pictured the monarchs primarily. I could see their thin black and orange wings flying in the humid air among the imported plants, and I wondered that although you couldn’t feed them, they landed on you sometimes. Her lips were slightly parted and she wore socks with her sandals. I found that strange, that in the heat of August she had put on socks, not to mention it wasn’t how girls like her dressed. I wondered&#8211; could it be that she was walking a great distance? Could she be a runaway?</p>
<p>“Who is she? Has she been identified?”</p>
<p>“She may be the daughter of the Clarks. We didn’t find identification. But the Clarks reported their daughter missing yesterday.”</p>
<p>“What’s her name?”</p>
<p>“We don’t know.”</p>
<p>“What’s the daughter’s name, I mean?”</p>
<p>“Annabel.”</p>
<p>I took a few notes. Just scribbled some things that I hoped I could make out later. I saw that she had probably not been sexually assaulted. She had not been robbed. She had just been murdered. Her thin torso, string bean arms, lay bent over her thick tan thighs, the rain and the heat frizzing her hair.</p>
<p>I told them to put a tarp up and left. I rode the DART train back to my house. I watched all the green skyscrapers reflecting all the shiny grey people. I saw it all through the windows of the train and my own reflection in the windows of the train, and the reflections of the people in the buildings were warped by the glass, far outnumbering the ornamental trees growing at even intervals. I thought this case would be one of those things shut away. She had run away and had only prepared herself for running away by wearing socks. The Clarks were a wealthy family though, and they would want an answer.</p>
<p>I got home and put the teakettle under the faucet, then put it on the stove. I was on vacation, but they had called me in this morning because my partner Underwood had called in again, so I said I would work a few hours. I had taken vacation in order to paint. I was working on self-portraits. I was trying to make references to Frida Kahlo. I knew this was redundant. I was not making anything new. I knew Frida Kahlo hated America, but I could not help myself. I was trying to paint allegorically, like her, but all I ever saw was confusion, as if everything spilled out of me jumbled. I painted blood percolating from my nose and running through the matted ends of my curls. I painted in my bedroom with the ceiling fan on. I had a wet-looking green comforter that made me seasick, but when I bought it I liked its shine. I lay on my covers at night, naked, watching the shadows cast by the fan and rubbing ice on my body.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I made my bed and put my easel to the side of the mirror above my dresser, where I had a view of myself and of my bed, and I would just see the dead faces of the dead bodies so numbly communicative&#8211; bodies that I saw every day&#8211; they would crowd my mirror. And every symbol stands for something else, as if it is dead, as if it doesn’t have its own voice.</p>
<p>Sometimes my partner Underwood went to AA meetings with me, and sometimes he called me at night and asked me on a date and asked me to talk him out of it, he didn’t want to drink, and I could hear the sound of the TV in the background, and he would call out “Just a minute!” to his wife. Underwood was only a few inches taller than me and looked like a Cherub with a buzz cut. And he had innocent blond hair and innocent blue eyes—he looked perpetually satisfied with himself. Because of Underwood, it seemed, I never got a vacation.</p>
<p>I slept with him a few times out of boredom. We always went to the basement of his two story house in the suburbs. The house was pretty but looked fake somehow, as if somebody had stapled it up for a theater production. It suited Underwood. The basement did too with its plasma TV and a stuffed white couch. He spread some kind of plastic tarp on the couch and then pulled me down and we tangled for a while. We didn’t know why we were doing it, or at least I didn’t, but work was slow for a few days and we went to Quiktrip to get coffee and then I was above him, the plastic thwacking and sticky against my knees and shins. I got into a rhythm, closed my eyes and saw Roger, approached ecstasy, pausing to linger on it, to kiss Underwood. I leaned over him sweating, and put my tongue in his mouth, but his tongue was like a pebble, smooth, not urgent, so I finished him off mechanically. I lay on him afterwards, and we watched episodes of The Office. We talked about our bosses: Sarge was egotistical and the chief was a sadist pacifist and Underwood kissed me on the forehead.</p>
<p>“God,” he said, as if filled with regret.</p>
<p>Then we got dressed and did it again the next day, and then the next. The third day he wrestled with himself, I could tell because he kept throwing a grey tennis ball in the air, it must have been the dog’s, and finally threw it at the wall. And so I said, “Underwood, this is just too much,” and it felt as if the line had been stapled onto me by some thespian.</p>
<p>“God.” He rolled me off of him abruptly. “I am so glad you said that.”</p>
<p>Later that night the coroner’s report was e-mailed to me. It stated that Annabel had suffered a fatal blow to the head. It did not mention how the wound, bleeding, spread from the back of her skull to the nape of her neck. The blood spilled to the yellow gravel, and tapered off like a question. It did not mention the sharp blue of the sky until the clouds gathered and wetted the blood and mingled the blood with water. I saw her lying prone, hands clenched and close, as if in prayer. And we gathered around her and I touched her gingerly with my foot.</p>
<p>I have a nice house on the M streets (Marigold, Marquita), a quiet kind of neighborhood of green grass and Japanese elms&#8211; I rent though, really I don’t have a house, I just rent. It’s small and white. I have put down woven rugs and wicker furniture because I like the summer and because summer is so long in Dallas. In my kitchen, Spanish tiles and a silver sink, I made my tea, and I kept thinking about the girl. Her naked eyes, and then I began to think about other eyes, Roger’s eyes, and I poured the tea down the sink and the eyes ran together liquid; it was just the rain that made me want the tea, but it was too hot, and I got a cup of ice water and sat out on the front porch. I had an old black rocking chair out there that was my grandmothers, and I wondered at this union of life around me. The pecan tree for the squirrels and sparrows and the grass with root systems holding together the soil and the pigeons were for nothing, they were useless, and the rocking chair squeaked. As I fell asleep I wondered why I could not remember if he was married or not, the man I wanted, almost desperately, almost purely but stained with biology, or perhaps purified by biology, and I woke up in the evening when the June bugs came out, and I picked them off of my skin and noticed a crick in my neck. I had missed the AA meeting.</p>
<p>I went back to work the next Monday with my paintings stored in the attic&#8211; utter failures. I rode the bus to work. I work downtown. I had thought very little. I had been in the painting space—that horizon where language bleeds to vision and the connections you make are made by instinct&#8211; but I was pulled out of it abruptly upon entering the office. The place was open like a cafeteria, mostly men. There were long tin desks crowded with laptops and telephones. The walls were blue and tacked with pencil portraits finer than mine. The men posed burly, they were all trying to be bigger than themselves, and sometimes I took up this body language myself. Monday morning I walked in with paint flecked fingernails and saw the men gathered around something. They appeared as mourners: contemplative, sorrowful, fascinated. I walked over to them.</p>
<p>The men stood aside as I walked over and quickly resumed their postures at their desks: this man leaning back in his chair, another man twirling his I-phone in absent boredom. Stern, I saw, was at the center of this gathering and he had photographs spread across his desk. I saw their gloss as I put my briefcase down. I took out my notes. Last week I wrote: swan tattoo, vines, socks, fatal blow. Stern motioned me over, and I was reluctant for some reason. Something about the way the men stood about solemnly, with their heads bowed and yet angling up in fits and starts, as if both hoping for a better view and for an escape at the same time, made me feel anxious. Stern motioned again. I walked to him.</p>
<p>He got up. Stood back. He asked “What do you think?”</p>
<p>I saw that Annabel was rendered there, her lifeless body. I saw the curve of her torso, her nose ring winking in a glint somehow, although it was a rainy day. Her fine features—her thin mouth and her big blue eyes, her nose Grecian, with a slight dent, a slight flaw. That was the thing. She looked beautiful. Her eyes were naked like I saw them, but somehow not shocked, no outrage paralyzing them. I involuntarily traced her chin, her face oval, her slightly pointed chin. Her legs together, slack becomes smooth.</p>
<p>“What do you think?” He asked again. I detected in his voice some pride and it was all I could do not to let out a wail. I did not think she could be brought back to life, and I only felt strangled in the confusion of these eloquent pictures and the abruptness of her eyes in my memory. I stood there, quiet for a moment.</p>
<p>“You didn’t get a shot of the injury.”</p>
<p>“I did. I have some. This is just, you know, this is just the beginning.”</p>
<p>I went back to my desk and finished unpacking my brief case. There was another case—the case of a homeless man gutted in a crack house—and there were things I had to do. I walked past the men, who were unusually quiet, and I couldn’t read their faces, but I thought they read mine, and I got a cup of coffee from the lounge. The lounge was a garishly lighted closet with a bulletin board detailing the advantages of hygiene and the mortality rates of the city. Underwood was in there.</p>
<p>I looked and I saw he had his thermos—a sure sign that he was drinking, slipping whiskey in his coffee. “She was a looker,” he said and whistled. “She was a real looker and I don’t think it was right.”</p>
<p>I was shaking but I didn’t know why. “She was young.”</p>
<p>“She has that look. You know you think all these years that it wouldn’t get to you and then all of a sudden some kind of, even when she was dead…”</p>
<p>“Underwood.”</p>
<p>“Yes?” He looked around furtively, took a slug off his thermos.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to be beautiful to make it a sorry world.”</p>
<p>I thought he mumbled something, maybe jealous underneath his breath, and I left and walked back to my desk. I was unsettled. I was thinking in my mind her name was Annabel and it was all I could do to get those bastards to acknowledge it.</p>
<p>I went to AA that Thursday. I practiced things I would say to him. I practiced jokes, and joking innuendoes, and ways to unveil the nature of his relationship with his mother, and if he was sleeping with any women, and I practiced invitations to coffee and other, more open, invitations. He sat on the opposite side of the room. He said, “Hello, my name is Roger, and I’m an alcoholic.” I clapped fervently. He took his sneakers and tucked them under his chair, and brought them forward, and stretched them out, and bounced his leg up and down and couldn’t get out of there fast enough. I thought he must have a girlfriend. I looked at how my hair grew so curly and I looked at the cracked cuticles at the base of my nails and I thought of the pictures of Annabel. I thought of her blue eyes beseeching the world.</p>
<p>The coroner’s report states that the body is Caucasian, the body was in good health, blue eyes, blond hair, 5”8. It does not tell the poetry this suggests. It does not speak of grass stained soccer shorts, notes passed scented vanilla, lip gloss scented raspberry, climbing trees in a white Easter dress and later kisses that taste of Homecoming games and Halloween candy.</p>
<p>This is how I tell it. The first time I got drunk I was fifteen. Tommy Redders put his dry pitcher’s hand up my skirt. We were out in his back yard and the grass was straw; we were out by his dad’s tool shed chipped paint and turpentine smelling. He said he’d take me to prom, and I couldn’t believe I was back there with Tommy&#8211; all eyelashes and swagger. The boys were incidents, were repetitions of movement, swells and recesses that washed over me. I never went to prom. I slipped down, sloshed a sloppy river, my life, since fifteen. Careful. Measuring out the booze through the day in cups and in ounces, so that I didn’t run sloppy until Friday, or Saturday, or Sunday. What I liked about it was his hand up my skirt. What I liked about it was being spun around the Milky Way and landing dead in the center of the universe. I could be myself because I wasn’t myself.</p>
<p>On Friday the Clarks called me. They were very polite and insistent. The body had been identified. It was their daughter. They were grieving, and although not yet hysterical, they were near-hysterical. I tried to tell them there weren’t any leads so far, that we didn’t know. We simply didn’t know how their child had been lost&#8211; for a thrill for a young girl just to die for a thrill. They would not listen, their expensive tears sharpened on ideas of retribution, finding peace&#8211; some kind of hybrid of the two. I went to talk to them.</p>
<p>I went on the bus. My license had been unofficially revoked. I looked forward as I rode; I could only see the traffic swirling around me, stopping me here and spitting me out there. They lived in Highland Park—a neighborhood so exclusive it was actually legally a separate city although well within Dallas city limits. The houses were intimidating not only for their size but for their details. They were large and square and shuttered, to take tea in, brick or wooden, with carefully planted verdency. The Clarks lived in one of the few Spanish style houses, one wing flowing to the next architecturally. The biggest magnolia tree I had ever seen stood waxy in the front yard, and high thorny buck rose bushes guarded the door. As I walked to it, black with a brass knocker, I felt a kind of sorrow that seemed unfamiliar. It seemed to be related to the fact that Roger had not sat next to me last night, and seemed to be related to Annabel’s nose ring piercing the rain.</p>
<p>We talked for two hours. Mrs. Clark was rather short and thin and tan, almost beautiful but with a kind of too-long horse face. She looked blind, until she started talking about Annabel, and then her eyes kindled wetly, sputtering. Mr. Clark was tall and thin. He had her nose. He had short neat hair, and had a kind of twangy grace to his movements, as if his body were an instrument. Sudden chords of a steel guitar. It was strange to see him. I thought Annabel took after him.</p>
<p>We sat in the large living room with the French doors closed to the backyard. I sat on a stiff couch upholstered in coral silk. They had many things to say about her. I asked them who she knew. I asked them if she had any addictions. I asked them where she liked to hang out. I took notes. The light changed, went from direct to diffusive; the room absorbed it and had its own light; the shadows went from pointed to shapeless. I tried to ask them why she may have run away, but, and this was not strictly procedural, I did not. The room was very formal, and between us was a coffee table spread with photos and National Geographic, and they sat facing me on a yellow love seat framed in wood. Strange, though, there was a cheap plastic fan in front of the fire place, and the spider plants bent and danced as it blew warm air on us.</p>
<p>They told me she was a sprinter and that she loved the Beatles, and that she had this laugh. They said she had this kind of laugh that she belted out and she was very musical, a clarinet player in the band, and when she laughed it had this kind of boisterous quality. She was very athletic too. She was just like this tornado of talents. &#8220;Tornado of talents&#8221;&#8211; it seemed to be a phrase they had invented and repeated. Did she have a boyfriend? Was he violent? She was just, they said, a firecracker. A tornado. After an hour they turned to the photos on the coffee table. I saw they were of Annabel. She was pretty for sure. She was in a track suit here, she was dressed for prom in a pink dress trailing and the corsage as big as her hair. She didn’t look the same though; she didn’t look the same as those pictures Stern took of her.</p>
<p>I returned home, looking past the scenes presenting themselves. A mother with a bag of groceries and two kids on leashes, a business man laughing loudly with his hands gesturing, as if to no one, the stray homeless wretched without cigarettes, bumming smokes and nickels. I got to my house, unlocked the door. I expected somebody to be there.</p>
<p>I tried to sleep. The universe was all around me, but there was no weight to it, no pinpoint it spun around.</p>
<p>I couldn’t sleep, so I set a sketchbook up by my mirror, and drew by the faint electric street light. I used black, I just used black. I let the shadows of my face define the image. I went back to sleep. When I woke up the next morning I saw that I had sketched Annabel. It was the best sketch I had ever done, I thought. Her eyes had that dream quality, like in the photographs. Her eyes looked like lovers whispering, or a hard green bud.</p>
<p>Saturday I went back to the office. I knew we would have to arrest somebody. I said to Underwood, who was always there when he was not on a bend, “Did you get those prints? What were the most recent?”</p>
<p>He had the records of the finger prints we took off of a green metal bench that was to the right of Annabel’s body. “There was some woman’s. I think her name was Ginny. She’s some meth addict in and out of half-way houses.”</p>
<p>“What was she doing there?”</p>
<p>He shrugged.</p>
<p>“Near the Butterfly Exhibit? Was she going to smoke the butterflies?”</p>
<p>“She was there.”</p>
<p>“Bring her in. Get a confession.”</p>
<p>Underwood’s mom had dragged them in and out of grandma’s house and shelters, and he was reluctant to assume anything. He was reluctant to base anything on what was not at least eighty five percent factual evidence. When I told him to bring her in he raised his innocent eyebrows at me.</p>
<p>“Just do it.” I began packing my things. I noticed a stack of photographs on Stern’s desk. Underwood was drinking out of his coffee mug, looking maudlin, so I thought I should get home. I just needed. I just wanted.</p>
<p>I went over to Stern’s desk and took the photographs and slipped them into my briefcase. This was not strictly procedural. I thought I wanted a drink. I thought of fucking Underwood who was married and lectured me too much. But I remembered his perfect cock, nested in his blond pubic hair—a pinkish oblong stone&#8211; still I disliked the slick quality of his skin, as if he rubbed lotion on himself. I thought those shots of vodka or fucking Underwood again amounted to the same thing, so I would simply go home and have a cup of tea. I thought about drinking. I thought about last fall. When I lost my license.</p>
<p>I had slammed my car head on with another driver. I had climbed out of my Volkswagen. It had been upturned. I climbed out of it to find some skeletal old man standing in front of the fiery guts of a baby-blue pick-up, wearing a singed blue bandana around his pointy head, screaming in my face. Half his face was a pink salmon wound bleeding in between fissures, he had been burned, it spread out like a painful map across his face and he was pointing a finger at me as if I were on the map too, as if he had spotted hell right there in my face. The finger was spindly and blistered.</p>
<p>I called Underwood crying, who called the chief. The chief came out there himself, out to the abandoned road. He didn’t put his lights on. The department had been rocked by drug scandal, officers skimming off the top, officers dealing, and he couldn’t afford another blemish on his record. He told me to go to AA; he told me if he caught me drinking, and he would be watching, I was gone. Out. He told me not to drive until I’d been off booze a year. This was easy. This was a slap on the wrist. This was to be kept quiet. No drinking. I imagined, standing there in the night, that I saw blue and red lights flashing on his cheeks. He took the man I hit to the hospital.</p>
<p>When I got home from the office I got my pastels from under the sink and with a loneliness that almost made me buckle, I colored in Annabel’s face until any traces of my own face were erased.</p>
<p>I was restless. I had ruined the sketch. It was a cartoon now. I tried sitting on the porch. I sat on the edge of the rocking chair and absently swayed back and forth. The silence of my house was sometimes soothing, sometimes suffocating. The June bugs attacked me with clingy legs and I went inside. The house made sounds: creaks and pops, and I lay on my bed. I fell asleep in my clothes and woke up at three in the morning. I heard a slamming noise and the wind knocked at the windows. I went into the living room, towards the sound, and discovered that my screen door had not been properly shut. It was banging in the wind as if it was alive.</p>
<p>The way I had felt, lying in my bed, listening to it rapping, made me think of death. And this made me, after I had latched the door&#8211; secured it&#8211; open my briefcase and take out the pictures.</p>
<p>There was Annabel. She was captured in a kind of soft focus&#8211; so beautiful. Why had Roger sat across the room from me, Annabel? Why had he left so quickly? Her hair, which had been greasy, was shiny in the pictures, was resplendent. Her dead eyes seemed curious. She draped across the ground, undefined by the chalk, defying it. She flowed from her toes to her tennis skirt to her neon pink tank top to her shoulders to her dark roots. I sat on my wicker couch and turned on a lamp. Annabel the belle of the ball. Annabel oh how you make men crawl. The injustice of this gorgeousness was like a prism, fracturing and naming the light, dividing it, spreading it out in random directions. She was dead. These were pictures of her body. But.</p>
<p>It cost a little money. But you would notice: I’m not eating alone tonight. I have cooked a meal&#8211; cheesy grits and fried chicken. There is a fruit salad too and tea candles flicker. We are drinking sparkling grape juice. Roger is in my home. Roger is looking sideways at himself in the mirror above the table, smoothing his disobedient hair. He is laughing and telling me anecdotes. He tells me about the road trip he took with his buddies. Their car broke down and they hitchhiked to Albuquerque only to run out of money so they went gambling with five dollars and lost fifteen hundred so Roger’s mom had to pick them up and pay their debt. He was thirty-three. He tells me about pissing his pants and falling on the richest widow in Dallas in Bijoux, and how he tumbled down on her with a brown curtain, tumbling carrying the brown curtain and brown chair and her with him. He tells me she had astonishing white hair. It was permed and almost snow, but for the lavender tint. It turns out he is funny.</p>
<p>We fall into silences sometimes, but we have the same scarred history of alcohol abuse, so we know these silences. We trade war stories. We rue the day. We wish our grape juice was wine. The table is too long, I want to put my hand on that thick thigh. We watch each other eat, gleaning personality from patterns of consumption. I wrack my brain for questions, to keep him going, to keep him talking, but it is unnecessary. He is wound up. He seems to want me to know every part of him, and that is what I want. I want to observe him. I want to know him. I want to know who he was in the trenches and who he is now in the painful aftermath of sobriety.</p>
<p>It cost a little money. I dyed my hair blond, leaving the roots. I went to a high end hair dresser. I told her to straighten it and make it shiny. When she was done my hair like a puddle of oil; it was smooth and reflective. Then I went to East Dallas to get my nose pierced and a tattoo of a swan with vines twining it. I put the tattoo just above my hip, and it covered just the tip of my front waist. That was about two thousand, all of that. I got the blue contacts, but I didn’t need the tanning salon. I brushed my cheeks with blush like I had been in the sun. I hung the pictures up on my wall and studied them. I told Stern I was looking for clues, and I was. I walked how it looked like she would walk, and I talked how it looked like she would talk. I lost weight. The guys at work didn’t quite put it together, they looked at me funny and they thought something, but they couldn’t quite place it. They asked for my number. I put together clothing that I had seen in the photographs her family had shown me. I listened to my sprinklers at night, like the rain, and I slept with my torso at an angle over my body and I sat right next to Roger in AA and I asked him to coffee and he turned as red as a beet and agreed.</p>
<p>And he is here, and he is talking. And I am afraid to speak; I am afraid that if I open my mouth Annabel will be shattered, will be sent back to Hades with all her secrets, and I wrap my fingers, twine them, around the wine glass which holds grape juice, and I laugh like I am improvising a song, like I am playing the clarinet for a room full of people, and they are silent, hanging on each note.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Come pale morning the old woman found a greycoat squirrel drifting dead in the swimming pool waters. It travelled slow to the south-end, trawling leaves and surface algae. Pegged there its wasted tail stropped the lip-molding. Emily Moore stood outside the short-fence with her roughskinned palms resting atop the arrowhead pickets. Beyond the pool and the little farmhouse were acres of untended field. Wildgrass and rogue wheats the color of desert sand. A tractor half-sunk into black, black soil. Two silos ringed with rusted boltwork, old lettering worn faint and unreadable.</p>
<p>“Bob,” she said loud. “We got another in the pool.”</p>
<p>Nobody answered so she turned and made for the sliding doors to the kitchen, open yet with the drawn curtains rolling against the wind. He came out before she got there.</p>
<p>“Yes, dear. You called.”</p>
<p>“Oh shh,” she said. “Get that net and your shovel.”</p>
<p>The old man stood a head taller than her, broad shouldered and bowlegged, heavy plaids and worn-out jeans.</p>
<p>“How big a hole we gonna need? My back ain’t my best friend today.”</p>
<p>“Ah,” she said. Looked over to the pool. “Maybe three scoops. No more’n four. The poor little fella saw less winters than he should have.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>They interred the squirrel in the damp, dark soil. Tucked him in with the flat of the shovelhead and pinned a treebranch cross there at the head of his small plot. That potter’s ground had dozens more crosses set in awkward rows, very few lost to wear and weather. Emily had written on all of them in black ink, such things as: ‘Raccoon. Spring. 1998.’ Markers had likewise been posted for chipmunks, groundhogs, rabbits, one wayward cat. The old man had complained early on about the burials but it turned out that if they didn’t lay out the bodies his wife couldn’t sleep at night. So he’d quit his griping and kept at the planting. No prayers were said.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Emily walked the grounds maybe a mile out from the house, following the length of a long and bending stream. There were blockages where water built and ran humped over sodden leaves. The old woman carried a cherry-branch walking stick and she worked the little dams loose and watched the current take them on bit by bit. An hour past and she could see rainclouds and their vaporous tailings. Steadily they went with the rains below like shuffling fibers. Her knees were singing to her about the humidity. She’d had to retie her long, gray hair more than once on the walk and now she just let it blow about the shoulders of her overcoat.</p>
<p>“Jeez, it’s close,” she said.</p>
<p>On the way back the day turned eerie and very dim. A sparrow flock boomed from a huge and naked oak out in the fields, wound themselves inside out and took off to the north. Emily left the creekline and headed across the fields toward the farmhouse. She had very good eyes and she could see Bob out in the backlot, like a toy figure stood there. He raised one hand and pointed at the skies that shifted behind her. Emily didn’t look.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Winds whipped the little house while they lay in their places in bed. They’d left the window slit-open and it whistled at them. The drapes were near sideways for minutes at a time. Emily’s bedside lamp had its bulb turned low and she had laid her book down beside it a long time ago to study the sounds of that storm. Thunderclaps landed like atomics and could be felt by the bedsprings. She had thought the weathers would carry past but it all seemed to have sat down and settled right in that farmstead. Finally she reached up into the lamp and turned the key. The room didn’t go truly dark somehow. Once in a while fork-lightning flashed white daylight through the curtaincloth, scented the air with electric.</p>
<p>“This is a bad one, ain’t it?” Bob said.</p>
<p>“Yes. I don’t remember the last like it.”</p>
<p>He had corralled her in against him and she let him. His arms with their cord-muscle and mean elbowknobs, skin soft as old paper. She closed her eyes and then opened them again.</p>
<p>“Jesus H. Christ,” she said. “What the hell is that?”</p>
<p>“I took one a’ them pills,” he said.</p>
<p>“When?”</p>
<p>“Few hours ago.”</p>
<p>Emily whacked him on the thigh through the covers. The two of them lay there quiet for a while with the rains battering the roofshingles.</p>
<p>“Well…” she said, and turned around, took his face in her hands.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The kitchen entranceway fairly shone near sunrise. Emily had the door open and the floortiles were warming under her bare feet. The storm had picked up debris from across the county and seemed to have flung the all of it down on their plot. Emily waited for Bob to dress while she brewed coffee on the stove. She thought the power would be out for sure but it wasn’t or at least wasn’t anymore.</p>
<p>They went outside in their coveralls and boots and Bob made for the garage and his barrow and work-tools. A length of eavestrough had come loose at one end of the building and he had to shift it wide to get the door open. Emily watched him fuss with the thing for a few seconds and then she walked out from the house. She’d not made it to the poolside fencing and yet she knew something was wrong in there. The waters were dark with steeped mud, and thatchwork layers of leaves and sticks lay over entire sections of the pool. Near the centre a young woman’s white body carried past in a torn nightgown, lower back and ass up at the surface while her arms and legs and hair dangled like she was reaching for something at the bottom.</p>
<p>Emily didn’t know how she got over the fence but she was over and bonesore in her legs. She called back toward the house. Her hand searched the water for part of the girl’s gown but it couldn’t reach. When she got into the pool the cold all but stopped her heart.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The body lay under a sheet on the stonework behind the house for the better part of the morning. The police had come by the dozen and they’d studied the pool and the girl and they’d surveyed the farmgrounds that sucked the boots right off their feet. A towering, ginger haired cop called McGuire spoke to Emily and Bob at their kitchen table, his hat over his kneejoint. He asked them a few questions and none too hard. Emily sat swaddled in so many blankets that she could barely stand when the cop got up and put his hat back on. McGuire smiled and she shook his huge hand before the cop left out to get his instructions from the newly landed detectives.</p>
<p>By evening they were very much alone. Bob had gone back outside and tried to work against the creeping dark, stacking the loose breakwood into a teepee as tall as he was, great mound of leaves and long-grass underneath. While he worked by twilight Emily ran a bath, sat there on the closed-over toilet watching the tub fill up. She had a bottle of beer in her hand and there were two empties on the bathroom countertop beside her. She drank the last of the one she had and took the bottles out to the kitchen. Came back with another beer and again sat there waiting. When the tubwater started gurgling down the overflow she went over and turned the taps. Emily started to take her robe off and then stopped. She stared down into the tub for a minute. Then she reached in and yanked the plug.</p>
<p>When she came back outside Bob had already lit the stack. It smoldered low at the heart, the pilings too dense and too damp yet. Emily shut the sliding door and walked over to him with two beers in hand, offered him the one. Bob looked her up and down.</p>
<p>“You okay?” he said.</p>
<p>“Okay as I’ll get today,” she said.</p>
<p>He put his left arm around her like they were gone to the drive-in. Smoke started railing out from somewhere in the build and carried up into the dusk. Flash of yellow. Nothing. Leaves started curling.</p>
<p>“Here ‘tis,” she said.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Over the mottled fields she went. Half an hour out she got to the treeline and scoped the firs. The sun hung high and furious but the inner woods were lit only in patches. Emily walked on over the forest floor and its pine-needle carpeting. She had the cherry-stick and used it to shift face-height branches, cobwebs thick as string that broke and trailed ghostly from their peggings. Eventually she reached a break in the trees, a shieldrock ridge that looked out over a low clearing. A narrow clay path led down to the place in a series of switchbacks. Emily didn’t go any further.</p>
<p>A cabin sat crooked on the grounds below, no more than three rooms. Satellite outhouse with a shovel-dug shithole. The place had foundered a little on the southwest end but the windows and doors were intact and the frames square. Nothing stirred. Still, Emily waited there for the better part of an hour before she started down the grade.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>She made it back to their fields in time to see her husband on the drive back from town. His truck rolled tiny in the distance, spitting dust on the concession road before it turned off for their long laneway. Bob parked and went into the house and came out again, looked around. Went back inside.</p>
<p>He was in the john when she came through and hung up her coat. She waited for him in the kitchen but she didn’t sit, just leaned her hip to the sink-counter. He pissed loud and quieter and louder yet, sound plain as could be with the door wide open. Little one-shots afterward that rung the bowl. Out he came cinching his belt on the walk. When he saw her standing there he stopped for a second and coughed. Kept on with the buckle before stuffing in his shirt-tails.</p>
<p>“You know nobody can sneak up on me,” he said.</p>
<p>She blew air hard over her lips.</p>
<p>Bob went over to the counter, brushed his shoulder against hers as he passed. He started up the stove-burner and left the coffeepot to brew atop it.</p>
<p>“Did you go by the cop shop?” she said.</p>
<p>“I did.”</p>
<p>“They find her people.”</p>
<p>“There ain’t any people.”</p>
<p>Emily shook her head.</p>
<p>“I don’t think I can believe that. Even if it is true.”</p>
<p>Bob nodded. He set a cup down for her and then poured another. When he sat at the table he didn’t drink and he didn’t talk.</p>
<p>“What else?” Emily said.</p>
<p>“They said the girl had a blood-alcohol level that coulda sat a buffalo down. As well as her veins were run through with Benzodiazepine.”</p>
<p>Emily put her hand to her mouth for a minute and let it drop. She stared out the windowglass at the muckfields. Bob turned in his chair.</p>
<p>“Tell me you ain’t been out there through the woods,” he said.</p>
<p>Emily sipped at her coffee.</p>
<p>“He’s covered his tracks pretty well,” she said. “But that little son of a bitch is livin’ in that shack.”</p>
<p>“Come on now.”</p>
<p>“I just don’t know for how long he’s been there,” she said.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Two mornings later Emily found the backdoor to the garage swinging on the breeze. Little marks by the keyhole cylinder. She had Bob inventory his tools and whatever valuables he could think of. In the end he had lost only a Phillips screwdriver and a half-gallon of Varsol. He said he would’ve be happier were the truck gone.</p>
<p>They fished a blue jay out of the pool the next morning and couldn’t figure out how he got in there and how he couldn’t fly off when he did. They’d slept little and Bob dragged ass when he went for his burial arms. He came back with a wood-handled trowel, the blade tarnished by the edges.</p>
<p>“Where’s your shovel?” Emily said.</p>
<p>“I do not know.”</p>
<p>She just looked at him, shoebox in her hands that carried the little birdbody.</p>
<p>When they made it to the plots they stood bewildered for maybe five minutes before Emily dropped the box and headed back to the house. Bob called after her but she couldn’t be turned. He knelt awkward on the turf, bit at his bottom lip as he found a workable position. Then he dug the hole with the trowel and tipped the shoebox. Beyond him in the makeshift graveyard all the crosses had been plucked and they were gone and the naked soils told no stories anymore about who they’d put under. The old man tamped earth down in the new plot and kept eyeballing the grounds to see what else might be out there with him.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>A lone cruiser sat in the road in front of the farmhouse. Officer McGuire heard Emily out as he stood on the flagstones behind the kitchen door and then he walked the fields, got smaller and smaller until the trees took him. An hour later he resurfaced at another opening perhaps a hundred yards to the west and made his way back to the house. He had red lines in his cheeks and forehead from the branches he’d caught. His boots had doubled in size by the mud and he left them outside and stood beside the kitchen counter in his stockinged feet.</p>
<p>“If anyone’s staying out there I couldn’t tell,” he said.</p>
<p>“He is,” Emily said. “You could see it’s been disturbed.”</p>
<p>“I did everythin’ but bust into the place,” said McGuire. “Sure, there’s signs that it’s been tampered with. But that could be raccoons or kids or goddamned anything.”</p>
<p>“It’s the son,” she said.</p>
<p>The cop looked to Bob and he just clamped his lips together and shook his head but once.</p>
<p>“The last anyone saw him he was banged up in Moosejaw and then supposedly put in hospital out west. Even then they were petty charges,” said the cop.</p>
<p>“It’s known pretty well that he did things he didn’t catch a charge for,” she said. “Even a young man like you has to have heard it.”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard a lot of things,” the cop said. “And I know the elder Campbell was a murderous son of a bitch but there just isn’t anything to say that it carried in the genes.”</p>
<p>Emily got up from the table and took the cop’s huge forearm in both hands through his jacket. Looked long into his eyes.</p>
<p>“I hope that’s the truth. ‘Cause I was in school with the father.”</p>
<p>McGuire stared back at her for a few moments and then down at the counter. Cleared his throat.</p>
<p>“You got my card to call me,” the cop said. “I’m not kiddin’ when I say you can get me on the horn anytime if something’s up.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” she said.</p>
<p>McGuire took his hat up off the counter and put in on. He stood high enough that his elbow sent a rack of hung pans rattling. He stopped them one by one. Then he went out with a nod and set about bashing his mudcaked boots together in the yard.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Two weeks later another girl was found half-eaten by a fertilizer slurry pit, this on a soy farm not ten miles away from Emily and Bob’s place. The cops came out to collect her body. The girl had been lost after a bush party, left out walking down the county road with her friend, both of them sixteen years old. The friend still hadn’t turned up. This time there were news trucks at the site and special investigators down from the city. There were floodlights ablaze on those grounds until after midnight and the farmer who lived there was kept under watch until the cops cleared him of any part in it and went back to guesswork and conjecture.</p>
<p>The next morning two squadcars pulled up outside while Emily was frying eggs. Four cops came to the door and they were all bruisers, but none as big as McGuire. He stood front and centre when Emily opened up for them.</p>
<p>“There any way to get to that shack in a vehicle?” he asked her.</p>
<p>“Not with what you’ve got,” she said. “But you can drive out across the rocky part a’ those fields if you want. Save you all but the trail-hike.”</p>
<p>McGuire tipped his hat to her and all of the cops went back to their cruisers. They rolled up over the curb and carried on through the highgrass, bucked hard as they made for the treeline.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>That evening after dinner Bob lay slumped in his armchair with his belt unbuckled and his thumbs hooked into the strapleather. Emily shook him by the shoulder. He stared at her wide-eyed. He was the kind that woke up all at once and she’d always been impressed by it.</p>
<p>“What is it, Em?” he said.</p>
<p>“I think I’d like to go to mass.”</p>
<p>She wore a red blouse and a long skirt that swam about her ankles. Her hair was pulled back tight to a ponytail.</p>
<p>“Well, alright,” Bob said, and set about putting his pants on proper.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>They’d gone to the old church on the hill. It had a lookout tower at the height of the grounds that saw over the entire county, the big inland river and the sea that it came from. Emily lit a five-dollar candle before mass. Candles set in three rows of glass tubes with the most of them aflame. The rows went upward to a plateau where the bones of Jesuit priests were kept in cases of wood and gold. Finger bones of the one. Part of a pelvis. Sheared-off shortribs. An entire skull sat on a narrow cushion in the largest encasement, a rectangular hole punched into it above one aural canal. Upon the darkwood walls of the church were pegs full with old crutches, canes, bracings. After the mass they were quick to get out of their pew, but Emily stopped and came back to the candles and lit three more and then she went out. She’d not paid for any of those and Bob didn’t bring it up.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>There were leaves and baubles of knotted wildgrass in the entryway when they got home, the front door open and drifting. Bob started to go inside and Emily grabbed a fistful of his shirtcloth.</p>
<p>“You don’t go in like that,” she said.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Are you kidding me, Bob?”</p>
<p>The old man stared into the dimlit house and he was breathing very hard. He shook his head and stepped out. Took hold of Emily at the elbow and moved her ahead of him. Walked back to the truck. There he asked Emily to get inside but she would only wait on the liner-step while he called the police. She tried to see into the almost pure dark on the property flanks. She could not see a damn thing. Bob got off the phone and they both climbed into the truck and locked the doors and then Bob backed out quick and drove to the concession fork where they would see the cops clear on the approach.</p>
<p>Waiting there they watched him come out into the road in a hunch, stepping nimbly between over the middle line of a barbed wire fence, perhaps fifty-yards from where they idled. He stood tall and full and looked all around. Emily nearly ducked but froze halfway. The Campbell boy had a short, dark beard and a good head of hair and decent clothes. He wore a backpack and seemed to be cinching it tighter. He loped across the road and in five strides he was gone. Bob started to put the truck in gear.</p>
<p>“My god,” Emily said. “Do we run him over?”</p>
<p>That caused Bob to switch his foot back to the brake and hold the truck. After a long, long minute the driver-side mirror lit in colors. Bob shifted into park again and waited with his one leg dancing on the floormatting. Emily reached over and steadied it by the kneecap. She spoke to him softly until they were not in the road alone anymore.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The police could not locate Campbell and over the months to come they searched the cabin and the grounds so many times they were forced to move on. Sightings were called in from highway rest-stops, diners, officers in other small towns as far as ten hours drive away. No new bodies turned up that could be attributed to the killer, and those he’d already made were buried in the town cemetery according to which side of the fence a Lutheran, or Presbyterian, or Catholic Jesus lived on. Emily and Bob paid out of pocket so that a small stone stood for the first girl, who nobody had come to collect or shed a tear over. When the snows came that stone became awful hard to find.</p>
<p>Toward Christmas Bob took ill and had fever dreams and delirium that scared Emily. In the early days of it the only symptom of sickness he had was that he kept feeling like he had to crap even when he’d just emptied his bowels. They’d not thought much of it until he was cold always, weak by his legs. Soon he had two lumps form in his asscrack just below the tailbone and in three days it got to where he couldn’t walk or sit and Emily drove him to the emergency room in the town hospital. He’d been taking her leftover hysterectomy pills behind slugs of whiskey but still he had to lay sideways on the benchseat with his head in her lap.</p>
<p>“This is stupid,” he said to her.</p>
<p>“I don’t think so,” she said.</p>
<p>The tires bucked on the snowpack and busted roadways and when they did Bob snarled and knuckled the flooring.</p>
<p>“Can’t you drive any smoother?” he said.</p>
<p>“I can stomp the brake and see if that don’t put you to sleep until we get there.”</p>
<p>“Sweet Jesus,” he said. “Come on now.”</p>
<p>He got in to triage and gave his information standing, went through to an examination room at a hobble and lay face down on the bed, his jeans pulled down for his ass to show. There he shooed Emily but she wouldn’t leave him.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen parts of you that you ain’t ever gonna see,” she said. “What more is there?”</p>
<p>“I don’t like you seein’ me sick like this.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine.”</p>
<p>“Hell it is,” he said. The words were part muffled by the pillow. He kept his face there until the doctor came in. The doc knew the name of Bob’s malady within seconds and it would have been called boils when they were younger but medicine called it a cyst now. It bothered Emily to hear it. She stood and squeezed Bob’s hand and he just looked at her. Then she did leave.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>She gathered him clean underwear and folded it neatly on the bed. Made up a small bag with his toothbrush in it along with other necessaries. She came out to the kitchen and looked at the clock. Went for the cupboard and pulled a bottle of the good whiskey and poured a small glass. The little house interior showed strange in the haphazard lighting that she’d made by flicking whatever switches caught her eye on the way through. The kitchen was almost entirely dark and Emily was dark inside it when the Campbell boy passed by the sliding doors and could be seen plain through the vertical blinds by the glow of the full and low-hanging moon. Emily stopped where she stood and so did her drink and so did her heart. She waited a minute after he’d gone before she went to the bedroom and dug under their bed for the rifle.</p>
<p>He was quarterway across the field toward the woods when she stepped out onto the cold concrete and sighted him in the lunar pale. The killer Campbell made his way slowly with the snow high on his shins. Emily had no coat on and his shape started to shake against the sight. She cussed herself out and went back into the house and came back with a toque pulled over her ears and with her coat unfastened and drifting on a gentle easterly. Nobody was out there anymore. Emily looked and looked and then she pulled off her hat and pitched it into the snow.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>When her husband was discharged home Emily tried to tend to him as he lay sideways watching nature shows on the television. He wore just boxer shorts and a t-shirt and his legs were patchy with grey hair but otherwise had muscle that seemed younger than the rest of him by decades. He’d oft get up and shuffle over to the bathroom or to the kitchen for another beer. Bob had been run through with saline and antibiotics and had color in his face again and part of his appetite back. Every few hours he had to settle in a sitz bath of warm water and salt to keep the lanced skin of his asscrack from any chance of re-infection. Emily never had to bother him once to do it. He’d have the plastic basin rinsed and filled and sat over the toilet and rinsed afterward before she could tell him anything. He kept the clock by it and Emily knew that he must have been in a great deal of pain in the days before if he were so hellbent on making sure he didn’t forget them.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>In the small hours before dawn Emily left the house and walked the fields. She had no flashlight but she saw the tracks clearly and trod in them to her knee. Every step felt unnatural to her and she thought about branching off through the snowpack but she did not want snow in her boots to wet her socks. She carried a leather shoulder bag and had the rifle slung high so that the butt wouldn’t drub the white. The new sun was but a sliver when she broke the treeline and travelled on through the pinerow corridor.</p>
<p>She’d enough layers to last the day through and had to loose one to stop herself from sweating as she sat on a stump above the clearing. The sun could not reach the cabin yet and the building sat there in its crooked way, dark and weird and without life. When sunlight finally hit the hollow Emily backed off into thicker cover and shook pins and needles out of her feet. She took up a handful of snow and ate it in bites. It was then that she heard a dry pop, what she thought might be a treelimb that broke loose somewhere in the wood behind her. But the sound had not come from there. She got down low and edged out toward the shortcliff.</p>
<p>There she watched as a patch of ground behind the shack rose, only visible by the fir-needles in the snow and by two perpendicular black lines that widened as the cellar hatch was lifted in fits by a man likely moving up a set of steps. Emily lay down on her front slowly. She had the rifle in both hands and readied and she drew the stock to her armpit. She dragged the shoulder bag in front of her as a rest. Her heart thumped and she tried to slow it. The hatch rose enough that she could see Campbell’s face and the length of his arms raising the trapdoor. She pulled. Crack of riflefire in the hollow. The door fell shut again.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Bob hauled a barrowful of paving stones and cement-mix from the truck to the garage. When he wheeled his way back he came upon a cruiser idling at the roadside. He eased the barrow down. The cop McGuire sat in the driver seat with no partner. The sidepanels were thick with claymud dried hard by the warm spring sun. The tires were filthy with runoff from the farmhouse lawn.</p>
<p>“Mornin’,” Bob said.</p>
<p>“You all doin’ okay out here?” McGuire said.</p>
<p>Bob nodded.</p>
<p>“We are,” he said. “How’re things with you?”</p>
<p>“Quiet,” McGuire said. He raised his huge hand and put the car into gear and drove off down the county road.</p>
<p>In the house Emily slept late. She’d woken just once in the night and had hustled to the bathroom blind and by the memory of her footsoles and then came back to bed. Her dreams were many and each started strange on the heels of the one before. She dreamt of waters and blackwoods and a barn foundering and collapsing on itself while a lone dog scattered not fast enough in the sidefields. She dreamt of driving in a car with no roofcovers. She dreamt of the dead girls, daughters all and none of them hers.</p>
<p>Emily got up and brushed her teeth and combed through her hair for a little while. She stepped outside onto the sunwarmed pavestones behind the house. An early spring had brought the snows down to sopmush over the fields beyond. She wore her bathrobe and walked the cement in her slippers. Bob had drawn the poolcovers back and the waters were hung through with grit and grass and twigs. Emily took hold of the fencerail and studied the pool. She was about to go but stopped. There in the far shallows spun a tiny, brown body, held under by a tangle of mossy branchlets, the tail trailing wide and drawing in the water gently. After a long time watching it she went for the net.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At night, when the temperature fell to freezing and he couldn’t sleep, William Taylor sat out on his porch and watched the blue-black land roll away from him, listening to the soft hush of the snakes, their rattles calling out quietly. He had one of his own, an old one that his son had given him years ago, toothless and poisonless, its mouth crumpled and sad looking. But the black eyes were still mean, sharp, and he could still scare children and a few men too. When children stayed in the guest cabins and he had to do his snake man routine for the families, he brought her out and let her bite him, try to, again and again, striking fast, still not knowing that she was harmless. It scared the hell out of the kids. They always wanted to know her name but he had never thought of one.</p>
<p>It started to rain and the red, dusty earth thickened until it turned to mud and the sound of the rainfall grew louder and he couldn’t hear the snakes anymore, couldn’t hear anything at all. He stood to go inside but saw the light come on in the tack shed. The light flickered, made the shadows swim in the rain, and was gone, blown out and William waited for the smell of the kerosene but it drowned in the rain.</p>
<p>Give them until morning, he thought.</p>
<p>After the war, when he traveled around up north, anywhere to stay away from the boy and his mother, he had found himself often enough in tack sheds or woodsheds, lying awake all night, begging for sleep, begging no one would find him.</p>
<p>He looked down the hill and in the moonlight saw the rain running silver and black over the earth, running toward the arroyo.</p>
<p>“Fuck, it’s cold.” He looked over at the tack shed again and went inside.</p>
<p>He listened to them talk about the murder and shut the radio off when the announcer started with his two cents. Two cents was all that man was worth, he thought, always running his mouth without ever saying a thing. Dead was dead, cut up bad or not. He opened the front door looked over at the tack shed. The sun was low and lighted the shed with a bourbon-colored glow and he wondered where the body had been found.</p>
<p>The tack shed was empty and he thought it must have been cold in there during the night. The smell of rain and wet cats hung in the air. The lantern sat on a rail, the glass smoked and blackened though he hadn’t used it yet. He ran his finger inside the glass and the soot was greasy, still fresh. A shaft of cold air left over from the night ran down his neck and he shook it off.</p>
<p>In the ground outside he saw the vague imprint of a sharp, pointed boot, the toe dug into the dirt. He squinted in the sun and thought the drifter wouldn’t last long, not out here, not on foot. A man would do better to wander the Badlands without water than to roam over these snake-infested rocks. He had found a cluster of them under his truck just days ago, three or four of them all tangled together, right under the front tire, looking like some devil’s dessert and he nearly stepped in them. It scared the shit out of him. He thought they must be getting worse, coming closer, breeding faster.</p>
<p>That afternoon he sat in the threadbare shade of the desert willow out front his house and smoked a cigar. The radio was on in the kitchen and he could hear them talking on the call-in show, in a panic, scared. It was the third girl in as many months. There might be more out there, waiting to be found. William’s cigar went out and he looked at it, the end wet and gnawed, and he thought he should listen to the news a little more. He always turned the radio off when the music stopped and the voices started. Under the cigar he could still smell the rain, hidden in the earth.</p>
<p>They were loud that evening. He heard the rattling in the kitchen and thought they must be setting up a nest under the house. Maybe on the front porch. He had planted marigolds around the house, even threw a few seeds under, but all they did was look pretty when the sun hit them. He went to the window and tired to remember who told him the flowers would keep snakes away.</p>
<p>He saw the shadows move slowly outside and knew he was being watched. The moon was far away, hidden somewhere in the mountains up north, and he opened the front door and looked down at the cabins and over at the tack shed but it was too dark to see anything. The snakes called out to each other and he could still smell the heat from the day, the scorched air and damp, musty earth and he knew someone was looking right at him, watching him, hiding.</p>
<p>He woke in the middle of the night and looked at the window over his bed but they were gone and all he saw was the moon, thin and bright in the sky in a way that made him hungry and when he turned on the radio they were talking about her again, like they knew her. He threw the radio at the wall. It started to rain again and he knew it would be a sharp and cold rain.</p>
<p>William took his Remington with him, hung lazily by his side and opened the shed.<br />
The man lay in the back, asleep, a saddle blanket for a pillow, his arms over his chest and a silly, bashful smile on his face. Streaked, red mud ran across his cheeks like blood and covered his pants and boots. He grunted at the sun in his eyes. Either the man had a hell of a sunburn or it was the first Indian William had seen with blonde hair. It looked like sun-bleached wheat.</p>
<p>“Wake up.”</p>
<p>The Indian turned away and William smiled, knew he was awake, faking. He thought about throwing his old snake in the shed, scare the Indian right off the land.</p>
<p>“I’m about to make breakfast if you want some.”</p>
<p>The Indian rolled over and smiled.</p>
<p>“Thought you were just going to run me off,” he said.</p>
<p>“I was taught to be hospitable.”</p>
<p>“I can see that.” The Indian nodded at the Remington.</p>
<p>“Taught to be careful, too.” William stepped back from the door. The Indian stood and William raised the Remington automatically, his finger on the trigger. “Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>The Indian smiled again, tight-lipped, watching the Remington.</p>
<p>“Fuck, you must be the tallest Indian I ever seen. What are you, seven foot?”</p>
<p>“Six and a half. How about that Injun killer?” He nodded to the Remington. “Any chance of it going down a touch?”</p>
<p>“Any chance of you going down a touch?”</p>
<p>“I stoop when I walk.”</p>
<p>“You’re still too damned tall.” William lowered the Remington and stepped outside and waited for the Indian.</p>
<p>He came out and looked at the cabins that scattered down the sloped land and frowned.</p>
<p>“What’s with all the out buildings?”</p>
<p>“It’s a dude ranch.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“I’m still trying to figure that one out myself.”</p>
<p>“There people staying here?”</p>
<p>“Not right now.”</p>
<p>“You’re the owner, then?”</p>
<p>“No, guy from Chicago. Named Richard.”</p>
<p>“Why’s that sign say ‘Duke’s Place’?” He nodded to a carved, wood sign over the tack shed.</p>
<p>“He gave himself an authentic cowboy nickname.”</p>
<p>They walked up to William’s house and the Indian stood on the porch and looked around, shaking his head a little, frowning a little.</p>
<p>“Last time I was here this was all open land. Free and unowned.”</p>
<p>“Most of that to the west is parkland.”</p>
<p>“Parkland.”</p>
<p>“A national park.”</p>
<p>“I know what you meant.”</p>
<p>William shrugged and went into the kitchen.</p>
<p>“You got a name?” William asked.</p>
<p>“John.”</p>
<p>“John?”</p>
<p>“John.” He followed William into the kitchen and stood in the doorway, watching him, smiling at him. “You expecting some other kind of name?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Maybe Bigfoot, Sasquatch.”</p>
<p>“Would you believe Long John Silver?”</p>
<p>“Not thin enough.”</p>
<p>“I used to be. Like a beanpole. Birth name of John Silvertail and it was pretty much a given.”</p>
<p>William looked out the window at the clear sky. It was wide open, empty in a way that made him wish he were alone and he knew the wind would be cool, fresh after the night’s rain, the rattlesnakes asleep in the rocks.</p>
<p>“Why you sleeping in sheds, Long Johns?”</p>
<p>“Long Johns are underwear.”</p>
<p>“How about my question? You drifting? Looking for work?”</p>
<p>“Looking for family.”</p>
<p>William started coffee and looked at the Indian. He smelled like leather and wet cats and William grunted quietly to himself and wondered about that cat smell.</p>
<p>“How long you been out there?” He asked.</p>
<p>“A while.”</p>
<p>“How many nights in the tack shed?”</p>
<p>“Two.”</p>
<p>“Before that?”</p>
<p>“Somewhere else.”</p>
<p>“Not my business?”</p>
<p>“Nope.”</p>
<p>“You like scrambled eggs?”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah.”</p>
<p>He ate six eggs like it was nothing and William put bacon in the pan and poured out more coffee and looked at the Indian’s knuckles and wondered where the blood came from. He had tried to wash it of but it was still there, between the cracks of his hardened skin.</p>
<p>“I was fishing,” he said.</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“The blood. It’s from fish.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“Your face sure speaks for you.” He laughed and kept eating, watching William.</p>
<p>William sat on the porch and lit a cigar, the Remington still close to him, behind the bench, and he heard the thunder beating the land though the sky was clear. He had told John to take a bath and offered him clean clothes but nothing was his size except for some socks. The floor in the bathroom grunted under the Indian’s weight every now and again.</p>
<p>He turned on the radio, propped it on the windowsill behind him, and they were still talking, going into detail, not giving the dead any privacy. She had been torn apart, they said, by someone strong as a bear and just as tall, and if it weren’t for all the cutting they may well have thought it an animal killing.</p>
<p>John came out on the porch and William turned the radio off.</p>
<p>“Don’t turn that off on my account.”</p>
<p>“They used to play music. There used to be a man at the station that played Benny Goodman all the time. Now they just talk.”</p>
<p>“Benny Goodman?”</p>
<p>“Big band music.”</p>
<p>“I know. Just wouldn’t have thought you a fan.”</p>
<p>“I love the clarinet.”</p>
<p>John sat down on the bench and kicked his legs out in front of him and wiggled his toes.</p>
<p>“Thanks for the socks.”</p>
<p>“Welcome.”</p>
<p>“It’s nice and quiet here.”</p>
<p>“Now. In the off season.”</p>
<p>“Does it get crowded?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Sometimes. Lot of families come here in summer. Lot of children.”</p>
<p>“I like children. They’re peaceful.”</p>
<p>“What kind of children do you know? Mutes?”</p>
<p>“I haven’t seen mine in years. I miss them like crazy.”</p>
<p>“I saw my boy four years ago. Another four will do before the next time. Longer even.”</p>
<p>“You don’t mean that.”</p>
<p>“I do. He’s an entitled asshole.” His cigar went out and he looked at it, chewed up to a stubby inch and he threw it out into the marigolds. The thunder rolled through the sky again and he looked for clouds or rain but it was clear. He reached back and turned the radio on and someone was making a speech, promising justice for the girls, promising to let them rest in peace.</p>
<p>John switched it off and stood and looked out over the land. He had to hunch so his head didn’t hit the awning. He looked down at William, his eyes black and angry looking, lost in foul thoughts, and his mouth twisted into a shy smile.</p>
<p>“Why you switch that off?” William asked.</p>
<p>“I thought I heard a motor.”</p>
<p>“So what if you did?”</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t get in trouble for taking me in?”</p>
<p>“It’s my damned house.”</p>
<p>“Is it?”</p>
<p>“And there wasn’t any motor. There’s nothing to hear out there but snakes and thunder.”</p>
<p>“I should get going.”</p>
<p>“Stay the night. On the couch.”</p>
<p>“No, I think I’ve imposed long enough.”</p>
<p>“Suit yourself. It’s going to rain really hard soon enough, though.”</p>
<p>“How do you know that? The sky is clear.”</p>
<p>“Thought you types could read the weather.”</p>
<p>“Indians?”</p>
<p>“Hobos, drifters.”</p>
<p>John looked at the sky again, looked over the land, his face rigid, hardened by the wind and his blonde hair burned brightly in the sun. He was still sweating from the heat of the bathwater and his shirt pressed against his shoulders and his arms and William looked at him and thought about the rifle, behind the bench, hard to get at quickly. John turned to him and smiled. It was a silly, shy smile, the same smile little girls gave him when he handled a snake and they thought he was some kind of magic.</p>
<p>“I sure can’t read the rain up there,” John said.</p>
<p>A snake rattled at them and they looked down at the floor.</p>
<p>“Damn things are under the house, aren’t they?”</p>
<p>“I’d say so.”</p>
<p>It didn’t rain but the wind picked up and blew the thin pink flowers from the desert willow, scattered them over the dirt in front of William’s house and they died quickly in the heat. William came out of the tack shed and looked at his house and felt crowded and tight-chested just knowing that Indian was in there and he thought about when he got back from the war, how he felt crowded all the time. Maybe he should go back north to the mountains, he thought, leave the house and the job and all the goddamn snakes to the Indian. He emptied a bucket of soapy water on the ground and looked down the hill, to the cabins scattered in the Cimarron trees and he was glad there were no guests.</p>
<p>John came out on the porch eating an apple and shielded his eyes to look at William. He looked like the owner already.</p>
<p>“What you doing down there?” He asked.</p>
<p>“Cleaning.”</p>
<p>“The tack shed?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“I thought it was pretty clean.”</p>
<p>“It was.”</p>
<p>“So why did you clean it?”</p>
<p>“There was some awful smell in there. Like wet cats.”</p>
<p>“What the hell do wet cats smell like?”</p>
<p>“Like wet dogs but worse.”</p>
<p>“Okay.” John took another bite of the apple and smiled. “Say, I noticed some steaks in your freezer. It may be asking too much but I’m a heck of a cook with steaks if you want me to make them for supper.”</p>
<p>“Alright.”</p>
<p>John smiled and pushed his hair back, off his forehead. Wind blew and over the hills the air was thick and red with the small clouds of distant dust-storms.</p>
<p>William looked at the sky and wondered if it rained hard enough would it flush the snakes from under the house. He shook his head to himself. Territorial fuckers would probably just come back anyway.</p>
<p>He went up to the house and started sweeping the porch and he heard the steaks searing in the pan and felt like a housewife, or a couple of old maids and he wanted to be alone again.<br />
“God damn.” He put the broom away and went and sat at the kitchen table and lit his cigar.</p>
<p>“You smoke that in the house?” John asked.</p>
<p>“My house.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>He got up and turned on the radio, turned it loud, and fingered the dial, switching stations, looking for music, getting angry with all the voices. He settled on the weather report but it only told him what he already knew and he cursed to himself when the weather finished and they started in on the girls again. A few months ago, one of them was sure she was being spied on at night, through her bedroom window, someone watching her in the dark, but her father had laughed her off, told her there was nothing out there but miles of empty land.</p>
<p>The last girl had been seen in town with a man, tall and blonde and handsome. Some kind of drifter no one knew. It was all the police had to go on and they held onto it tight, repeated it, and the announcer said the police were gunning for this man and William cringed. He looked up and found John watching him and he turned off the radio and blew smoke in the air. He cursed himself silently for smoking inside, the house would stink for days now. John licked his lip, kept watching him.</p>
<p>“By that description there, that could almost be me.”</p>
<p>“They said handsome.”</p>
<p>John turned back to the counter and started slicing onions and William thought he sure knew his way around a knife.</p>
<p>“I used to be thought handsome.”</p>
<p>“I figured that.”</p>
<p>“But they didn’t say Indian. They would have thrown that in. Nothing you folks like more than gunning for an Injun.”</p>
<p>“It’s because you guys scream funny.”</p>
<p>The steaks were close to raw in the middle. Blood ran down John’s fork and he licked it off, smiling, and William pushed his plate away, his steak untouched.</p>
<p>“I’m not hungry.”</p>
<p>“Don’t know how you can pass this up.”</p>
<p>“I’m tired. Gonna lay down.”</p>
<p>“Like a nap?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, like a nap.”</p>
<p>“In your bedroom?”</p>
<p>“Where the hell else would I lay down?”</p>
<p>John shrugged and started in on William’s steak.</p>
<p>He fell asleep quickly with the soft afternoon sun coming through the open window and the wind that came into the room was warm and dry with no smell of rain and he woke every few minutes, sure that John was standing in the doorway, watching him sleep, and he thought about the girl telling her father someone was outside her window.</p>
<p>Her neck had been snapped, like a bear toying with a cat, before they started in with the knife. William woke and went to the toilet to throw up.</p>
<p>William tried the phone but the line was dead. He followed the wires until they disappeared under the house, into the crawl space and he stood with the sun at his back and listened to the snakes. He thought knowing his luck they would have set up camp right on the power box. He hadn’t heard of snakes eating through wire before. John looked down at him from behind the window, his face blurred by the warped windowpane, and he grinned, or William thought he did.</p>
<p>He started down the hill toward the cabins. The desert wind blew cold, steamed William’s breath, and he knew it would be freezing that night, cold even in his house with the fire burning. The sun broke in long, rust-colored shadows over the land and spilled over the rocks and he went into the only cabin that had a porch. Richard called it the honeymoon suite but William wondered what kind of man went on a honeymoon with his children.<br />
He dialed Blair twice before that girl he had picked up.</p>
<p>“This is William Taylor. Blair around?”</p>
<p>“No, sir.” Her voice was high, like she wanted to sound younger, cuter, than she was, wanted to sound like she had once been, long ago. “He’s out with all that’s been happening.”</p>
<p>“I can imagine. Tell him I called.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“Tell him to come see me as soon as he can. Tell him to come armed. I can’t find my damned Remington.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Just tell him to come, armed and in a hurry.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“Did you write it down?”</p>
<p>“No, I can remember that.”</p>
<p>“Write it down.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>He hung up and thought she wouldn’t write it down. Not now that she had been told to. There was a radio on the counter in the kitchenette, the window looking down toward the corral, where the horses lived during the season, and William went and turned it on, listened to them mumbling, their voices frantic and always running. He wondered where they learned to talk like that, without breaks, without tone or volume and he closed his eyes and he heard the indignant wailing of a clarinet. Not Benny Goodman, but it didn’t matter.</p>
<p>John was waiting for him on the porch, sitting on the bench, his face dark and hard as carved wood, but he smiled. Out in the rocks the snakes were waking, calling, their rattles going quietly in the dark.</p>
<p>“Where you been?” John asked.</p>
<p>“Working.”</p>
<p>“Doing what?”</p>
<p>“Taking care. It’s what a caretaker does.”</p>
<p>“Down in the cabins?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“It still hasn’t rained.”</p>
<p>“No, not yet.”</p>
<p>“Still think it will?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, now it’s dark out. It’ll rain. Sometime tonight.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” He looked down at William. “You okay?”</p>
<p>“I’m good.”</p>
<p>“Troublesome nap you had earlier.”</p>
<p>“I guess.”</p>
<p>“I saw your snake. There’s something wrong with him.”</p>
<p>“He’s got no teeth.”</p>
<p>“That’d be a blow to the ego, for a rattlesnake.”</p>
<p>“I guess.”</p>
<p>“You catch him yourself?”</p>
<p>“No,” William said.</p>
<p>“Around here, it’d be like shooting fish in a barrel.”</p>
<p>William looked at him, at his dark, happy eyes and girlish mouth. His head was full of people he didn’t want in there, like it had been after the war, and he needed to move, to run, and no matter what he did he could never breath right, never feel clear, not for years.</p>
<p>It rained just before dawn and William lay in bed and thought about the girls. They would have been pretty, he thought, with healthy skin and smooth, softly scented hair. They didn’t say it on the news but he knew it by how they spoke. The gloomy, pink light of daybreak came into his room, through the open window, with the clean, wet wind and he listened to the rainwater run over the ground, building up as it ran down the hill, toward the arroyo. The snakes had finally shut up. He wondered if they could swim.</p>
<p>His house was empty, the blankets folded at the side of the couch and he went out on the porch and looked out over the land and over at the tack shed and it’s door sat open and there was no one around for miles. The moon still hung in the dark end of the sky and it lit the desert willow and the wet earth with a tired, lonesome-looking glow. Thunder rolled across the desert and the rain picked up, hit hard into the dust and William smiled to himself. He liked the bad weather.</p>
<p>He was oiling the children’s saddles on his porch when Blair drove up and ran from the car. Within two feet he was soaked through and he stopped, stood still in the rain, looking around him, his wide, alligator smile breaking his face in two and he looked up at William and laughed.</p>
<p>“This is some rain,” he called.</p>
<p>William nodded. Blair walked up onto the porch and shook himself off.</p>
<p>“Is that coffee I can smell?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Got a spare cup?”</p>
<p>“It’s on the stove, help yourself.”</p>
<p>“Don’t mind if I do.” He took off his hat and boots and set them near the door and went inside. William moved a saddle off the bench to make room for Blair and he came back and sat down, holding his coffee near his mouth. “Took me a while to figure out which William had called me.”</p>
<p>“She didn’t write it down?”</p>
<p>“She can’t write. That’s the only explanation. Told me some man had called. Think she might have called you a dude.”</p>
<p>“Long as she didn’t call me a dud,” William said. “You armed?”</p>
<p>“Got something in the trunk.”</p>
<p>“She tell you to come armed?”</p>
<p>“No. But I was a boy scout.” The rain ran down Blair’s clothes and pooled like dirty, watered-down blood on the floorboards. “Everything okay, William?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I guess.”</p>
<p>“Solitude getting to you?”</p>
<p>“No.” He shook his head. He looked at the tack shed and knew inside the ground would be wet, soaked through, the smell of cats still strong as the wind pushed on the thin walls.<br />
“No, I guess it wouldn’t. Not you at any rate.”</p>
<p>“Had a drifter come through.”</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I let him stay the night.”</p>
<p>“He steal something?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I haven’t looked. Didn’t think to. Not with all this talk about those girls on the radio.”</p>
<p>“Shit.” Blair sat back. “Not you too.”</p>
<p>“Me too what?”</p>
<p>“You been calling up the stations? Making an ass you yourself?”</p>
<p>“No. Just listening. I heard the description of your drifter.”</p>
<p>“Which one?”</p>
<p>“There’s more than one?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I hate those radio programs. All the crazies call up, shouting, screaming, calling for heads and saying I can’t do my job right, making shit up. They used to play good music on those stations.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>“So, what? You took in a drifter who fit the description?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Biggest, blondest Indian I’ve ever seen. Come to think of it he was the only blonde Indian I’ve ever seen. Must have been seven feet tall.”</p>
<p>Blair grinned, his eyes murky and lost, out in the rain. Wind blew the cold air at them, threw the rainfall around in the sky and settled quietly. “I knew a blonde Indian once,” Blair said. “Years ago. Had this crazy yellow hair, looked like a goddamn canola field. He worked the rodeo, rode bulls. He was on his way to being a big-time rodeo star. Had a stupid name, but not like you’d expect from an Indian. Long John Silver.”</p>
<p>“That’s who I took in.”</p>
<p>“Long John Silver? No. He died about fifteen years ago. Maybe more. Found his body over in the National Park, but before it was parkland.”</p>
<p>“Drifter I had said his name was Long John Silver. Birth name was John Silvertail.”</p>
<p>Blair grunted. “Same name, different Indian. Like I said, my Long John Silver is dead.”</p>
<p>“How’d he die?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. He was found all cut up, high in the rocks, over west in the tableland. But they never tried too hard to figure that one out. They didn’t try too hard, back then, with the Indians.”</p>
<p>William woke before dawn and it was cold, well below freezing, as cold as it had been many of those nights, after the war, when he had traveled aimlessly in the north, hiding. He made coffee in the dark, the smell filling the house and went out on the porch and walked down to the desert willow, walking slowly, carefully, sure there were snakes waiting to be stepped on, waiting to bite. He used to catch them, when he was younger, when his hands were faster than his thoughts, and he’d hold them high, under the jaw and watch their black, killing eyes soften to sadness as they waited to die.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first time I set eyes on Lloyd Toomey was on the far side of my north field. From a distance he didn’t look much thicker than the fencepost he was stood next to, and as I neared, he didn’t flesh-out none, either. A dozen or so of the larger sows was gathered at the fence, all pushin and shovin to get their turn at the somethin-or-other Lloyd was dealin from a cloth bag. The pigs seemed to like whatever it was, but I didn’t. Not a bit.</p>
<p>A few years back I’d had some shenanigans with Penny Loveday’s boys, Wendell and Caleb. Them two boys fed their mother’s indigestible cornbread to Abigail over the course of a week, just to see what’d happen. Abby (who aint an eatin pig) gobbled up that cornbread like most ever’thang that’s laid before her, and like most ever’body whoever tried Penny Loveday’s cornbread, Abby’s internal workins seized up like a broke-down tractor in a dust storm. If she’d been an eatin pig, I’da just bled the poor gal to put her outta her misery, but I would no sooner have kilt Abby than I woulda kilt my own wife, God rest her soul.</p>
<p>‘I’d appreciate you not feedin them pigs,’ I shouted as soon as I was in hollerin distance. ‘Aint you read the signs?’</p>
<p>Lloyd froze with his hand inside the cloth bag. ‘I don’t read so good.’</p>
<p>‘You gettin fresh with me, son?’</p>
<p>‘Nossir. Caint read nor write nothin but my own name.’ He pulled his hand from the bag, wiped his palm on his behind and slid his cap from his head. ‘I like your pigs.’</p>
<p>‘I like em too at fifty dollars a hog. You go pluggin em up with whatever it is you feedin em, and I’m goan have to bleed em early. So jump back on your bicycle there, and head on up the road before I call Sheriff Tindal. Go on, boy.’</p>
<p>I guessed when he started blubbin it didn’t have much to do with me rappin his rump for him.</p>
<p>‘Well, what in God’s name you cryin about?’ I asked him.</p>
<p>He mopped his tears with his cap and shrugged.</p>
<p>‘Well, come on. I aint goan ask twice.’ To the boy’s credit, he did manage to gather himself some. He tugged his cap back on and drew his coat sleeve across the wet of his nose.</p>
<p>‘Been ridin this here bicycle into town every mornin and fetchin back supplies for Mrs Cooper.’ He pointed up the dirt road. ‘Mrs Cooper lives over yonder hill.’</p>
<p>‘I know where the Cooper place is,’ I said, ‘but what’s that old biddy got to do with you ballin?’</p>
<p>‘Well, sir, every mornin I ride past your pigs they always look up at me, and goddammit if they don’t seem pleased to see me.’</p>
<p>‘Course they pleased to see ya. You feedin em, aintcha?’</p>
<p>‘Nossir. Not when they first started smilin at me.’</p>
<p>‘Shit,’ I said. ‘Pigs caint smile, boy.’</p>
<p>‘Yessir. These pigs can. With they eyes.’ He leaned over the fence and pointed at Abby. ‘That pretty lady almost broke my heart when she winked those peepers at me.’</p>
<p>I tipped my cap back and scratched my head. ‘Son, are you touched in some way?’</p>
<p>‘I never laid a finger on em. Not a one.’</p>
<p>‘I mean, did your momma drop you on your head when you was a tadpole?’</p>
<p>The boy’s face glazed over like Abby’d just squeezed an onion under his nose (Abby was no lady when it came to passin wind), then his cheeks blossomed rosy and I thought he was goan take to ballin again.</p>
<p>‘I know’d what you gettin at,’ he said. ‘I aint stupid.’</p>
<p>‘Ah, hush up, I didn’t mean nothin by it.’ I felt somethin awful now. If my wife had still been this side of the dirt, she’da give me hell for my meanness. I waded through the hogs and grabbed Abby by her rope collar, slapped her rump to get her movin toward the fence. She squealed some and tried to bully me with her hefty shoulders, but I managed to yank her head up. ‘This un?’ I said.</p>
<p>A dopey grin ripened on his face and he started noddin like the fool I thought he was. ‘That’s her alright. Look at her smilin now.’</p>
<p>Abby greased his outstretched hand with snout snot, the same beady-eyed indifference on her rusty face as every other Duroc in the field.</p>
<p>‘I suppose,’ I said, ‘from a certain angle, she could have what you might call a “smiley eye”.’</p>
<p>‘Yessir,’ he said, still beamin. ‘Just like my Joy.’</p>
<p>‘Joy?’</p>
<p>‘Yessir. Joy’s my wife.’</p>
<p>The boy stopped smilin then, dumped his face in his cap and took to ballin. My meanness came on then too, and I wanted to shake him by his bony shoulders, but I could hear my wife yellin from some place other than this earth (by golly could that woman holler), and so I checked my meanness at the door. For no short time after Alice passed over, I was taken to these very same bouts of teary fancifulness. I had a pretty good idea what the answer would be, but I had to ask.</p>
<p>‘Dead?’ he shrieked. ‘Lord no. She done run off with my best pal, Joe Puddentane.’ He started dry sobbin and hitchin those bony shoulders up and down. Sounded like a goddamn mule. ‘Aint been married but a year when she told me she and Joe was movin down to Bakersfield on account of Joe inheritin two hundred dollars from his Aunt Cecelia. Joy said Joe had got himself a plot of land and was gonna make somethin of himself. Said I weren’t nothin but a broke ass and that she was tired of livin in a leaky old house with no picket fence and no nice things. Lord I miss her so bad.’</p>
<p>‘Well, sure you do,’ I said when his face hit his cap again, and then under my breath, ‘she sounds like a hell of a gal.’</p>
<p>Abby poked her snout through the fence and gave his balls a good sniff. The boy jumped back, sprawled over his bicycle and tumbled into the road. I tried like hell not to laugh. Picturin my wife shakin her head at me did the trick.</p>
<p>‘Easy now, son. You gettin yourself all whipped up for no good reason I can see. What are you, twenty?’</p>
<p>He sat up in the dirt and dusted off his sleeves. ‘Twenty-two.’</p>
<p>‘Well, hell… seems to me like you got your whole life ahead of you. I say to hell with the both of em.’ His eyes nearly popped out when I said that. ‘You don’t need friends like Joe Puddentane, and no self-respectin fella would be with a woman such as Joy.’</p>
<p>The boy jumped to his feet. ‘Now you just wait a minute…’</p>
<p>‘Hold your horses, youngblood, and listen to a man who knows a thing or two about such things. I met my wife when I was just a tad shy of your age, and she wouldna run off with no Joe Puddentane. Sure she had a hellish tongue in her head, but we worked at our marriage. Hard work sometimes, but things worth havin generally are.’</p>
<p>The boy hung his head, screwed his cloth bag up and clutched it to his scrawny chest.</p>
<p>‘Now it seems to me that neither of you was up to workin at your marriage, let alone fightin for it. Hell, I’da socked Joe Puddentane right in the mouth and either put Joy over my knee or kicked her out the door. Them’s your choices, boy. Go fetch her back or stop ballin about it.’</p>
<p>The boy’s head sprang up. ‘Sock my pal Joe Puddentane in the mouth…? We been pals since… since.…’</p>
<p>‘Sure, sure,’ I said. ‘Just as I figured.’</p>
<p>‘Figured?’</p>
<p>‘Boy, you didn’t lose Joy, you gave her away.’ I started shooin my hogs back toward their pens, but before I got a single one of em movin, the boy’s face was in his cap again – shoulders hitchin again. God damn my meanness. I hung my own head, listened to the boy gather up his bicycle. When I looked up he was saddled and about to push off, all red faced and snotty as a schoolboy.</p>
<p>‘Son?’ I called.</p>
<p>‘What?’ He sniffed, wet eyes fixed over yonder hill.</p>
<p>‘What’s your name?’</p>
<p>He cuffed his tears but didn’t turn. ‘Lloyd. Lloyd Toomey.’</p>
<p>‘Well, Lloyd, you promise me you won’t feed these here hogs with Penny Loveday’s cornbread?’</p>
<p>‘Who’s Penny Loveday?’</p>
<p>‘That’s good enough for me. Next time you passin, feel free to feed the hogs.’</p>
<p>Lloyd swallowed and turned. ‘Honest?’</p>
<p>‘Sure,’ I said. ‘I think Abby’d be pleased to see you.’ I gave Abby a slap on the rump and she squealed some.</p>
<p>‘Thanks, mister.’ Lloyd pushed off up the road, grinnin like the fool I hoped he wasn’t.</p>
<p>‘Lloyd?’ I called.</p>
<p>‘Yessir.’</p>
<p>‘Call me Bill.’</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>That evenin, as the sun was settin over my west field, I took a beer and a glass of brandy wine and sat by my wife’s grave. I removed last night’s flowers, which were still fresh and sweet-smellin, and replaced them with a just-picked posy of daises, then poured the wine into the earth and sat back to watch the night ink-out the honeyed skyline. Alice loved a sunset.</p>
<p>‘Met a dumb sonofabitch this mornin,’ I said, adjusting the posy I had laid afore Alice’s headstone, ‘and as much as I wouldn’t wanna be no snivellin little wet-behind-the-ears dummy like that, I caint help thinking we’d still be together if I had a pinch of Lloyd Toomey in me. Goddamn my meanness.’ I patted the wine-soaked grass. ‘I miss you, my love.’</p>
<p>I drank my beer down slowly and watched the black horizon devour the sun. ‘Kid dudn’t know how lucky he is.’</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>The followin mornin I took a stroll over to the north field, and sure enough, there was Lloyd, holdin court over maybe fifty Durocs and dealin from his cloth bag. The cheeky sonbitch had climbed the fence this time and was gettin hog-hammered on all sides. Still didn’t knock the goofy grin from his face. That only happened when he saw me comin.</p>
<p>By the time I got there Lloyd had hopped back over the fence, stowed his cloth bag in the basket of his bicycle.</p>
<p>‘Mornin, Bill,’ Lloyd said, his head bowed sheepish and his cap busy in his hands.</p>
<p>‘Lloyd.’</p>
<p>‘Sorry bout climbin your fence. Some of the runts was havin trouble gettin fed. I’m sure the big uns don’t mean no harm, but they’s greedy as pigs.’</p>
<p>‘Fancy that.’</p>
<p>Lloyd snorted and looked up. ‘Greedy as pigs, get it?’</p>
<p>I did not smile.</p>
<p>‘Well,’ Lloyd said, ‘I best be gettin on. Mrs Cooper must be wonderin where I got to.’</p>
<p>‘That old biddy pay you for your fetchin and carryin?’</p>
<p>‘Nossir. Wouldn’t take it if she offered, neither. Since Joy left me I aint been eatin so good. Mrs Cooper cooks me up stew ever Sunday. Said I was lookin cadalavos… cadabralous… cad—’</p>
<p>‘Cadaverous?’</p>
<p>‘That’s the dog!’</p>
<p>I frowned, picked my cap from my head and armed sweat from my brow.</p>
<p>Lloyd’s face drooped like a broke-neck chicken. ‘I know’d what you gonna say. You don’t want me feedin your pigs no more.’</p>
<p>‘Lloyd, I got no problem with you feedin the hogs.’ I huffed and looked off up the dirt road, shakin my head. ‘I said some mean things yesterday and I shouldna. My wife always said I was a mean sonofabitch, God rest her soul.’</p>
<p>‘What happened to her?’</p>
<p>I snapped my head around. ‘Say what?’</p>
<p>‘Nothin. I shouldna said nothin.’</p>
<p>‘No. It’s fine. Aint no big secret anyways. Nothin ever is around here.’ I waded through the hogs and propped my forearms on the fence. ‘Bout eight years ago, Alice took a tumble in the kitchen, whopped her head on the counter. Dead before she hit the floor.’</p>
<p>‘Oh, my.’</p>
<p>I looked away.</p>
<p>‘Does it ever stop hurtin?’</p>
<p>‘What kind of a dumb question is that?’</p>
<p>‘I had no business askin such a thing. I’m so stupid. Stupid, stupid, stupid.’</p>
<p>‘Quit bashin your head before you break somethin,’ I shouted.</p>
<p>Lloyd quit smackin himself, then peeked up from his bowed head. Stared at me all sorry-eyed and said: ‘Well… does it?’</p>
<p>‘It’ll stop hurtin when I’m dead and not a day before.’</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>The hogs disappeared up to the north field every mornin for the next two weeks or so. I let Lloyd get on with it. I got the feelin I made him uncomfortable. I know his dummy questions did me.</p>
<p>I took my visits with Alice at sunset. Drank too much. Talked too much. One evenin I suffered a bout of fancifulness, cryin like a dummy. Alice did not speak a word to soothe me.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>I pulled the truck up outside Johnson’s Hardware in time to see Wendell and Caleb Loveday come out of the store, both of em laughin and puttin on goofy faces. ‘Hey there, Mr Connor,’ Caleb managed between breaths. ‘I wouldn’t go in there less you wanna catch a dose of dumb.’ They both busted up again and peeled off up the street. I shook my head and hoped to God they’d trip in horseshit.</p>
<p>Dale was behind the counter when I entered. I nodded to him. ‘Dale.’ He nodded back and the fella he was servin looked round.</p>
<p>‘Mornin, Bill,’ Lloyd said.</p>
<p>‘Lloyd,’ I returned.</p>
<p>Dale mouthed my name over Lloyd’s shoulder. Couldn’t mouth the question mark that went along with it, but didn’t need to.</p>
<p>‘Good morning, Mr Connor.’</p>
<p>I turned around and saw Miss Garrett and Miss Everly fussin by a display of cookware. Spinsters and gossips the both. ‘Ladies.’ I touched the peak of my cap. Miss Garrett beckoned me over. I reluctantly obliged her.</p>
<p>‘Mr Connor,’ she said in a hush, ‘please tell us you are not on first name terms with that&#8230; blundering fool?’</p>
<p>I eyed the counter. ‘Oh, Dale’s not as nimble as he once was, but he’s no fool.’</p>
<p>‘I am referring, as you well know, to the town laughing stock, Lloyd Toomey.’</p>
<p>‘As you well know, Mizz Garrett, I do not dicker with the waggin tongues of this town.’</p>
<p>‘But you must have heard how Lloyd&#8217;s wife and best friend have been running around on him for over a year?’ Miss Everly said with a gleeful glint in her eye. ‘Why, it’s the standing joke of the town, that everyone knows about Joy Toomey and Joe Puddentane except for Lloyd.’</p>
<p>‘Love renders blind,’ I said, ‘and if you dusty bitches ever find it, feel free to differ with me.’ Hands followed gasps to gaping mouths. My wife might have disagreed, but sometimes my meanness is a gift.</p>
<p>I left the two gossip hounds to their devices, and joined Dale and Lloyd at the counter. ‘Didn’t notice your bicycle outside, Lloyd.’ I leaned heavy on the “Lloyd”.</p>
<p>‘Nope,’ Lloyd said. ‘Got me a sore ass ridin that thing all over. Thought I’d walk into town.’</p>
<p>Dale smiled and shook his head. ‘Say, Bill, perchance you can lend the boy the benefit of your considerable life experience. Lloyd here is fixin up his roof, but like I keep tellin him, he caint cut no lumber with no hacksaw.’</p>
<p>I eyed Lloyd’s imminent acquisition. ‘Dale’s correct on that score, Lloyd. Caint cut no lumber with no piddlin hacksaw. Fetch the boy a ripsaw for me, Dale.’</p>
<p>‘Caint afford no ripsaw,’ Lloyd said. ‘This here’ll do fine.’</p>
<p>‘The boy’s been in three times in two weeks,’ Dale said. ‘This here’ll be his third hacksaw. Coulda bought the king of ripsaws for the money he’s spent on hacksaws.’ Dale shook his head and ambled out to the back of the store.</p>
<p>‘Don’t fret on the cost, Lloyd,’ I said, and then, ‘Put it on my account, will you, Dale?’ I shouted out back.</p>
<p>‘That’s awful kind, Bill, but I’m goan need this here hacksaw anyhow. You see I’m fixin up the homestead for when Joy comes back. Make it nice for her.’</p>
<p>If Lloyd’s foolish grin was anything to go by, he was sure happy in his delusion. Couldn’t help but feel pleased for the boy. Sure beat ballin. ‘Put the hacksaw on the account, too, would ya?’ I said to Dale as he came out of the back with a brand new Cole &amp; Clayton rip. ‘And a couple quarts of whitewash while you&#8217;re at it.’</p>
<p>‘Now, Bill—’</p>
<p>‘Shut up, Lloyd. You want her back or dontcha?’</p>
<p>‘Well, sure, but—’</p>
<p>‘Good. Now go hump the whitewash onto the flatbed and get in the truck. Like this here old fool put it,’ I nodded at a smirkin Dale, ‘I’m goan give you the benefit of my considerable life experience.’ Lloyd went to open his mouth.</p>
<p>‘Lloyd,’ Dale said. ‘If a man like Bill Connor offers his hand, you take it.’</p>
<p>Lloyd shut his mouth and humped the whitewash to the flatbed.</p>
<p>‘Now don’t go lookin at me like that, Dale, you old codger.’</p>
<p>‘Going soft, Bill? Whatever would Alice have thought?’</p>
<p>‘Hell, I’ll help the boy fix his roof, but he can paint his damn house his own self.’</p>
<p>‘Yep,’ Dale said, raising his silvery brows. ‘Soft as shit.’</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>I drove back along the dirt road, past the farm and the Cooper place. Didn’t hear a peep out of Lloyd the whole way until he pointed out his place. ‘This un here. Thanks for the lift, Mr Connor.’</p>
<p>‘Looks like we’ll be needin that whitewash,’ I said, and got out of the truck.</p>
<p>It was a pretty lookin house in its ramshackle way, but stood lonely and set back from the dirt road, the Cooper place a dot in the distance. It seemed to say Don’t mind us, just walk on by. Me and Lloyd is doin fine without her. Just fine.</p>
<p>The flimsy porch railing was all splintered and bowed, and the timber siding had shed its skin of whatever paint it had once known and silvered long ago. The next time I was at Dale’s I would collect more paint; as small as it was, this old house would drink whitewash like a desert drinks rain.</p>
<p>‘Well, thanks again, Mr Connor,’ Lloyd said, settin the hacksaw and the Cole &amp; Clayton rip down on the porch. ‘You been real nice.’</p>
<p>I set the paint down next to the saws. ‘Thought I’d take a look at that roof for ya.’ I stepped onto the porch. ‘Point me out where the rain’s been gettin in and I’ll climb up there and take a gander.’</p>
<p>Lloyd backed up and stood in front of his screen door. ‘Hell, you don’t have to go to no trouble, Mr Connor.’</p>
<p>‘Now, Lloyd, just point me out where those leaks is gettin in and I won’t have to fix the whole damn roof but for a pin prick. And what’s with this Mr Connor shit? I told ya Bill is fine. Now come on, I can get you fixed up before the sun gets high.’</p>
<p>Lloyd took to chewin his lip and tuggin at his greasy mop. ‘Truth is, Mr Con— Bill, I aint been keepin up with my chores since Joy left me. I thank you again for your kindness, but I couldn’t have you step foot in there. It just wouldn’t be right.</p>
<p>‘Hell, Lloyd, after my wife passed it was two months before I pushed a broom in my place, let alone ate off a clean plate. If you think I have any womanly sensibilities about cleanliness, think again.’ I stepped by him as he jabbered somethin, and opened the screen door. When I opened the front door proper, the stench hit me like a spade to the face. He hadn’t been lyin about the chores.</p>
<p>I went straight over to the basin, which was heaving with filthy crockery, and opened the window to let the fresh air in and the stunk air out. It didn’t serve my nostrils any. I coulda puked from the smell, right there. Put me in mind of a time I came across one of my hogs over in the south field. Thing’d been dead awhile, and what flesh the foxes couldn’t eat, the flies had birthed young upon. Hellish.</p>
<p>‘I think we have ourselves a change of plan, Lloyd,’ I said, holdin my hand over my nose and mouth. I pointed at the floor with the other hand. ‘This here is not gonna win fair maiden from Prince Puddentane.’</p>
<p>Lloyd about-faced and burst out through the screen door. I heard him puke over the porch rail.</p>
<p>‘No shame in it, son,’ I called. ‘Hit a similar rock bottom when my wife passed. We’ll get you shipshape in no time. Fix the roof another. You got mop and bucket?’ Lloyd didn’t answer, so I began the search myself.</p>
<p>A sun-deprived hallway led off from the kitchen. Staircase on the left and two closed doors along and to the right. Behind the first door was a closet – a suitcase on the floor and a lady’s coat and hat hung from a peg on the wall. No mop and bucket. I opened the next door and found a small but well-kept reception room. Dusty, yes, but devoid of the ungodly stench.</p>
<p>I went back into the kitchen to ask Lloyd where Joy kept her cleaning detergents and such, and found him standing in the doorway sobbin quietly. He had a huntin rifle wedged in his hip. The barrel was aimed at me.</p>
<p>‘I caint let you go, Bill.’</p>
<p>‘Youngblood,’ I said. ‘I don’t know what in God’s name you talkin about, but point that thing away from me before somebody gets hurt.’ I moved towards him and he raised the rifle. I held up my hands. ‘Easy now, Lloyd.’</p>
<p>‘I know’d you know, Bill,’</p>
<p>‘Know what?’</p>
<p>Lloyd glanced up, and my eyes followed. On the ceiling above me was a dark stain with flies crawlin all over it. ‘Aw, shit,’ I said to myself, and met Lloyd’s gaze once again, tears and snot oozin out of him as he whimpered like a child.</p>
<p>‘I don’t want no lectric chair, Bill.’</p>
<p>‘Never met a man who did, Lloyd. Who’s up there, your best pal Joe Puddentane or Joy?’</p>
<p>‘I didn’t mean to do it,’ he said, shakin his head. Then his jaw muscles knotted. ‘But Joe made me so mad. When I got home, him and Joy was sittin over there…’ He nodded at the kitchen table, winced at some hellish recollection. ‘They’s holdin hands.’</p>
<p>‘That’s some tough watchin for any man,’ I said.</p>
<p>‘Uhuh.’ Lloyd sniffed and nodded. ‘Joe told me how him and Joy was in love and how they was movin to Bakersfield. Joy told me not to cry. I was always cryin, she said. Real men didn’t cry. I started cryin at that. She said to Joe, “Look at him, didn’t I say he was always cryin?”. Joe started laughin. He shouldna done that.’</p>
<p>‘Damn straight he shouldna.’</p>
<p>‘I took a swing at him, but Joe’s always been quicker’n me. He sat me on my ass before I know’d what’d hit me. From the floor I could see Joy’s suitcase under the table, the coat and hat I’d scrimped to buy her laid over it. Saw my gun in the corner, too. As Joe headed for the door with my wife, I crawled over to my gun, told him to stop right there. When Joe see me pointing this thing at him, he shoulda stopped. Instead he started laughin again. Joy, too. And then I could hear the whole town laughin with em. I always knew they’s cheatin on me, know’d it for almost a year, but I loved her so goddamn much, Bill. I’d share her if it meant keepin her. I’d be the town’s idiot if it meant keepin her.’ Lloyd sobbed, them bony shoulders of his hitchin like they did. ‘They made a coldblooded killer outta me – all of em: Joe, Joy, every snickerin sonbitch in this town.’</p>
<p>When Lloyd levelled the gun at my head at that moment, his face betrayed more pain and guilt than I have ever seen on a man. Other than my own reflection. ‘Now listen to me, Lloyd, and listen to me good…’</p>
<p>‘Turn around, Bill. I caint do it with you lookin at me.’</p>
<p>‘Now just hold on a minute,’ I shouted, but not through fear of death. My only fear was of dying before I could speak my last, because in Lloyd’s face I could see I would never leave this house. But I would tell what I had always meant to tell, even if it was to the man who would deal me death.</p>
<p>‘Make it quick, Bill.’</p>
<p>I took a deep one. ‘I think I told you my wife fell in the kitchen and died.’</p>
<p>‘You told me.’</p>
<p>‘Well,’ I said, ‘that is true, but she fell because I struck her. I struck my wife and killed her, Lloyd.’</p>
<p>‘Why… Why you tellin me this, Bill?’</p>
<p>‘Because somebody needed to know the truth before I died. Somebody needed to know the kind of man I was. My meanness. “Billy,” Alice used to squawk. “Billy, you never watch the sunset with me no more. Billy, you never pick me fresh flowers no more. Billy, you never buy me that nice brandy wine no more.” I lashed out. The only time I have ever raised a hand to that woman.’ I stared at my fists through a haze of tears and fading memory. ‘Some days I caint even remember what she looks like. I always said that would be the time to go. I forgot her while she was alive, but I would not in death. I caint have it.’ I blinked my eyes clear. Looked at Lloyd. Snot and tears running down his young face. Gun trembling in his hands. I turned my back to him. ‘You’re a good boy, Lloyd. I’m glad it’s you.’</p>
<p>‘I’m scared, Bill.’</p>
<p>‘The chair aint nothin to fear, Lloyd. Nor death. Bearing the burden of sin is the true test of men.’ I closed my eyes. ‘But it’s time to lay it down.’</p>
<p>I heard Lloyd step close and say, ‘I’m sorry, Bill.’ Then I heard the gun creak in his tightening fingers and I prayed for his trembling hands to be still. For his aim to be true.</p>
<p>It was.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>When I came to I was slumped up against the front wheel of my truck, the back of my head feelin like it’d been kissed with a branding iron. Afore me Lloyd’s place was ablaze. The dry timbers feedin hungrily the flames. I could feel the heat on my face and on the soles of my boots, and while I mulled over the idea of roastin right here in the dirt, I think I must have passed out again.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>A week later I was walkin in the north field. The hogs was gathered up by the fence and for just a second I thought it was Lloyd standin there. Sheriff Tindal always did cut a youthful figure for a man who’d seen as many winters as me.</p>
<p>‘Mornin, Bill.’</p>
<p>‘Otis.’</p>
<p>‘How’s the head.’</p>
<p>‘Mendin.’ I scratched at the crusty wound. ‘Take more’n a rifle butt to crack open this old block.’</p>
<p>Otis laughed, and then: ‘You was a lucky sonofabitch, let me tell ya. That kid had plumb lost his mental faculties, and he was a dumb sonofabitch to begin with.’</p>
<p>‘Kid was smarter than most of the folk in this town,’ I said. ‘Take my word on that.’</p>
<p>‘I beg to differ with you, Bill.’ Otis tipped his hat back and leant on the fence. ‘That dumb sonofabitch shot and kilt his wife and best friend Joe Puddentane, then set his place on fire and blew what little brains God gave him out the back of his dumb head. And if that wasn’t proof enough, instead of buryin the bodies, that dumb sonofabitch was hackin em up into iddy-biddy pieces. A course, didn’t get to make a start on his buddy, but hell, Bill, we could only find his wife’s head and feet. God only knows what the dumb sonofabitch did with the rest of her.’ Otis shook his head and looked down at Abby when she snuffled at his boots. ‘These hogs is gettin B, I, G, big. Please tell me you’re bleedin em soon, Bill. The whole town’s givin Butcher Carl a headache about that outta-town hog he’s been sellin. Folks is screamin for some Connor hog. Me included. Last year I had me some belly pork that damn near sent me to heaven. Sweetest thing I ever tasted.’ Otis leaned in and gave Abby a playful scrub of the head. ‘Hell, Bill, this here’n looks like she’s smilin.’</p>
<p>‘Yeah,’ I said. ‘Must think you somebody else.’</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Broke my heart to bleed Abby (she was never an eatin pig), but knowin that old gal as I did, she woulda eaten deeply of Lloyd’s cloth bag. I told Butcher Carl it was a taster of what was to come, and if he wanted to sell another snout of mine he should see to it that everybody in town got a piece before sundown. They’d earned it. Every last one of em.</p>
<p>That evenin I placed a fresh posy by Alice’s headstone and soaked the earth with a fine brandy wine. Alice never did like the sight of handguns, so I kept my Smith &amp; Wesson wrapped in its oilcloth by my side. In a little while we’d be watching the sunset together, and she could holler all she pleased.</p>
