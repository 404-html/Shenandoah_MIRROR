<p><strong>Hunting For Clues With Ghosts</strong></p>
<p>Rebecca Makkai’s novel <em>The Hundred-Year House</em> invites more than one reading. It may be finished in one long day on the beach, but this is no beach read; given the complex storyline, it requires commitment and patience from the reader. Its unconventional, inverted timeline means that Makkai provides the answers before her audience knows to ask the questions. In this treasure hunt of a book, a Marxist scholar, an unemployed broker, various artists, caretakers, and aristocrats shift their identities and perspectives, at the same time raising awareness of class issues, the subjectivity of what constitutes art, and domestic abuse.</p>
<p>The novel is presented in three sections, starting with the year 1999 and regressing first to 1955, then 1929, and terminating at the turn of the 20th century. The points of entry into the story narrow as well: beginning with the perspectives of multiple characters, by the end the reader has only a glimpse into the single narrator’s thoughts. Only the setting&#8211;an old-fashioned mansion on the edges of Chicago&#8211;stays somewhat constant while Makkai manipulates every other factor in an accelerated series of plot twists. Characters will unexpectedly disappear, die, betray one another, and change their faces before the reader’s very eyes, often simultaneously. It is a token to Makkai’s skill that so many key events can happen concurrently without muddying the understandability of the plot.<br />
The house begins and ends as the home of the Devohrs, an old-money family of Canadian aristocrats who “sat firmly in the second tier of great families of the last century,” with a brief phase as an artists’ colony. The ever-changing residents reveal their secrets in reverse; the fates that await the characters are introduced before the characters are, a risky, but well-executed, structural choice that makes reading the novel something like being handed the treasure and told to find the clues.</p>
<p>Despite its heavy reliance on concept, <em>The Hundred-Year House</em> has credible characters. Many are chameleons and some are simply con artists, but each insists on occupying multiple identities throughout the course of the story. The Marxist academic Zee, for instance, at the center of the first section, lives in her wealthy family’s carriage house in her mother’s estate. Meanwhile her husband Doug, supposedly trying to make an academic name for himself by writing about the obscure poetry of Edward Parfitt, a one-time occupant of the artists’ colony, secretly earns his salary from writing formulaic young adult novels. Doug’s predicament&#8211;“his stopover in the land of preteen fiction was only the latest in a wretched chain of events”&#8211;sums up the communal situation of every character who walks through the house. They have all found themselves in unlucky circumstances, by fault or by fate, and they’re trying desperately to claw their way out by “crawling out of [their] own skin.”</p>
<p>Those characters who remain exactly how they’re introduced are in fact the outliers against a host of people trying to be someone else. As the novel moves further back in time, the masks become more complicated, the lies less easily identifiable and their consequences more absurd. By the end of the first section, it is clear that no one is who they say they are, and everyone has ulterior motives.</p>
<p>However, the reader’s willingness to suspend disbelief with the eccentric, often irrational characters sometimes wears thin. Some of the characters’ decisions&#8211;for instance, changing one’s name multiple times over the course of a lifetime for the “fresh start”&#8211;lead the plot not to the impossible, but at least to the improbable. Part of the absurdity may be attributed to the fact that (in keeping with their generation) the characters in the first section are more like overgrown adolescents than adults. But the rest seems to exist solely so that Makkai can tie the dozens of threads throughout the story into a nice bow at the end. However, the reader can forgive her this. The answers to the mystery are so poetically justified that one can’t blame Makkai for her shortcuts.</p>
<p>The novel is a mystery, yes, but the author fulfills the promise made in the first paragraph: “For a ghost story, the tale of Violet Saville Devohr was vague and underwhelming.” That sentiment goes for the so-called haunted house as well. A number of mysterious nighttime bumps and shattering windows with origins unknown feature in the book, but although the reader waits patiently until the very end for the suicidal ghost to nudge the characters over the ledge of madness on which they all seem to be perched, the only spirit haunting the characters is excessive alcohol intake. The spooks are minor and never significantly handicap the believability of the story, yet are distracting enough to notice. Makkai’s half-hearted attempts to personify the house as somehow responsible for the destruction that occurs within its walls come off as unnecessary and slightly kitschy.</p>
<p>Perhaps <em>The Hundred-Year House</em>’s greatest strength is its satirical humor. Makkai pokes fun at her character’s attempts to fit themselves into various molds so subtly that an unobservant reader wouldn’t catch it, would in fact nod along in understanding to the very actions that Makkai mocks. As most of the characters are either academics or self-proclaimed artists (“We’re awfully lucky to do what we do,” declares one painter to her philistine benefactor)&#8211;each representing an institution that merits some satire or interrogation at least&#8211;there is an abundance of pretention and self-delusion ripe for ridicule. Even so, just like their real-life counterparts, the pompous professors and painters gluing garbage to canvas and calling it “art” aren’t unlovable. The reader may even feel affection toward them, like one might towards a toddler bent on becoming an astronaut. Makkai expertly paints her characters as slightly ridiculous, but not to such an extent that the reader dismisses them.</p>
<p>The first read can certainly be at times frustrating; without any inkling of what the treasure is, the reader may become irritated with the ever-growing pile of seemingly irrelevant clues. But Makkai does an admirable job creating a world appealing enough, and characters intriguing enough (although many are of the “love-to-hate” variety), that the reader will persevere anyway. And that’s a good thing, because when the treasure finally is uncovered, the reader will want to start the hunt all over again.</p>

		<title>WHITE OLEANDER by Janet Fitch</title>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by Liza Boldrick</p>
<p>There are two types of books: those which you can abandon for a day or two when things get hectic, and those which become temporarily fused to your fingertips, making the trip with you to the coffee maker, the gym, and narrowly avoiding a watery grave when you switch from showers to baths so you can keep reading without sacrificing hygiene. <em>White Oleander</em> by Janet Fitch falls squarely into the second category. But be warned: the novel’s magnetism comes not from a quick pace or easy humor, but rather a harrowing, heartbreaking plot&#8211;at times slow, but never boring&#8211;and a cast of characters who will make you alternately praise and question modern humanity, or as Fitch puts it, the “vastness of human suffering.”</p>
<p><em>White Oleander</em> tells the story of a reticent adolescent girl named Astrid who grows up first under the crushing, dazzling shadow of her larger-than-life poet mother, then in a motley array of various foster homes. It could be a classic coming-of-age story, except that Astrid is dragged through hell time and time again in a journey toward adulthood that isn’t “classic” in any sense of the word. Each new foster home brings a new universe for Astrid to try to mold herself into, with her mother attempting to play marionette master from prison, so that Astrid must continually re-learn how to survive in a world that feels no obligation for her protection. Fitch spares no painful detail as she moves through each home and Astrid’s increasingly toughened reactions, but the language is anything but rough. Fitch’s voice remains lyrical and stunning yet never loses its realism.</p>
<p>The poetry within the pain, perhaps, is the novel’s greatest strength. Expectedly, and realistically, Astrid hardens and becomes more cynical as a result of her trials. (It would be an insult to the reader’s intelligence to suggest otherwise.) Accompanying the quiet, initially faultless narrator on her journey can be painful, but Fitch rewards us by never abandoning Astrid’s softer side. Even in Astrid’s darkest circumstances&#8211;trying to survive in dank city foster homes overcrowded with violent, it’s-you-or-me street kids, grappling with authority figures using the foster system to unburden their own twisted psyches&#8211;Fitch manages to convey the darkness in beautiful and believable terms. Poetry is Astrid’s armor: “[Poems] have to become the marrow in your bones. Like fluoride in the water, they’ll make your soul impervious to the world’s soft decay.”</p>
<p>Astrid’s story is one of survival, but even more so of adaptation, and of molding what you’re given into something beautiful. After all, as Astrid’s mother says, “No one becomes an artist unless they have to.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robert Parham, who for many years has dedicated much of his life to his own poetry and to the poetry of others via his co-editorship (with James Smith) of the <em>Southern Poetry Review</em>, has in <em>The Relentlessness of Salvation</em> proven that the most radiant moments—when one “reaches / into the dark box / of the private universe,” one often finds the sources of “certain clarity.” This book, taken together, is elegiac in tone, but it does not preclude joy from emerging during the journey though the dark. Much of the collection focuses on relationships and the natural world, both motifs their own sources of possible darknesses, but Parham suggests that “two … drink / the darkness together, / its unquenchable length / also its most exquisite promise.”</p>
<p>Parham knows the importance of sound, but his aural acuity does not rob his voice’s believability—there are no sonic vortexes into which readers might fall, losing the center of the poems as they swirl through baroque ornamentations. Instead, there’s a kind of bluntness, a declarative tenor that blends well with Parham’s subtle sound devices, a confident and trustworthy marriage of manner and meaning. For instance, in “Because I Live in Savannah,” Parham’s facility is clear: “Perhaps it is the way the edge / on words wears smooth as if rubbed / against cobblestones near the river, / and the herons raise white questions . . . .”</p>
<p>Too, for a single collection of considerable heft at nearly one-hundred pages, I did not, as I often do, experience reader fatigue. The poems pivot sharply and quickly into each other, but as entities they remain distinct—nothing in the book blurs or repeats itself, even if Parham’s central concerns—the natural world, relationships, aging, identity, and place—ring consistently through <em>The Relentlessness of Salvation</em>.</p>
<p>In sum, these are great poems by a gifted writer, a writer that deserves to be known as much for his work as his editing. These poems evoke true wisdom. There is no glibness, no dull ironies. They are rare, openhearted poems; they have helped me navigate the pain life forces upon us. I am confident these poems will do the same for likeminded, sympathetic readers.</p>

<p><img class="alignright" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/641/files/2014/10/oldest-widow.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" align="right" />Recently “epic” has become a grossly misused word due to the trendiness of brash exaggeration. Reading <em>Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All</em> (Ivy Books), however, restores the meaning of an epic. Allan Gurganus’ monumental 875-page first novel chronicles the American Civil War era through the dynamic and unrestrained narration of Lucy Marsden, a self-described “veteran of the veteran.” Carried off at age 15 to wed a grizzled PTSD-plagued “Captain” Marsden, Lucy, a 99-year-old when the storytelling begins, unloads generations of tales both shattering and strange. She speaks not only for herself and her family, but also for her hometown, the fictional Falls, North Carolina (which Gurganus revisits in his newest novel<em> Local Souls</em>). She channels residents across the spectrum, from Lady, who would rather lurk as a ghost in the charred remains of her southern-belle past than confront the fallen South, to Castalia, a formidable slave-turned-entrepreneur who stares down the social barriers of the times. Despite the tragedies, Lucy does not summon the past with disdain or melancholy. Instead, she fights the darkness with levity, stating “he who laughs- lasts.”</p>
<p>Other war widows may have used their stories to teach morality or elicit wide-eyed sympathy, but not Lucy. We open the book to a chapter titled “Fight Song,” as Lucy introduces her mischievous nature to the reader and to the reporter, “-So, you come to pump me for my news before I got too little wind to spill news with? Well, as for secrets, I admit I am rich, child. That’s all the riches I got.” As we read on, we discover she is not the type to gloss over indecencies with a wilting sigh. For brutal encounters like her honeymoon night, she maintains a flippant tone and roasts the Captain’s performance concurrently as she describes her bleeding innards. But underneath all her sassiness, there is a deeper urge to articulate the madness of war and its shrapnel into home life. “[Telling stories] is more for them, my missing ones. If I should spill, it’s like… to represent them. They’d want it known, I reckon. Even the Captain would. Seems my family left me here to kind of keep their place. I’m one old parchment bookmark stuck right in the middle of a chapter where our particular group nodded off.”</p>
<p>Along with capturing the vibrancy of a storyteller’s diction, Gurganus draws special curiosity to the shifting meanings of colors. Lucy’s school assignment to interview a victim of “Our Struggle for Southern Independence” results in a story she titles “Black, White, and Lilac,” which examines how color meanings alter as social boundaries weaken. As Sherman’s march blazes down southward, color identity is warped, and the Marsdens’ former slaves are left to reinvent themselves. When Willie Marsden (not old or mad enough to have self-promoted) makes his journey north to atone for sins, he wanders dazed into an unnatural blue dye which has permeated the polluted waters of the industrializing North. Paralyzed by this color, he sees in the fish the faces of men killed in the war. “Swimming in place, they reverse to look up at the mill’s four smokestacks, dark towers billowing darkness, shooting flames, spreading a yellow soot that takes itself to be some golden future.” In “The Tribe That Answers,” Lucy takes on Castalia’s voice to paint Africa through lenses “green, mustardy and gray” to her soon-to-be-ex-mistress. The color red becomes a complex study, representing both holiness and death, as her tribe’s slave ship is painted the same color as their sacred bird.</p>
<p>This narrative swings from decade to decade, century to century, and anachronistic passages sometimes jostle the reader to reflect on current social issues. Right after Lucy details a chance encounter between the Captain and his war buddy, she gives a profound comparison of those who fought on the side that lost: the battered Confederate vets milling around the town square and the shell-shocked Vietnam veterans staring dead-eyed into a mall fountain. “These moping boys were not necessarily no geniuses before getting shipped to Asia (or Maryland). Maybe that’s why they were the ones that went. They grew up in churches, grew up being told: Freedom is worth saving, ladies and children first, standards, decency, rules, gentlemanly honor…. Then, shipped to the front, they were told: to preserve home standards and women and kids, they should bypass all they’ve been taught… this might mean hurting non-home women and kids and gents… The boys’ brain motors still worked, chugging hard to try and fit all this new stuff together, find a way of blending what seemed like opposites. But, once home, the brain rebelled… motor still goes but all circuits are blackened, fused. So as a vet, you sit in the middle of the Courthouse Square… or near the Mall fountain… You people-watch the shoppers, Americans you gave your all to save. You see them call their children away from your spot. You see they’re scared of what your saving them has done to you, guy.”</p>
<p>Gurganus’ Lucy has materialized into a comic sage through his acute diction and provided us a meticulous storyteller difficult to find today. Though, at times, Lucy Marsden’s one-line clinchers at the end of sections can sum up the story a bit too cheaply. Also, historical buffs will clench their teeth at Lucy/Castalia’s recounting of the journey over to America (the slave trade had ended long before she claimed to have been shipped over). Those hesitant to pick up this book due to its daunting length, however, should know that each story is easily defined and sectioned. So settle into your comfy chair and find out about “Simon’s Splendid Pocket Watch” or Lucy’s reason as to “Why I Say Ain’t.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reviewed by Philip Belcher</p>
<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/641/files/2014/09/goodbye.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-424" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/641/files/2014/09/goodbye.jpg" alt="goodbye" width="151" height="227" /></a>Winning the 2013 Isabella Gardner Poetry Award and the same year’s James Laughlin Award of the Academy of American Poets should be sufficient to recommend Jillian Weise’s <em>The Book of Goodbyes</em> to the reading public. Still, any book that compels a born and bred fan of the University of South Carolina to say something positive about Clemson University, which I hereby acknowledge had the wisdom to employ Weise in her current position of Assistant Professor, requires a more personal recommendation. I have not yet read Weise’s first two books, <em>The Amputee’s Guide to Sex</em> and her novel, <em>The Colony</em>, but I plan to now. <em>The Book of Goodbyes</em> is good enough that I want to read the work that preceded it.</p>
<p>A playwright as well as a poet, Weise organizes <em>The Book of Goodbyes</em> into two acts separated by an intermission and followed by the final section, “Curtain Call.” She employs a wry sense of humor—a very dark one—to explore in “Act One,” “Act Two,” and “Curtain Call” the complex emotional landscape of her speaker’s life as an amputee. Among poems addressing the speaker’s relationship with her lover, Big Logos, the poet directly addresses prejudice against people with physical disabilities in poems such as “The Ugly Law” and “Elegy for Zahra Baker.” Readers will find nothing here of political correctness. There is no suggestion that disabled means “differently abled.” Weise confronts readers head-on with the speaker’s own insecurities about sex, relationships, and fidelity; she does not mince words.</p>
<p>As engaging as these three sections of the volume are, however, the most exhilarating poems are the three in “Intermission,” the book’s second section. “Tiny and Courageous Finches” introduces the reader to two primary actors, Bitto and Marcel—finches who fly in and out of a cave behind a waterfall visited by tourists—and their love interests, the finches Lydia and Kate. In this poem and the two that follow, “Go On High Ship” and “Marcel Addresses Kate (As He Would If He Could),” Weise creates a world in which Marcel works on an “index of every time / a finch appears in print,” birds Skype to communicate, the finch embodiment of Wallace Stevens appears to deliver a monologue and sell insurance, and Kate reads the Surrealists. “Intermission” is a terrific sequence that does, indeed, provide an imaginative break in the volume, although I am convinced that additional readings will suggest subtle connections between this avian world and the dilemmas evident in the other poems in <em>The Book of Goodbyes.</em></p>
