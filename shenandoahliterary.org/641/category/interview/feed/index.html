								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Professor of Romance Languages Domnica Radulescu joined the Washington and Lee faculty in 1992. She has since taught courses on Italian Renaissance literature and French language and literature, and co-founded the Washington and Lee Women’s and Gender Studies Program. Aside from her teaching responsibilities, Professor Radulescu has been involved in (either written or helped edit) more than twenty scholarly articles and nine books or essay collections. She is perhaps best known for her two published novels, <em>Train to Trieste</em> (2008, published in twelve languages), and <em>Black Sea Twilight</em> (2010) and has just completed her third, <em>Country of Red Azaleas</em>, as well as her tenth scholarly book, <em>Theater of War and Exile from Eastern Europe and Israel</em>.  She&#8217;s moving towards books twelve and thirteen.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/domnica_radulescu_spot.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4203 aligncenter" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/domnica_radulescu_spot.jpg" alt="domnica_radulescu_spot" width="180" height="200" /></a>This deeply varied and impressive academic record reflects the diverse background that is Professor Radulescu’s early history. After fleeing Romania in 1983 as a political refugee, she received her Bachelor of Arts in English from Loyola University in Chicago along with both an M.A. in comparative literature and a Ph. D. in Romance languages and literatures from the University of Chicago. Her Eastern European background influenced her decision to address Eastern European women in her literature and to focus on theater in both French and Italian languages.</p>
<p>As evidence of both her talent and transnational stories, her first novel, <em>Train to Trieste</em>, has been translated into nine different languages and was the winner of the 2009 Library of Virginia Fiction Award. Professor Radulescu&#8217;s other accolades include winning the 2011 Outstanding Faculty Award from the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia (SCHEV). The award recognizes “superior accomplishments in teaching, research, and public service, ” and Professor Radulescu’s many accomplishments both as a professor and a writer certainly embody this standard.</p>

<p><em>Shenandoah</em>’s interview with Professor Radulescu highlights her experiences as a scholar and writer and offers a provoking insight into her masterful creations and understanding of multiple cultures.</p>
<p><em>Shenandoah</em>: How has the W&amp;L student body changed since you arrived on campus in 1992?</p>
<p>Domnica Radulescu: It has diversified more in terms of racial, ethnic and economic status categories. Compared to other schools Washington and Lee still has to make some important strides toward authentic diversification at all levels, but compared to itself it has opened up quite a bit since I first arrived on campus.</p>
<p>S: Your novels have been set across Europe and in the United States; I often hear that settings should be used as characters, having certain traits the complement the goal of the work. What traits might you say your Eastern European settings have? How do they differ from some traits of an American setting?</p>
<p>DR: I try to imbue my European settings with a sense of history and the magic of what is generally known as the old world.  I work at evoking settings in which nature and architecture complement each other, urban settings with touches of natural beauty as for instance a city street lined with fragrant linden trees and natural settings marked by the human touch and history as for instance a view of the brooding Carpathian Mountains with a medieval cathedral in the middle.  The European settings are in my flesh and blood as I grew up among them. The American settings are always surprising and fascinating to me as I keep discovering them and trying to appropriate them as my own. Since the American settings are viewed through the eyes and experience of immigrants they are harsher and edgier and often presented with both a sense of distance and nostalgia for the lost spaces of the characters.  Indeed often my settings are almost like characters in themselves and offer much more than the background for the unfolding of the action: they are interconnected with the life and the psychology of the characters, they offer refuge and are an intrinsic part of the action. For instance, the Carpathian Mountains offer refuge and consolation to the lovers in <em>Train to Trieste</em> as they are haunted by secret police and weighed down by an oppressive regime. The Black Sea becomes part of the action as the lovers in <em>Black Sea Twilight</em> rescue a French tourist from its tumultuous waves who in turn is going to have a crucial role in the unfolding of the plot.  The creation of a specific sense of place is fundamental to the creation of my novels.  Readers have often told me that they were transported to the spaces I was describing when reading my novels. I believe that means I am achieving at least one of the goals of my creative endeavors.</p>
<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/51KGHLpp6TL.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4204 alignleft" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/51KGHLpp6TL-200x300.jpg" alt="51KGHLpp6TL" width="200" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>S: How do you combine your studies of comparative linguistics with Women&#8217;s and Gender studies? How are your studies reflected in your writing?</p>
<p>DR: There is a continuous and fluid dialogue between my scholarly endeavors and my fictional work. For instance, in terms of comparative linguistics, my novels and plays display a wide range of linguistic registers from poetic to humorous to realistic to dreamy and they often play with language as well as integrate words and expressions from other languages. In terms of my experience with women&#8217;s and gender studies, my fictional works all portray strong female protagonists that own their destinies, tell their own stories, and have strong and memorable voices. They also illustrate the wide range of the female experience in the world from coming into oneself as a young woman to professional fulfillment or struggle, to creativity, to motherhood, sexuality, birth, friendship and female solidarity, aging, grief, and above all a larger than life laugh at the tragicomedy that is life.</p>
<p>S: To what extent does your study of languages affect your English writing style?</p>
<p>DR: Quite significantly.  I believe that because of my life long study and teaching of languages as well as due to the fact I write most of my fictional works in English, which is not my native language, I have a particular sensitivity to the nuances of words, to the sounds, rhythm  and music in language, to the ironies or poetry hidden in various combinations of words, to the great potential of language to transport us to mysterious worlds, to bring us to heights of joy or depths of sadness, or to incite us to action.  I believe that because I am an outsider to the English language I have the irreverent courage to play with the English language in ways that maybe native speakers would not have the willingness to do. I also often try to bring into my fiction the flavor of some of the other languages I speak and love: some of the earthiness and humor of my native language Romanian, some of the sexy lyricism of French, some of the delicious melodiousness of Italian.  The English language is a generous language that has great potential and powers and is a Protean language with great potential for transformation and playfulness.</p>
<p>S: Can you outline several differences in your process in writing a play as opposed to a novel?</p>
<p>DR: For me, writing a novel is like building a house: you have to create a foundation, walls and structures that hold it together, windows that are open onto the world and make sure that all the parts are interconnected so that the house doesn’t fall down. Characters, plot development, details of place, time, atmosphere, geography, psychology, philosophical ideas all have to be tied in an architecture that makes sense and is cohesive as is aesthetically engaging. Sometimes it is agonizing and despairing, and things do crumble and then you have to go back and rebuild parts, dismantle others, until it all holds in a seamless yet delicate balance.  Writing a play for me is, on the contrary like playing with blocks, it is very much the opposite of writing a novel:  playful, light even when the themes or ideas may be difficult or the characters poised on the line between the tragic and the comic, and it gives me a great sense of creative freedom. I can make the most outrageous structures with my colored blocks which are words and images. The fact that I can allow the characters to talk in their own voices, act and play often in wildly contrasting ways, confront one another or reflect one another gives me the sense of a magical world that has a life of its own.</p>
<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/8593763.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4205" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/8593763-192x300.jpg" alt="8593763" width="192" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>S: Having described some of those differences, is there a genre that you prefer, or does your choice depend on subject matter? Or on something else?</p>
<p>DR: I like each of them equally but in different ways.  I am basically a story teller, and I love telling a good story and building a beautiful house for it.  The narrative genre gives me the sense of great power. James Joyce said that the narrator is “like God in creation.” There is something true about that and the sense of a certain omnipotence of creating a cohesive and functioning world is exhilarating. On the other hand, I have worked in the theater for my entire adult life, either as actor, director, teacher or scholar of theater and I believe I have a sense of timing, voice, contrast and tension which is at the core of theater. I feel great freedom in the writing of a play as I give voice to a wide array of points of view and personalities. I feel I can experiment and there is no limit to how far I can take my imagination in the creation of a play. In writing a novel I feel I have to perform a balancing act between delving inside my creative imagination and reigning it in so that the story can shine through.</p>
<p>S: After having lived in the US for so long, do you identify with American culture? With Washington and Lee culture?</p>
<p>DR: I identify and appreciate many aspects of American culture as America is my home. I appreciate its sense of openness, wildness and freedom, its great human diversity, American humor and the puzzling balance between fierce individualism and the working of communities, its wide expanses of land, its music, and its highways.</p>
<p>There are aspects of Washington and Lee culture that I identify with and others that I don&#8217;t.  I appreciate some aspects of its developing artistic and intellectual culture, and its slowly growing counterculture, small as that may be.  I do not identify with or appreciate the Greek culture, the masculinist culture or the cult of Robert E. Lee.  The last one in particular is very alien and alienating to me.  I do feel quite close to the students taken individually, and I appreciate the university&#8217;s many resources.  I love the view of the town seen from the Colonnade at sunset.</p>
<p>S: <em>Shenandoah</em> has made a complete transition to an online format. How do you think that changes the way the published pieces are read and perceived?</p>
<p>DR: Just as anything else that is changing from paper format to electronic: something is to be gained and something is lost: that which is gained in accessibility and circulation is lost in the precious physicality of the paper object.  Some people still think that electronic journals are less prestigious but more and more important publications have either moved to or started as electronic journal in the first place. In a way the electronic format offers more freedom in layout, illustrations and its success depends how the journal is being publicized and connected to various sources online. I personally find it sort of fun and really convenient to read journals online while I still love holding a real book in my hands.</p>
<p>S: You’ve incorporated both autobiographical and fictional elements into your works; how do you avoid injecting too much of yourself into the characters? How do you ensure they are separate entities rather than reflections of yourself?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/naturalized_women_poster.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4206 aligncenter" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/naturalized_women_poster-231x300.jpg" alt="naturalized_women_poster" width="231" height="300" /></a>DR: I don’t really and I don’t worry about it. There is always an organic integration of my personal experiences with my imagination, research and other peoples’ stories into a holistic entity.  To me art is an awakening or it leads to an awakening.  In order for that awakening to happen it needs to emerge from the depths of the artist’s experience, soul, creative imagination and then the material or the story that emerges from those places needs to be transformed in the furnace of that imagination into a work that others can connect to, identify with or be moved by. Whether a work is autobiographical or not, or somewhat autobiographical and somewhat fictional, whether it is “a true story” or not, is irrelevant to me. What is relevant to me is that a reader who picks up one of my novels discovers something in it that she/he can connect with at a deep level, that she/he experiences that awakening and discovers something new about the world, the human condition and themselves. Then it is a true story.</p>
<p>S: If you had to choose one language in which to read, which would you choose?</p>
<p>DR: I wouldn’t.  I don’t want to make that choice, because I love to read in many languages and discover the various universes of thought that are contained in those languages: French, English, Italian, Romanian, or Spanish.  But if let’s say I was forced to choose only one language to read in I think it would be English. But I would really miss the other languages and probably translate in my mind into one of the other languages I love as I went on with the reading in English.</p>

<p><b>F</b>rom her studio in downtown Bristol, Virgina-based artist Suzanne Stryk creates work that offers a thought-provoking look at the ways humans understand the natural world.  In the following interview, Stryk offers her thoughts and explanations on the inspiration behind her own work, her favorite Virginia landmarks, and the marriage between art and science.</p>
<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/632/files/2014/03/Suzanne_Stryk_1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-569 alignright" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/632/files/2014/03/Suzanne_Stryk_1.jpg" alt="Suzanne_Stryk_1" width="200" height="134" /></a></p>
<p>“Like the enigmatic Rosetta Stone, Stryk&#8217;s beautiful mixed media panels invite close investigation, beckoning decipherment of a personal iconography . . . . She is as much a sculptor as a painter, teasing fibers from a bird&#8217;s nest to render them tactile or scratching notations into her gesso that are part science, part poetry, and all obsession.” Leah Stoddard, Director Second Street Gallery, Charlottesville, VA</p>
<p>“Although the work raises questions about diversity and extinction, the artist remains a mute, studious observer. But Stryk also engages in fanciful still-life constructions . . . these gently startling manipulations recall the subdued surrealism of Max Ernst . .  ..” Susan W. Knowles, <em>Art Papers</em></p>
<p>“Stryk&#8217;s show at the Fernbank Museum of Natural History, &#8220;The Collector&#8217;s Confession,&#8221; suggests the dialogue between art and science that goes on in the mind of most collectors of natural objects . . . .” Jerry Collum,<i> Atlanta Journal Constitution</i></p>
<p><strong>SHENANDOAH: We&#8217;ve noticed that one of your primary focuses in your work is birds. Is there a particular reason for this?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SUZANNE STRYK</strong>: Well, watching birds as a child was the moment my heart first opened to the natural world.  It might be that I’m always striving to recapture that sensation in my art.</p>
<p>But, you know, my bird imagery — wings, eggs, feathers, nests, along with the bird image itself — suggests <i>both</i> avian life and human analogies.  Take the nest.  I have a quote tacked onto my studio wall by the French philosopher Gaston Bachelard: “A nest is a precarious thing, yet it sets us to daydreaming about security.”  I tap into this paradox with my nest images.  Which is to say they’re 100% about nests and 100% about how we interpret them.</p>
<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/632/files/2014/03/1_Vacancies.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-570" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/632/files/2014/03/1_Vacancies-300x113.jpg" alt="1_Vacancies" width="426" height="160" /></a></p>
<p>“Vacancies”</p>
<p><strong>SHENANDOAH: Do you have a favorite type of bird?</strong></p>
<p><strong>STRYK</strong>: Favorite bird?  Hmmm, that’s a hard one.  Because it probably changes with each day, or even hour!  Certainly one of my favorites is the wood thrush.  And you know I rarely see them, only hear their flute-like song from the forest canopy above my house.  They appear one day in the spring — leave again in the late summer for South America.  Can you imagine that such a delicate bird migrates so far?  Up close, thrush feathers are astonishing — all those ivories, browns, and rusty spots.</p>
<p><strong>SHENANDOAH: It&#8217;s refreshing to see such natural images in your artwork. Why do you focus only on the natural world and avoid human subjects and manmade objects?</strong></p>
<p><strong>STRYK</strong>: It only seems that I avoid human subjects and manmade objects.  My art work <i>itself</i> is manmade, and the subject of my work is not the natural world, alone, but how we humans look at the natural world. There’s a difference.  I’m not painting what animals naturally look like in their habitat.  Take for example my painting “Five Ways of Looking at a Goldfinch.”  You see the spontaneous sketch of the bird, the detailed painted bird, the shadow of the bird, the genome of the bird, and a vortex painted with the colors of the goldfinch.  And where’s the real finch?  Not there.  The goldfinch itself, its presence, is elusive.  The five ways of seeing the bird are subjective <i>interpretations</i>.  Do you follow what I’m saying?  We could sequence its entire genome or precisely paint it, but goldfinch-ness remains a mystery.  Yet our <i>attempt </i>to understand — that’s amazing!</p>
<div id="attachment_572" style="width: 305px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/632/files/2014/03/3_Five-Ways-of-Looking-at-a-Goldfinch.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-572" class="wp-image-572 size-medium" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/632/files/2014/03/3_Five-Ways-of-Looking-at-a-Goldfinch-295x300.jpg" alt="3_Five Ways of Looking at a Goldfinch" width="295" height="300" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-572" class="wp-caption-text">“Five Ways of Looking at a Goldfinch”</p></div>
<p><strong>SHENANDOAH: People usually view art and science as very separate fields.  How do you see them coming together, and why do you think that this synthesis is important?</strong></p>
<p><strong>STRYK</strong>: You know, every day scientists discover more amazing facts about the natural world.   But from that objective scientific data artists can create myth or reveal mystery.  From sheer biological information artists might see symbolic truths about life, or uncertainty, or wonder.  Artistic interpretations of science, in other words, return the natural world back into the human imagination.</p>
<p>And the synthesis of science and art is all the more important in our age.  The way I see it, the underlying reason for environmental problems — climate change, mountain top removal, slaughter of endangered animals — is because nature’s been objectified into a monetary value.  You know what I just said about science revealing amazing facts and art’s capacity to bring those facts into the human imagination?  They’re <i>both</i> essential to protect nature from being reduced to dollars.</p>
<p><strong>SHENANDOAH: Have you always been passionate about art and science?  </strong></p>
<p><strong>STRYK</strong>: Yes.  Marrying those two have been my mission in life.  I may have many doubts, but why we’re here is not one of them.  We’re here to witness the whole array of life on this planet, including what our own species gets up to — which may be wonderful, or might be quite disturbing and destructive.  We’re here to shout “hallelujah, amen,” or “damn” and “amen” again, about what we observe happening on this planet we inhabit.</p>
<p><strong>SHENANDOAH: When did you first define yourself as an artist?</strong></p>
<p><strong>STRYK</strong>: When on my first federal income tax form I wrote “artist” for the occupation!  No really, that’s a hard question to answer.  Probably when I was a naive art student in the early 70s it was easier to call myself an artist.  That is, before I knew what it took to develop personal voice, or sustain visual and conceptual ideas.   Later, I became more fully aware of the difficulty of mastering not only materials and techniques, but also the challenge of exploring ideas deeply enough to be sustained.   And when learning more about the rich accomplishment of artists in the past, I became more reluctant to call myself an “artist.”  It seemed a title that claimed some kind of inspired authority.  Let others determine that.</p>
<p>Just a little aside, here.  You might find it funny, but one reason I like living in blue-collar Bristol is that when I walk to my downtown studio I’m surrounded by all sorts of workers: shop owners, business people, office managers, city workers, hairdressers, and so on, and feel just one of them.  I’m working at my task just as they are.  In my daily life, I truly consider myself a worker.  A maker of images.</p>
<p><strong>SHENANDOAH: Is there any moment or event that occurred in your life that pushed you towards your pursuit of art?  </strong></p>
<p><strong>STRYK:</strong> There was such a moment when I worked as a scientific illustrator in the early 80s.  It happened in my windowless lab room, drawing a snapping turtle skull on the stainless steel counter.   I was sucked into its eye sockets as I drew, wondered how <i>it</i> once saw the world from the muddy bottom of a pond.  I was struck by the limitations of my careful drawing, of what it missed about the dark primeval creature’s life.  You know, there were certain things I loved about scientific illustration.  The process is remarkably egoless and intense — I liked that.  But I knew then it would never entirely fulfill my desire to explore the mysteries beneath the surface of the natural world.</p>
<p><strong>SHENANDOAH: Could you explain more about your series of Thomas Jefferson- inspired pieces?  What about the ecologically distinct regions of Virginia inspire you?   Did you have a favorite region to paint?</strong></p>
<p><strong>STRYK:</strong> Jefferson’s book <i>Notes on the State of Virginia</i> was the springboard for my own artistic exploration of the state.  While I began by visiting his old haunts, such as Natural Bridge, most of the pieces in my series are about places of my own choosing.  I could say so much about this work!  I recommend that interested readers watch an 8-minute video uploaded on You Tube by the Taubman Museum of Art, where my “Notes on the State of Virginia” series was first shown last summer.  That’ll give a better sense of it than what I could do here quickly. [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wc3StD99X-g">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wc3StD99X-g</a>]</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wc3StD99X-g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>But in response to your question, art for me is a way of experiencing the world, not only creating a final product.  So setting out to discover my home state was a self-created mission to engage more intensely with the land and its people.  For an example, let’s take the piece I did on Appomattox.  Because the Civil War looms so large in Virginian culture and because I’m a Northerner come South, I chose that battlefield out of all others.  While there, I sketched, took notes, walked across dry fields in the summer sun, collected black locust and oak leaves, talked to a landscaper planting indigenous trees, and sketched unearthed civil war artifacts.  And soon I began feeling how the bloody event that once occurred on the now-peaceful land still had a power over its people.  Then I thought about how those rusty artifacts — the lost scissors of a soldier, a stray bullet, the button and the medal — held a historical human story along side the living present.  So my task back at the studio was to merge those moving human memories with the natural history of that Virginian landscape.</p>
<p>Every piece in my “Notes on the State of Virginia” series documents a similar path from site visit to studio.  At Natural Bridge I observed a swallow swooping in and out of the stone arch.  Thinking that the bird was genetically related to the swallow Jefferson might have seen there, I made the bridge out of swallow genomes.</p>

<p><strong>SHENANDOAH: Where does your artistic inspiration come from?  Do you have a specific time of day or spot that you like to paint? </strong></p>
<p><strong>STRYK:</strong> I think what inspires me most is the possibility I might create something I’ve never seen before.  Something spurred by what surprises me in my daily observation of the natural world.</p>
<p>Time of day I prefer?  Well, I’m a morning person, but I work at all times of day, despite that preference.  Because I believe it’s professional to work even when not in the mood — in fact, work itself can kindle the right mood.</p>
<p>Place?  I have a small studio at home where I work on intimate, small-scale pieces, and a larger space on the third floor of an old building in downtown Bristol, with high walls, for painting larger work.</p>
<div id="attachment_576" style="width: 378px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/632/files/2014/03/7_studio.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-576" class="wp-image-576" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/632/files/2014/03/7_studio-300x225.jpg" alt="7_studio" width="368" height="275" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-576" class="wp-caption-text">Downtown Bristol studio</p></div>
<p><strong>SHENANDOAH: Who is your favorite artist?  Do you draw inspiration from any specific movement or artists? </strong></p>
<p><strong>STRYK:</strong> The artist who immediately comes to mind is Pieter Brueghel, the 16<sup>th</sup>-century Flemish painter.  I love the depth of his colors, his rich umbers . . .   his muted blue-greens . . . his delicate touch combined with the strong physical presence of his paintings.  Particularly interesting to me are Brueghel’s later works, such as “Magpie on the Gallows” or “Landscape with the Fall of Icarus.”  These works convey the smallness of the human story within the larger context of nature, a concept called the “theater of the world” in Brueghel’s day.</p>
<p>Regarding inspiration from other artists . . . well, I quite <i>literally </i>draw from other artist’s work.  Let me explain.  When I’m visiting an art museum, I bring my sketchbook along, just as I might out in the field.  Then when I’m struck by an image — often a detail in a painting — I make a sketch with notes beside it.  Not always, but mostly I’m drawn to images from the natural world.</p>

<p><strong>SHENANDOAH: Do you have a favorite written work?</strong></p>
<p><strong>STRYK:</strong> I’m not sure I can list a <i>single</i> favorite, but could answer the question how literature has affected my work as a visual artist.</p>
<p>There are two books that strongly influenced my world view.  One is<i> The Wonders of Life on Earth,</i> a huge book my parents bought in the 50s before I was old enough to read. Its lavish illustrations of everything from iguanas to egrets served me then like the paintings on cathedral walls did for the illiterate in the middle ages.  Later, in high school Loren Eiseley’s book <i>The Immense Journey</i> was life changing.  I absorbed its message hook, line and sinker.  And that message in a nutshell is about the unique human potential to witness other lives on the planet.</p>
<p>And more recently?  Well, there are a few prose pieces and poems I read again and again.  One is Pattiann Rogers’ poem about animals and people, “The Human Heart in Conflict With Itself.”  It’s a comprehensive litany about our relationship with furry, feathered, scaly, or chitenous other worlds.  And importantly, visual art and poetry are part of the fabric of my daily life with my husband, the poet Dan Stryk.</p>
<p><strong>SHENANDOAH: We love your mirror works. Can you explain what inspired you to create them, or perhaps give us some insight into your purpose behind them? </strong></p>
<p><strong>STRYK:</strong> I’m happy to hear you respond to the mirror works, since they’re what I’m working on right now.  To create them, I remove part of the silver from the back of the mirror so it remains partially reflective yet also reveals something of what’s behind the glass.  I paint on top of the mirror.  Then under the mirror I place painted images, sometimes genome sequences or book pages, or maybe sheet music yellowed with age.  The whole thing creates a diversely layered effect.  Then one more layer is created when the viewer stands before it and sees his or her reflection.  The pieces also change with the light, or with whatever environment they’re reflecting.  It reminds me of what Heraclitus’ said about not stepping in the same river twice.  My mirror works are always changing with how they’re being observed, always in flux.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>     BORN IN UPSTATE</strong> New York, Jon Clinch graduated from Syracuse University in 1976. The same year, he married Wendy Harris, and began his career as a high school English teacher in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. The couple has one daughter named Emily, and they currently live in the mountains of Vermont. Clinch taught for three years until he switched to the advertising world, working as a copywriter and creative director until 2007. The following year, in 2008, his first novel <em>Finn</em> was published by Random House  and was named an American Library Association Notable Book, won the Philadelphia Athenaeum Literary Award, and was shortlisted for the Sargent First Novel Prize. Two years later, Clinch published his second novel,<em> Kings of the Earth</em>. He recently released his third novel, <em>The Thief of Auschwitz</em>.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Shenandoah</span>:</strong>  How would you describe your life as a writer?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Jon Clinch</span>:</strong>  As for my life as a writer, it&#8217;s quiet and methodical. I write at least five days a week, about six hours a day, with a goal of producing somewhere around 1,200 words. Unlike many of my fellow writers, I didn&#8217;t come up though the MFA system; therefore I don&#8217;t teach much and generally keep to myself. My life as an advertising writer taught me not to wait for inspiration, but to sit down in front of the keyboard and get the work done on a regular and methodical basis.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">S</span><strong>:</strong>  Mark Twain once said, &#8220;A ship is safe in harbor, but that is not what ships are for.&#8221; Do you feel that writers in the university can be like ships in harbors?<img class="size-full wp-image-4144 alignleft" style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/jonclinch-2.jpg" alt="jonclinch 2" width="370" height="269" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">JC</span>:</strong>  I certainly don&#8217;t blame folks for seeking out a secure situation, and God knows that the more serious you are as a writer the less likely you are to earn a living at it.</p>
<p>That said, there&#8217;s no question in my mind that advanced writing programs produce a flattening of both style and content. Only certain subjects are fit for writing about, and only certain creative methods are worthy of pursuit. Those are both, of course, bad things that limit artistic expression instead of enhancing it.</p>
<p>These programs can be mightily incestuous, too. Here&#8217;s an example. Shortly after <em>Finn</em> arrived, with its many rave reviews and its place on several papers&#8217; lists of best books and its various awards, I wrote the folks at Breadloaf (in my back yard here in Vermont) to see if I might be able to drop by sometime during the summer for a reading or some such. They invited me to submit some samples of my work, with the aim that if I proved worthy I might be invited to enroll in the program as a student. Needless to say, I let it drop.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-4142 aligncenter" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-31-at-10.45.27-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-03-31 at 10.45.27 AM" width="600" height="50" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">S</span>:</strong>  Where did you get your inspiration for Finn?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">JC</span>:</strong>  I first read <em>The</em> <em>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em> when I was eight or ten years old, and I was memorably terrified by the dead man in the house that comes floating down the Mississippi in Chapter 9. Reading the book many times as an adult, it seemed to me that the scene’s place in the novel (just where Huck and Jim’s story starts taking off) conspires with the dead man&#8217;s anonymity (the corpse isn’t identified as Finn’s until the end of the book) to keep readers from giving it too much serious attention. No doubt plenty of people slide right past the details: the markings on the walls and the calico dresses, the black cloth masks and the child&#8217;s speckled straw hat, the baby bottle and the wooden leg. There was an adventure getting started, after all, and this mysterious scene—populated as it was only by an unidentified corpse—was just one more picaresque detail.</p>
<p>The more I thought about the whole business, the more I wondered how Finn had come to die surrounded by those mysterious artifacts. The conventional wisdom—that the floating house was a brothel—didn&#8217;t wash. I preferred to believe that Twain had left in that crowded room a set of clues—not just to Finn&#8217;s death but to his life. In writing <em>Finn</em>, I set out to follow those clues wherever they led.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">S</span>: </strong> Where did you find resistance to or encouragement of your work?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">JC</span>:</strong>  At the outset, a famous novelist warned me that if I insisted on writing <em>Finn</em> I ought to be constantly on my guard. “Mr. Clemens,” he said, “will be looking over your shoulder.”</p>
<p>He didn’t know the half of it. And frankly, neither did I. Only when I showed early bits of the manuscript to other writers did I begin to understand. There was plenty of encouragement, of course, and lots of praise, but beneath it all was an undercurrent of “How dare you?”</p>
<p>Funny thing is, it had never occurred to me that writing a novel about Huck Finn’s father was all that daring. Plenty of other folks have spun out metafictions involving characters from other people&#8217;s books—my long-time favorite being John Gardner&#8217;s <em>Grendel</em>. (To tell the whole truth, <em>Grendel</em> inspired <em>Finn</em> as much as anything. Gardner retold <em>Beowulf</em> from the monster&#8217;s point of view, and that&#8217;s pretty much what I set out to do for Huckleberry Finn.)</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">S</span>:</strong>  What was your process like in writing <em>Finn</em>?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">JC</span>:</strong>  My process was pretty much what it always is—a methodical grinding out of text for hours at a time. I&#8217;m a great believer in the power of steady work, and writing <em>Finn</em> was no exception. I was working full-time in advertising in those days, and by writing both before and after work I was able to put something five or six hours a day into the manuscript.</p>
<p>When people learn that I wrote <em>Finn</em> in only five and a half months, I remind them that although it’s not much time to be writing a serious novel, it’s a long stretch to be nursing a serious illness. Which is pretty much what writing <em>Finn</em> was like: a violent, feverish dream that I could escape only by surrendering myself to it entirely. Finn’s story and his world took over my life, and I believe that a good amount of that strange intensity remains upon the page.</p>
<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1296600620Finn.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4145 aligncenter" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1296600620Finn.jpg" alt="1296600620Finn" width="900" height="130" /></a></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">S</span>:</strong>  Did you do research on the early 19th century other than reading Huckleberry Finn?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">JC</span>:</strong>  Once I had the idea for <em>Finn</em>, I re-read the first nine chapters of Huck and jumped right in. I re-read Life on the Mississippi as I worked just to provide some context, but that was pretty much all I did in terms of research. My intent was always to honor the imaginative world that Twain created in Huck Finn rather than enslave myself to the details of geography or history. Some scenes from Huck replay whole in Finn, except for point of view and subtext. Some scenes that Twain only sketched or suggested—Finn and the professor from Ohio, Finn and Judge Stone—are fleshed out fully. Other scenes that my narrative required—Finn’s discovery of Huck’s escape from the squatter’s shack, for example—called for interpreting the events of Huck in new ways. And Twain’s decision to have a child tell his own story gave me the freedom to consider Huck an unreliable narrator, particularly when it came to describing the wickedness of his own father.</p>
<p>William Faulkner was another inspiration, obviously. I’d always wanted to write a novel with a powerful motivating character who remained just behind the scenes, like Thomas Sutpen in <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> The Judge fills that role in <em>Finn</em>, although as draft turned into draft he moved more and more out of the shadows. Herman Melville was a great inspiration, too. The Santo Domingo sequence where Finn abducts Mary is in some ways a retelling of his novel<em> Benito Cereno</em>. Then there’s music. Many rhythms and phrases and references in <em>Finn</em> come from the magnificent Gospel hymns of Fanny Crosby, Charles Albert Tindley, and others. I came to love these as a child, and they stay with me to this day. Other musical touchstones are the fine banjo-and-fiddle recordings of John Hartford and Texas Shorty, whose plaintive and stately melodies form the secret soundtrack of this book.</p>
<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/pap-jpg.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4194 aligncenter" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/pap-jpg-189x300.jpg" alt="pap-jpg" width="189" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">S</span>:</strong>  What are the upsides and downsides of creating work based upon previously created characters?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">JC</span>:</strong>  The upside is that they arrive in your manuscript fully imagined. The downside is that even though they come that way, other readers may have fleshed them out in their minds differently than you did. So you still have plenty of convincing to do — perhaps more convincing than you have when you start from scratch. Everything that any borrowed character does must be consistent with his appearance in the original text, and yet everything must also extend what&#8217;s gone before—building upon a network of elements over which you had no control. That&#8217;s probably the toughest part. But I always enjoy operating against a set of constraints, so it&#8217;s OK with me.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">S</span>:</strong>  This question comes from our editor Rod Smith, and he asks if you intentionally played around with language in the novel. There are many times where you are playful with language, such as &#8220;cutting the two in twain.&#8221; Pap Finn also primarily goes by Finn&#8211;Twain gives us that name but you put the character by the water, in the water, or drinking whiskey like water. Were you trying to be constructive or fun with this? What about biblical undertones for this character? Matthew 4:19 reads &#8220;Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.&#8221; Is Finn a spinoff of a Christ figure? How have readers responded to this?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">JC</span>:</strong>  <em>Finn</em> is definitely saturated with biblical imagery and language. There may be too much of it to make any kind of final sense of, to tell the truth. Big stuff and small stuff and everything in between. Mary&#8217;s name, for heaven&#8217;s sake. Which would make Huck&#8230;well, you know. &#8220;Unto us a child is born.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sparks that whirl up from Bliss&#8217;s fire when we first meet the bootlegger echo the Book of Job, where we learn that man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward.</p>
<p>All of the references to sacrifice and sacrament and mystery. Even in the worst and most violent moments, I tried to maintain an atmosphere of something that we might call holiness. Whether or not I succeeded is another issue.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">S</span>:</strong>  Where do you believe religion to lie in the text? The whitewashed markings on Finn&#8217;s bedroom wall are extremely powerful, as well as religious images. Do you believe that the markings on the wall could act as a map of the novel?</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">JC</span>:</strong>  Religion is everywhere in the book. I hadn&#8217;t thought about it, but the markings on the wall are definitely a map of the narrative. They&#8217;re Finn&#8217;s primarily non-verbal confession, so they pretty much tell his story.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">S</span>:</strong>  Who do you believe to be the most evil character in the story?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">JC</span>:</strong>  That&#8217;s a tough one. The Preacher, probably, for the absolutely appalling things he does during the short time he&#8217;s on stage in the book. That&#8217;s probably a tribute to Twain&#8217;s artistry in creating the King, who was his model, as an individual who troubles me a good deal whenever I encounter him.<br />
On the other hand, I could readily make a case for the Judge. So could Finn, I&#8217;ll bet.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">S</span>:</strong>  Finn has some moments of grace but ultimately cannot sustain them, like in his relationship with Mary for example. To what degree is the reader supposed to pity Finn?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">JC</span>:</strong>  I root for Finn on every page, wishing that he had even the slightest chance of making something decent of himself. I hope that readers feel the same way, in spite of themselves.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">S</span>:</strong>  What do you expect the reader of Finn to experience if they have not read Huckleberry Finn or Twain&#8217;s other work?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">JC</span>:</strong>  With any luck, they&#8217;ll understand it entirely and need no further context. I really did strive to make it a freestanding piece of work that anyone with a little basic knowledge of American history would be able to appreciate and follow.</p>
<p>In some measure, particularly when divorced from Huck, it&#8217;s actually something of a page-turning thriller.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I buried a zillion small things in the book that serve as rewards for the reader who comes to it with a real knowledge of Huck. Phrases, scenes, cameo appearances, themes, motifs&#8230;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">S</span>:</strong>  What is your latest project/ what are you currently working on now?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">JC</span>:</strong>  I&#8217;m writing a novel that&#8217;s much like<em> Finn</em>, very dark and very dense and very tragic. It&#8217;s about two remarkable families that lived during the nineteenth century in the county where I grew up: the Oneida Community, which was a repressive utopian organization founded on free love; and the Loomis Gang, which was the nation&#8217;s most notorious crime family.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #008000;">Praise for <em>Finn</em>:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>“Clinch reimagines Finn in a strikingly original way, replacing Huck’s voice with his own magisterial vision—one that’s nothing short of revelatory.” –</strong><i><strong>The Washington Post Book World</strong> </i></span></p>
<p><strong>“Remarkably honest… Clinch admits the distance between that which we know and that which we dare acknowledge of the human condition, and that which we can only shudder to imagine.” –<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><i> </i>“A decidedly dark and especially compelling read… With a keen eye and character detail and an uncanny gift for storytelling, the author has invented an outstanding tale that stands up and walks around on its own—out of the shadow of Mark Twain’s masterpiece.” –<i>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</i></strong></span></p>
