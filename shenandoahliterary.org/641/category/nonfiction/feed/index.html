								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At night in bed, waiting for sleep to make my mind stop chasing itself, I began praying to Hazel Kramer. Well, not exactly praying. More like bargaining. More like begging. <em>Let me tell your story</em>, I said to her. <em>Let me undo your death.</em> Because I didn’t believe that she really wanted to die.</p>
<p>She was only 38 years old. A tall, willowy woman whom Tennessee Williams described as “a redhead with great liquid brown eyes and a skin of pearly translucence.” A voice that was so lovely, she had sung on the radio. Enough money that she could afford to live without a man. All the gossips were quick to share that she was a wealthy woman. Her friends had received happy letters full of plans for the future.</p>
<p>I petitioned her in the darkness, the only light in the room the red numbers of the digital clock that told me, again, I had stayed up too late, searching for signs from her.</p>
<p><em>Did you regret leaving my father?</em> For, of course, I assumed that she had left him—not that he had left her. <em>Did you miss him— even his teasing, his bad jokes, the way he could embarrass you by drawing every cab driver and sales clerk into a long-winded conversation?</em> I knew something about that.</p>
<p><em>Or was there another man who made you happier? A man you turned to instead of my father?</em></p>
<p>This was the story that had been hinted at by my mother, her voice dropping to a whisper even though we had been the only two in the room.</p>
<p><em>Am I making snap judgments about you? Do I have it all wrong? Then let me know. I can be evenhanded. Believe me, I know what it is to be misunderstood. I know how rumor and innuendo can create a woman who never really existed.</em></p>
<p>My prayer was absorbed by the blackness.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>My father had a secret that he believed needed keeping. As best he could, he kept the details of it from my mother throughout their marriage, offering only a skeleton-truth for her to flesh out in some way that she could accept and live with. To my sister and me, he gave no hint at all. Everything I knew of my father’s life occurred either when he was a child or after he met my mother. The decades of the thirties and the forties were empty. I knew nothing of them.</p>
<p>It was September, 1973, a hot Virginia night in which the only cool air to be found came from the box fan that whirred by the sofa where my father sat with his Manhattan and the evening paper. It was one of the last weeks that I had with him before he went into the hospital and, several months later, died. That evening, as always, he wanted to know what I was studying in school, and I hurried through the math, Spanish and history, and then added, “In English, we’re reading <em>The Glass Menagerie</em>.”</p>
<p>&#8216;How hard must it have been for him to hear that and to say nothing? To not take advantage of that moment to impress me by remarking, casually, <em>Oh, yes, I knew Tom Williams</em>. My father, who craved fame and revered writers, must certainly have considered for a moment telling me at least a little of what he knew. He needn’t have said anything to me about Hazel; he could have kept that hidden, and let me think that he had met Williams in some casual way.</p>
<p>Instead, he said only, “That’s a good play. Do you like it?”</p>
<p>I never got to hear him tell me the story that was his to tell. That story was then locked in a steamer trunk in our basement, the contents of which not even my mother had seen. Indeed, she had vowed never to open it—a vow that she would one day break. A very small part of the story would be revealed in Tennessee Williams’ <em>Memoirs</em>, which came out just a year after my father died. More of the story was mine with Lyle Leverich’s <em>Tom</em>, which was published in 1995. Had I known where to look, much of the story waited in the file drawers that held my father’s unpublished plays, short fiction and novels.</p>
<p>But I didn’t know then that there was any story worth seeking.</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>Only a year before that conversation, when I was fifteen, Dad gave me an unsolicited piece of advice that I have never forgotten, so vehemently was it imparted. That I could have done anything to merit it seems unlikely, as my experience of the opposite sex at that time in my life was –much to my sorrow—severely limited.</p>
<p>We were sitting together on that same sofa in the living room, and he looked me straight in the eye and even shook his I’m-teaching-you-a-valuable-lesson finger at me.</p>
<p>“Always,” he said, and then repeated for emphasis. “Always be a lady.”</p>
<p>I laughed. “How do I do that?”</p>
<p>He leaned in closer and he didn’t smile back. “You want to know how to be a lady? Watch your mother. <em>That’s a lady.</em> You couldn’t have a better example.”</p>
<p>I nodded, though from my perspective, such a role model didn’t allow for much in the way of fun over the rest of my long, dull, ladylike life.</p>
<p>“So, who’s someone who’s <em>not</em> a lady?”</p>
<p>He waved his hand dismissively. “Don’t you worry about that. There are plenty of ‘em. You just act like your mother. Your mother would never do anything she had to be ashamed of.”</p>
<p>He settled back and picked up his newspaper, but I could tell he was still agitated by whatever had motivated this shared wisdom. I wondered at the time about the ladies in my father’s past.</p>
<p>***<br />
If my father looked at my mother&#8211; a quiet magnolia-blossom of a woman from a small Alabama town, who, as far as I could see, had never committed a sin in all of her unimpeachable life&#8211; and then held her up to me as the light I should hold aloft as I moved into the future, what would he have thought of my secrets? What would he have made of his firstborn had he lived to see me grow up?</p>
<p>He died when I was just sixteen. I had then been kissed by only three boys, and that had been the extent of my romantic history. Would my father have forgiven me for the wild, smoke-and-beer-blurred ride I had taken through the late ‘70s? The boys whose names I have forgotten? The marriages that creaked and broke beneath the weight of bad decisions? Would he have disowned me as one of the fallen, the women who were not ladies, who blackened their good names and could never undo the deed?</p>
<p>Or would my father have come to accept the woman that I became?</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I found out nothing about any of the less-than-ladies in my father’s life until after he died. I was 17 when my mother spilled to me what she took to be a great scandal. She told me in a hushed voice, her soft Alabama drawl even softer than it normally was:</p>
<p>“Your Daddy was married before he married me. For quite a while.”</p>
<p>I was astonished. And mesmerized. “What? When? For how long?”</p>
<p>“He met her when they were both at the University of Wisconsin. They got married back then. In the 1930s sometime. I think they were married for about fifteen years.”</p>
<p>Fifteen years! That was a very long time. “Did they have children?” I asked her. I immediately began to fantasize about the long lost brother or sister I had out there somewhere in the world.</p>
<p>“No,” my mother said. “No children.”</p>
<p>“What happened to her?”</p>
<p>My mother’s voice dropped even lower. “She died.”</p>
<p>I could tell from her tone that this was no ordinary death.</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know exactly. Your Daddy never wanted to talk about it. But they weren’t living together when she died…. She was somewhere—I don’t know—somewhere foreign, I think.”</p>
<p>Her voice fell to a whisper. “I think there was another man with her at the time.”</p>
<p>“Oh my God!”</p>
<p>“Don’t take the Lord’s name,” my mother replied, automatically.</p>
<p>“But how exactly did she die?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I think it was something maybe about her heart?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you ask Daddy what happened?”</p>
<p>“I told you. He didn’t like to talk about it.”</p>
<p>“Well, don’t you know anything else?” I implored her.</p>
<p>She paused, and then offered “Her name was Hazel Kramer.”</p>
<p>“Hazel!” I said. “The same name as you!”</p>
<p>Mama smiled. “Yes, your Daddy didn’t like it one bit when he found out that was my name. He didn’t like to remember her.”</p>
<p>“So—is that all?” I pushed. “All that you know?”</p>
<p>“Well, I know that she used to be Tennessee Williams’ girlfriend.”</p>
<p>If the top of my head could have come off from sheer astonishment, that would have been the moment.</p>
<p>When Williams’ book <em>Memoirs</em> was published, I eagerly thumbed through the index in the bookstore, looking for my father’s name. And there he was, Terrence McCabe, on page 38:</p>
<p><em>The onset of my cardiovascular condition occurred in the spring of 1934, and …was triggered by two things. First, the quite unexpected marriage of Hazel to a young man named Terrence McCabe, whom she had been dating at the University of Wisconsin. I felt as though the sky had fallen on me, and my reaction was to start working every evening on short stories, overcoming fatigue with black coffee.</em></p>
<p><em>One evening I was at work on a story titled “The Accent of a Coming Foot.” I had arrived at a climactic scene when I suddenly became aware that my heart was palpitating and skipping beats.</em></p>
<p>I had no idea then how to process what I was reading. Tennessee Williams was a famous playwright, and this was a major book put out by Doubleday &amp; Co. It all had to be true, then, didn’t it?</p>
<p>I showed it to my mother. She read through the pages in which he went on to describe his episode with his heart, and how he ended up in the cardiac ward at St. Vincent’s Hospital for ten days.</p>
<p>She wrinkled her nose disdainfully. “Oh, I don’t like this at all. He’s saying that your Daddy gave him a heart attack.”</p>
<p>It would be many years before I understood that what Williams was likely experiencing was closer to an anxiety attack. And it would be many more before I caught the factual errors in his story. My father and Hazel Kramer married in 1935, not 1934. And it was not in the spring, but in September.</p>
<p>All I cared about then was that my father was famous. If he had caused the renowned Tennessee Williams to have a heart attack, then that was a story with teeth in it. I told it often, loving the reaction I could elicit from my listeners.</p>
<p>Years later, another book came out that gave me more material to work with: Lyle Leverich’s very well-respected study of Williams’ early years, called simply <em>Tom</em>. I rushed to its index as I had to the one in Williams’ memoir, and found the following passage:</p>
<p><em>…on an occasion when Miss Florence was giving one of her impromptu recitals at Edwina’s piano, she suddenly stopped and announced that Hazel was engaged to be married in September to someone she had met in Wisconsin. His name was Terrence McCabe. Characteristically, Tom gave no outward sign of his feelings. Years later, however, Tennessee admitted that Terry ‘was a personable young Irishman of fantastic humor, and we hit it off well. I recall an hilarious evening the three of us spent together, after getting quite drunk—at least I did at the St. Louis Athletic Club. We drove around town, singing and exchanging mad jokes.’ But such ‘an hilarious evening’ must always end sadly when ‘the three of us’ became the two of them and the one of him. Regarding Hazel, he confessed, “I never loved anyone as I loved her,” and long after she married McCabe, Tennessee told his mother that the beautiful redhead was very much the deepest love of his life.</em></p>
<p>This was so amazing I couldn’t quite take it in. My father had gone out for an evening with Tennessee Williams—had gotten drunk with him, sang with him, told jokes with him! Moreover, here Williams was not blaming Dad for the onset of a health condition, but conceding that he was “personable” and good-natured, full of fun—all things I knew to be true.</p>
<p>At this point, I did not pursue any further investigations into Tom Williams’ life. But I took great pleasure as I began teaching my favorite of Williams’ plays, <em>A Streetcar Named Desire</em>, in regaling my students with my connection, however peripheral, to the playwright’s past. It made a good story. And I love a good story. I didn’t yet know that the story I knew was merely a fragment of what there was to tell.</p>
<p>In May of 2013, everything changed. A close friend sent me an email with an offhand question that so intrigued me that it set me on a course to uncover the story that I had not known existed. He asked me, “Did you know that, in his later years, Tennessee Williams wrote a play called <em>The Red Devil Battery Sign</em> in which there is a character actually named Terrence McCabe?”</p>
<p>No. I had not known. But I was about to find out—about that, and more.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I had moved just a year before, from a large 5-bedroom colonial where I had lived for nearly thirty years to a small townhouse. I had not planned on moving, but my marriage fell apart with a suddenness that left me reeling, and with my husband gone, I could no longer afford to stay in the house in which I had raised my daughters.</p>
<p>Many of my possessions were still in boxes, and I began to dig through them, looking for the artifacts of my father’s life that I had somehow managed to claim for myself when my mother moved from my childhood home. I remembered a black and moldering album of photos and clippings. I had thought that the album was my father’s, but when at last I came upon it again, I realized with a start that the album had actually belonged to Hazel. Here were not only photographs of her mother, her grandparents and my father, but also a to-do list scrawled on a tattered yellow paper of tasks to be accomplished before their wedding, newspaper clippings announcing their engagement and a hotel’s “Do Not Disturb” sign—a testament to a moment so intimate and yet so naively young and hopeful that it made my heart ache for both of them.</p>
<p>I looked through all the photos I found of them when they were young and in love.<br />
One shows Hazel sitting on my father’s lap, smiling, almost laughing, directly into the camera, one hand resting on my father’s chest, the other around his neck. Daddy looks up at her with what can only be called adoration, a grin on his face, his eyes fixed on hers.</p>
<p>I have never seen a single photograph of my mother sitting on my father’s lap.</p>
<p>They look so blissful, so unaware of all that will happen later. Perhaps she went on to do terrible things to my father. Perhaps he may have done a terrible thing or two himself. But seeing them like this, I just couldn’t believe it. And I found welling up in me a kind of pity, a tenderness for this as yet undefiled love. I have known this place. What a grace it is that none of us know at the time that it will all be taken away, that what is surely love can be so thoroughly lost and ruined.</p>
<p>I found also a series of photographs that they clearly took of each other, experimenting with lighting. In several, she is lying back on a couch or bed, in what is so blatantly an effort to look alluring, seductive, that it made me embarrassed for her. She is not a classically pretty woman, but in each of these shots, a heat rises up from her, a languorous desire to be seen, to be admired, to be touched.</p>
<p>In one of the photos in this series, she even appears to be naked, though perhaps the top of her low-cut dress is simply out of the frame. And yet, I believe she would have easily posed naked for my father.</p>
<p>And I can also imagine what happened after they grew restless with taking pictures.</p>
<p>I have never seen photographs like this of my mother.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In a <em>Playboy</em> interview that ran in April of 1973, Williams spoke briefly of Hazel.</p>
<p><em>My great female love was a girl named Hazel from St. Louis. But she was frigid. She’d make me count to ten before she’d let me kiss her; we were both 11 when we met and we were sweethearts until she was in college. She said, “Tom, we’re much too young to think about these things.” But I constantly thought about sex….</em></p>
<p>I had to smile at this when I found it. Frigid! The woman who posed for my father in these photographs does not appear to be frigid. Maybe, Tom, she simply did not want you, despite how much you desired her. Perhaps she did not want to hurt your pride.</p>
<p>From the album that I return to, again and again, I gingerly pull out a picture of her that was clipped from a newspaper, faded and grainy with pixels I see and then unsee.</p>
<p>Here she is a songbird. A torch singer. She stands with her arms held away from her body. Her chin is lifted, her white skin lit even whiter by whatever light there is in the room. The enormous brown eyes watch me. Her mouth opens to release a note.</p>
<p>There is a caption below the photo: <em>The thrills and frills of nightclub life are gaining favor with University of Wisconsin students this fall, and here is one of the reasons. She is Miss Hazel Kramer, co-ed from St. Louis, shown here in one of the Mae West numbers she enacts as a featured entertainer in the floor shows at the 770 Club… .</em></p>
<p>The year is 1933. Two Mae West films were released that year—<em>She Done Him Wrong</em> and <em>I’m No Angel</em>, both with Cary Grant. They were the last of West’s films released before the censors clamped down on all the risqué wordplay, the suggestive lyrics.</p>
<p>I wonder which song she is singing here. Something sweet and romantic, perhaps, like “I Want You, I Need You”? No. I don’t think so. This is a Mae West revue, after all, and Mae West is known not for her sweetness, but for her sass. For her bawdiness. I turn back to the photo and put other West lyrics into her mouth…</p>
<p><em>Aw, come on, let me cling on to ya like a vine</em><br />
<em> Make that lowdown music trickle off your spine</em><br />
<em> Baby, I can warm ya with this love of mine</em><br />
<em> I’m no angel…</em></p>
<p>Why choose to sing Mae West if you are not going to play it up, sex it up, and wait for the whoops and whistles?</p>
<p>For a moment, I think of my mother singing hymns in the kitchen, her flawless soprano careful and sweet&#8211; <em>O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder, consider all the worlds thy hands have made….</em></p>
<p>Back inside the photo, my father is at the piano. The caption continues, <em>She is accompanied here by Terrence McCabe, campus pianist</em>.</p>
<p>Campus pianist! Once upon a time, it seems, my father could play music. He could hear music &#8212; the deafness he was born with in one ear not yet having found its way into the other. He is all profile and chiseled cheekbone here&#8211; handsome in a way that startles me. Here he is not my father. I can understand why she wants him.</p>
<p>The father I knew wore a hearing aid, a device that seemed to me then a useless bit of plastic that often became dislodged from his ear, splitting the air with a piercing and frequently embarrassing whistle. It didn’t seem to be of any use in helping him to hear us. To communicate with him, the family relied on careful enunciation that he could lip-read, and often, laborious finger-spelling and hand signals.</p>
<p>And so I was shocked, near the end of his life, when he revealed to me something I had not known. He could hear—just a little bit. Sometimes. With great effort.</p>
<p>It was the evening of my 8th grade choral concert. I was decked out in my new dress and black patent leather shoes, twirling in front of Dad so he could admire me. I was sad that he was not coming to the concert, but I understood. What would be the point?</p>
<p>He saw the look in my eyes, and motioned me close to him.</p>
<p>“What’s your favorite song in the show?” he asked.</p>
<p>“ ‘To Dream The Impossible Dream,’ ” I told him. “From <em>Man of La Mancha</em>.”</p>
<p>“Sing it for me now.”</p>
<p>I raised one eyebrow, quizzically. “Why? You won’t hear me.”</p>
<p>He undid the buttons of his crisp white shirt to reveal the small amplification device he wore strapped to his chest. He turned a dial on it and beckoned me close. “Sing into this,” he said. “Sing real loud.”</p>
<p>I sat next to him on the sofa, lowered my lips to his chest and began, belting out the lyrics with more force than I ever had in chorus class. <em>To dream the impossible dream/to fight the unbeatable foe….</em></p>
<p>I pulled back and looked at him. My question was wordless, but he understood it. He nodded and smiled. He could hear me! I sang the song through and he applauded. My eyes filled and I turned my face away so he would not see how much it meant to me that my father at last knew what I sounded like.</p>
<p>I left for the concert, happy, though I wonder now, looking back, if Dad had only pretended to hear my song. At least he had made the attempt. I think of Hazel, whose father had given her up to be adopted by her grandparents when she was just an infant&#8211; the man who signed away all rights to her, never seeing her throughout her childhood. She had a beautiful voice—one that he had never heard.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In the <em>Playboy</em> interview, Williams continued, skipping quickly over the years: <em>Hazel and I both went on pills and liquor. She married another man but killed herself when she was still very young.</em></p>
<p>Suicide. This was not the story my mother was told.</p>
<p>Did my father see this interview? It appeared five months before he entered the hospital, eight months before he died. Certainly if he had seen the issue on a newsstand in our local drugstore, with cover copy advertising an interview with Tennessee Williams, he would have been curious to know what Tom had had to say.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Deep in the bottom of a large envelope that also contained a greeting card and several small photographs, I found a newspaper notice of Hazel’s death. Four words leapt out at me: <em>suddenly, in Mexico City</em>. Was “suddenly” a euphemism for what had really occurred? A couple of relatives, when questioned, had mentioned that they had heard she had died in a car accident. Was the accident a story my father had fabricated to hide the truth? If she had killed herself, why had she done so? Did it have anything to do with my father? Was this why he wanted the story to be told differently?</p>
<p>In another album, I have a snapshot that was taken of me as an infant. On the back of it my father had scrawled a message, no doubt to his own parents, with whom he shared photographs by mail, long before the internet made this unnecessary. It read: <em>Whatever my sins, real or imagined, this little girl has absolved them for me</em>. The first time I had ever read those words, I merely smiled. It showed me how deeply my father had loved me. But now I revisited the message, and read it differently. What were the sins that needed absolving? Had my father merely imagined some wrongdoing, perhaps out of guilt—or had he actually done something wrong, something of which he was deeply ashamed?</p>
<p>***<br />
I went looking for the story of how Hazel died—and found it. Or found parts of it. Enough pieces to fit together to realize that there were pieces missing, pieces that would make all the difference in understanding exactly what had happened—not only to her, but to my father.</p>
<p>The ubiquitous slogan may well be “What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas,” but I now think Mexico City could be more accurately substituted here in place of Nevada’s famous gambling town. At least in Las Vegas, people and events are still subject to the laws and recordkeeping of the United States government. In America, the past can be returned to if one knows where to look. But I soon learned that in Mexico, the past lives only as long as the memories of those who lived it. And a deep suspicion is harbored there for anyone who tries to uncover that past and drag it out into the light of the present day.</p>
<p>Only one lucky thing came from the location of her death. Because she was an American citizen who had died in a foreign country, the State Department had maintained a report of her death that had been archived all these many years.</p>
<p>My mother had told me she believed there may have been another man with Hazel when she died. And there had been—a man who discovered her body after she had succumbed to an overdose of Seconals. A man who told police that he had been given a key to her apartment in <em>el distrito federal</em> so that he might check on her, concerned because she drank heavily and took sleeping pills. A man who had checked on her twice that day, before finally finding her dead the third time that he checked. A man with a wife of his own. An American man who said he had known her several years before, when they both lived in New York City. A man with a name that was common enough that finding him would prove very difficult.</p>
<p>I spent the summer of 2013 pursuing him. I tried first to employ two separate Mexican private investigators, but both refused to take my job. The man I sought had been questioned by police and then released. I was told that in Mexico, no records would have been kept unless there had been an actual conviction. And even then, sixty-two years had passed since that night. I was searching for one small grain of sand along a beach covered by billions of such grains. They shrugged, said no, and wished me <em>buena suerte</em>. I was left to my own ingenuity.</p>
<p>Every night I would Google his name, along with other key words that might single him out among the countless hits that would turn up and lead me nowhere. I encountered a young man with the same name who suffered from a debilitating illness. I found another man with that name who was a noted outdoorsman. I searched his full name; I searched possible nicknames. I made a family tree for him on Ancestry.com, and found yet another gentleman with that name who had also lived in New York City, but was born twenty years too early to be my guy.</p>
<p>It was nearing the end of the summer, and I was growing desperate. I would return to my teaching job in just a week, and I knew that then my time to devote to researching would be severely limited. It was well after midnight and I tried yet another Google search, expecting to encounter the same fruitless links and wrong paths that I had combed through all August.</p>
<p>But this time there was something different: a wedding announcement, for a wedding that had taken place in 2009. The groom’s grandfather, referred to as “late” or deceased, was the name I was hunting for. Something about this hit felt unlike all the others. I felt a thrill of possibility.</p>
<p>The groom had an even more common name than his grandfather, but I knew the city he was living in. I searched for him on Facebook—and bingo. I scrolled through his friend list. There was a woman there who was a generation older and had the same last name I had been seeking. I sent messages to both of them. To the woman, I said that I was looking for this man who had once lived in Mexico City, and wondered if, perhaps, she was his daughter.</p>
<p>A week or more went by and I heard nothing. Another dead end, I presumed. And then suddenly, a message from her. “Yes,” she wrote me. “That sounds like my father.”</p>
<p>What followed over the next few months was a clumsy “courtship” in which I tried to get her to open up and talk to me, but she resisted. Ultimately, she told me very little. The most startling piece of information she shared was that her mother, a woman named Loretta, the wife of the man who had found Hazel, was still alive. She was 94, remarried and living in Florida.</p>
<p>The daughter questioned Loretta, and told me that her mother remembered nothing of Hazel or her unfortunate death. I tried writing to Loretta directly, sending photographs of Hazel that I hoped might jar her memory. I received no reply.</p>
<p>What did the silence mean? I considered several possibilities. Perhaps Loretta truly had no memory at all of Hazel or of that fateful night in Mexico City. Maybe her husband had lied when he told the police that both he and his wife were friends of Hazel’s; maybe it was only he who had known her; maybe he had hidden this relationship from his wife. Or perhaps Loretta remembered all too well, and did not want to relive the past – or did not want her daughter to learn unpleasant truths about her father.</p>
<p>This search to learn more about the man who was with Hazel the night she died—a search that is still ongoing&#8211; is only one small facet of the quest that has driven me since I began this research into my father’s first marriage. Seven months have passed, and what I have unearthed has been considerable. I have read virtually every book available, either by or about Tennessee Williams. I have read, as well, the Williams’ works that include characters modeled on either Hazel or my father. I have discovered my father’s own book about that marriage, a thinly-veiled memoir disguised as a novel. I contacted a cousin who had known Hazel, and searched for and found the daughter of my father’s best friend, who remembered Hazel from the days when she was a teenager. I have tracked down three court cases filed by Hazel in a dispute involving her grandmother’s will, traveling to Chicago to research two of those cases, and stumbling upon the testimony of my own grandparents. I contacted the daughter of Esmeralda Mayes, a close childhood friend of both Hazel and Tom, and enlisted her help in searching through her mother’s papers for information about Hazel. I searched for – and found—the grandchildren of Hazel’s biological father, to learn that Hazel had reunited with her father in her adult years, and that they remembered their Aunt Hazel and had photographs to share with me.</p>
<p>A friend joked that I have become a “stalker.” If it is possible to stalk a ghost, then I concede that it may be true. I have even dreamed about her, which is not surprising, for I have spent entire days sifting through her life, as well as the lives of those who knew her, and at night, when I lie in bed trying to unwind and sleep, my mind will not always let go of her.</p>
<p>What was it about the unraveling of this mystery that was so important to me? Why had I latched onto it with a single-mindedness that at times surprised even me? I spent the months between May and December of 2013 so firmly ensconced in the past, in the years between 1933 and 1951, that I had trouble keeping one foot inside the present day.</p>
<p>The year leading up to the onset of this preoccupation had been a difficult and unsettling one for me. My marriage had buckled under the weight of a revelation I found I could not live with. I had moved from the familiar home I had lived in since I was 27. My mother had died after a long and memory-devastating illness, and my beloved sister had been diagnosed with cancer.</p>
<p>Nothing seemed predictable or certain. The future was a slippery thing that could slide from my grasp in an instant. But the past was something that could not be changed. I might never know it fully. I might have to search relentlessly to uncover the life my father had lived before he married my mother, and to reveal the woman he had so deeply loved when he was a young man. But the story was real. It had an essential truth to it that could not be altered, if only I would look deeply enough.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The woman that my mother told me about all those many years ago, this first Hazel, my father’s red-haired bride, took on for me when I was still a teenager the hazy outline of a villain. A femme fatale who captivated and toyed with men and then cast them aside. A shady lady with dark secrets who somehow deserved to come to no good. It was true that she had broken Tennessee Williams’ heart. And that she then went on to break my father’s. I had no doubt of that then. And I have no doubt of it now.</p>
<p>What surprises me is how much I have come to care about her.</p>
<p>How difficult must it have been for her to grow up knowing that her father gave her away? To have to own up to friends that her parents were divorced in 1913, when she was just a baby, at a time when divorce was almost unheard of, certainly among “respectable” women? To have to cope with a mother who was possessive, demanding and immature? Who tried to compensate for the loss of her husband by placing an unnaturally heavy emphasis on her relationship with her daughter? With grandparents who were stern, emotionally-unavailable and obsessed with their vast fortune and who would inherit it when they died? A grandfather who had inspired her to announce when she was a young woman, “I will never marry a German”?</p>
<p>It is easy for me to see how she could have fallen in love with my father. He was honest, funny, outgoing, and most important of all, emotionally open—everything her family was not.</p>
<p>I believe that she loved him. I know quite well how possible it is to love someone deeply and honestly—and then to stop loving them. I know also what it is to be misjudged by those who don’t have all the details of the story.</p>
<p>I have been trying to restore not only my father’s story, but hers, as well. Someone should know who she was, what she felt, why she died. There is a truth there that has been lost. And I wanted to find it, not only for myself, but for her, as well.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The night before my father went into the hospital, he looked up from his reading, which I’m sure he was only half-looking at anyway, and asked me a question that so startled me, I have never forgotten it.</p>
<p>“Mel,” he said, “are you afraid to die?”</p>
<p>Even at the age of sixteen, a young girl, I knew this was not the sort of question a father was supposed to ask his daughter. It alerted me instantly to some things about my father that I had not previously known, or at least, understood—that he was mortal, that he feared this operation he was about to have, that he felt close enough to me to ask such a question and perhaps, did not feel able to ask such a question of my mother.</p>
<p>And somehow, I knew, too, that the appropriate response would be to say something reassuring, to help my father to feel less afraid. But in those few words he had spoken to me something that was true and unguarded. I could not give him back anything less.</p>
<p>“Yes” I said. “I am.” I paused, waited. Then added, “Are you?”</p>
<p>He nodded. “Yes.”</p>
<p>We looked at each other, without words, and I put my hand over his.</p>
<p>And then something changed. It was as though the Angel of Parental Discretion and Reason had laid a hand on his shoulder to remind him that he had ventured into a realm where it was inappropriate to take one’s child. The mood shifted. He made light of his anxieties, seeing the concern in my eyes, and that was that.</p>
<p>It was the last time I ever spoke to him.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Most people have the opportunity to someday meet their parents on a level playing field. To speak to them, not as a child to a parent, but as an adult to an adult. In the normal order of things, most people cross over from childhood and meet their parents in the world of grown-ups, come to know them in a whole new way. It was a transition that I was able to make with my mother. But the journey was cut short with my father. We remained forever parent and young child.</p>
<p>This search for my father’s early life has been more than just a quest for Hazel, a mysterious woman with whom I feel a strange kinship. It has also been a quest to continue the relationship I once had with my father—to somehow bring him back to me.</p>
<p>That night when he asked me if I feared death, he had taken the first step toward treating me as an equal, toward a more adult relationship. He had begun that conversation.</p>
<p>It is a conversation I am still trying to have.<br />

<p>Talking lips don’t grow cold;<br />
babble and jabber.<br />
Inside a beehive, a fortune.<br />
Abracadabra.<br />
What was lost was held<br />
inside a tale.<br />
The tall stories I told<br />
utterly real.</p>
<p>from “Scheherazade”<br />
by Carol Ann Duffy</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Snow fell until the end of April and lingered on the ground well into May. As the month progressed dandelions, usually the first pollen producers, flowered slowly, so there was little for bees to forage. Since it was so cold and there wasn’t much to eat, surely my queen was laying little brood and there was still plenty of room in the hive for her to increase the numbers once the weather brightened. A swarm, a bee colony’s division, usually occurs where there’s not enough space for the population to increase. In mid-May, however, during the first warm week, half of my colony swelled into a cluster cloud and lodged across the street on a tree limb too near power lines to catch and re-hive. From my front porch I watched the departing brood beat their wings in a steady state on the branch, like the way we tread water to avoid drowning, while scout bees searched for new digs in a tree hollow or under a sheltered eve.</p>
<p>I could only imagine that this swarm occurring amid such unlikely circumstances had to be caused by something other than a need for more room. Folklore imparts that a colony may divide when the beekeeper does not reveal substantive news about the realm where the bees reside. The adage goes, “Marriage, birth, or burying,/news across the seas,/All your sad or marrying,/You must tell the bees.” As I watched the buzzing black mass stopped across the street, I was reminded of the watchwords and reflected on news that I was incapable of admitting to myself, never mind the bees: my marriage was ending.</p>
<p>If the proverb was accurate and I had found the courage to walk the few feet from my house to the apiary to convey my sorrow out loud, it may have brought solace to the colony and quelled its impulse to fissure. Instead, as my husband packed his belongings, I kept to myself, possibly causing the bees to lose their mooring, intuiting an anxiety surrounding the hive. I sat on the porch stoop waiting, as one would at the bedside of a failing family member, knowing at twilight the swarming half of the colony would finally leave the vicinity of the bee yard, needing more shelter than the tree limb to survive the night cold.</p>
<p>As expected, when evening fell, they vanished.</p>
<p>II<br />
Although the timing of the swarm in my apiary mirrored my own separation, little else was similar. When the scouts found suitable dwelling and the rest followed, establishing domicile in an unknown habitat, they transformed themselves into feral bees. In contrast, my husband moved just around the corner. For our son, it was a fortunate choice; he could easily shuttle back and forth between houses. For me, I had to keep reliving the cliché cause of our split: her car parked in his driveway, long weekends knowing they were away, the injury of rejection inflicted again and again just by proximity.</p>
<p>It’s not as if I hadn’t experienced domestic rupture before the break-up of my marriage. My father was a disabled veteran incapable of working because of the shell shock he experienced during the Second World War. My mother, brother, and I endured silences that lasted for days while he smoked pack after pack of cigarettes, bit his fingernails beyond the quick, reliving bombs that sunk his aircraft carrier, leaving he and his crew mates presumed dead and floating in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Rather than become ensnared in his quietness, we worked around him and our overlooking of his downheartedness made me immune to its despair. Ironically, my happiest childhood memories include time spent with my despondent dad. The two of us would take drives in our blue Rambler station wagon and between us, I situated my orange, battery-powered record player so we could listen to his favorite forty-fives: Jim Croce’s “Time in a Bottle” or “Bad, Bad Leroy Brown,” Simon and Garfunkle’s “Cecilia.” By ignoring his melancholy and backhandedly taking care of him, I learned that difficulty was no reason to lose faith.</p>
<p>In the face of trouble, though, my upbringing taught me a tough stance of allegiance that sometimes would not serve me well as an adult. My sense of loyalty is probably the reason it took me so long to reckon that life with my husband was beyond repair. He would arrive home to a dark house, any highlights from my day swallowed by excuses. In the morning, boiling water for tea, he watched our son master the skill of pinching a Cheerio between his index finger and thumb, the previous night’s explanations overlooked so a semblance of household commitment might be established.</p>
<p>Carol Ann Duffy’s “Hive” declares how the domicile of bees “is love,/what we serve, preserve, avowed in Latin murmurs/as we come and go [. . .].” Such fidelity to the domestic certainly was in force while we took care of my father. With the break-up of my marriage, however, I winced at the poem’s celebration of familial dedication. Out in my apiary, the bees’ devotion to each other was lost on the human habitat alongside their own.</p>
<p>III<br />
In an apiary there is no arrival of a trophy queen that upsets the balance. Nor does the existent queen possess what Charles Darwin, in <em>The Origin of Species</em>, mistakenly identified as a “savage instinctive hatred” that causes her to “destroy the young queens, her daughters.” No one bee, even the queen, exercises that much control over the colony.</p>
<p>Using the purported hive culture, however, that Darwin imagined, women are often cast as rivalries especially surrounding the affections of men. Yet drones, the males, in a bee colony, hold no special status. In fact, as a hive downsizes in preparation for winter, most are tossed from the hive to die.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was my admiration for the colony’s symbiotic collaboration among its females that caused me to introduce myself to my husband’s new woman in the grocery store parking lot. In the flesh I hoped we could outwit the Darwinian competitive strictures in which we’d been cast, especially since they centered on the behest of a man.</p>
<p>While she pulled into a space and got out of her car, I watched her cross the pavement. She spotted me when it was too late to retreat and lowered her head in what I imagined was an impossible attempt to escape. I waited at the doorway and when we stood face to face, I held out my hand, but she only babbled, “Take care of yourself.”</p>
<p>I withdrew at her unsolicited advice, the insult exacerbated by my knowing she had entered my home, at my ex-husband’s invitation, while I was at work. From the time I learned of it, I often thought of her arriving in our driveway and my ex-husband secretly welcoming her at the back door. How did they both avert any sense of conscience as the black and white photos of his parents as well as my own looked at them from the walls of the entryway? As they moved to the sunroom, did he recount our family vacations when she surly spotted the picture of our son in my arms blowing a pinwheel in the ocean breeze? In the kitchen, when she saw the breakfast dishes in the sink, did he tell her that he always made my morning coffee, even on that day? In our bedroom, how did she measure my character when she saw my jewelry strewn on my dresser, my week’s clothing piled on the rocking chair, my books stacked on my nightstand?</p>
<p>Robber bees can enter a hive when the colony has little ability to defend itself. With stealth, they strip the honey and take over the comb until there is no room for the host bees. With equal callousness, this woman had sex with my husband in our home. I struggled in the parking lot to keep focused and mumbled good-bye, making my way to my car without surrender of Darwinian enmity. On that, bees clearly have pre-eminence.</p>
<p>IV<br />
The camaraderie of my fellow beekeepers helped lift my spirits as I went through the reckoning of my marriage’s end. Curiously, the majority of my beekeeping friends are men. Nationally, they’ve long outnumbered women by more than two to one, though the data is less than scientific. Even sketchier, however, are the reasons more men than women are drawn to bees. Of course, the joke is they simply enjoy the company of females. They are welcome comrades, though; especially since the only other male presence in the apiary are the pathetic drones.</p>
<p>A favorite beekeeper is Eaton whose extensive apicultural knowledge came from four generations of his family, which had long kept bees on their Vermont farm. He introduced me to euphemisms such as, “If you don’t like my gate, don’t swing on it” or “That one’s climbing up Fool’s Hill.” When it was cold, he said his “corners” were freezing.</p>
<p>Eaton and I often worked together in my bee yard. Under his tutelage, I hefted hive boxes and tipped them on an ordinary bathroom scale to weigh the needed winter honey store. He also taught me how to identify the queen, her abdomen longer than those belonging to her retinue whose members surround her like numbers on a clock.</p>
<p>When my bees swarmed that spring, I immediately called Eaton who arrived in minutes, his smoker lit, ready to climb a ladder and help me retrieve the colony before he determined that telephone lines made it impossible.</p>
<p>With my marriage dissolving, time spent with Eaton gradually began to renew my self-esteem. We developed a harmless, flirty repartee that often involved my aversion to wearing the trademark, white beekeeper’s jumpsuit. Once when he delivered a box of workers to help a struggling colony, as we hoisted it onto the hive, he warned not to be sorry if the bees got into my “knickers.” I laughed and responded that at my age “it’s all about avoiding hot flashes” to which he bent over double. It felt good to be so comfortable in a man’s company.</p>
<p>V<br />
When I open a hive, prying the outer and inner covers from their propolis bond, wresting the frames from their housing, and inspecting the brood, I must be calm and respectful. Otherwise, the bees will attack, their high-pitched buzz calling others to the fore to circle and sting.</p>
<p>As I worked in the bee yard, the fact that I could so readily transcend into the bee realm taught me that my heartache was not impervious. I could recreate a life other than the one I shared with my husband.</p>
<p>Jarah, an entomologist that I met at the university where I worked, was also pivotal in helping me regain my footing. I enrolled in an apicultural short course he taught, the topic of which, ironically, was the queen’s mating habits. Before long, as he introduced her reproductive anatomy, I found myself easing into the heart of his lesson, becoming gratifyingly distracted from myself.</p>
<p>Just by his dress, Jarah piqued my interest. On my maternal side, I come from a line of cobblers, milliners, tailors, and seamstresses. Clothing, as a result, is not an incidental. As Jarah explained the benefits of the queen’s deliberate mating with multiple partners, I noted his linen trousers and blue cotton shirt, nothing unusual for a male academic. Yet, I judged his pants’ crease lines, whether the indent above the ankle was deep enough, and if his shirt had a single top stitch around the collar. My eye even measured the width of his collar points, noting they were narrow, what I preferred.</p>
<p>In contrast, slides of him in the apiary, projected on the big screen behind while he spoke, depicted him, for the labor involved, in more suitable jeans and a red chemise shirt. After his talk, I introduced myself as a fellow faculty member, though my pedigree is English. Despite our differing disciplines, he seemed grateful for a kindred spirit in the room, given his audience was comprised mostly of beginning beekeepers whose day jobs were removed not only from an apiary but also a university. We agreed to meet later in the week in the school coffee shop to talk bees since others in the crush around him wanted to ask questions.</p>
<p>When I readied on the morning of our appointment, I armed myself with a couple poetry collections, the mid-century Poems of a Bee-Keeper by Everard Stokes and my beloved, new-century, <em>The Bees</em> by Duffy. Like me, Jarah arrived with something to share, a syllabus for “Introduction to the Honey Bee and Beekeeping” that he taught to undergraduate, non-science majors. As I examined his class plan, I gave him Stokes and Duffy to inspect. While focusing on what we brought, we avoided any awkward silences that our initial unfamiliarity with one another might cause.</p>
<p>Two thirds of his syllabus was predictable enough for an entomologist, but the final third dealt with bees in mythology, religion, history, and literature.</p>
<p>“What texts do you use,” I asked, but Jarah explained that most of his lectures in the last section were “stand alone” where he only made casual references to writers and stories.</p>
<p>Given he only glossed this part of the syllabus and noting one of the assignments, I asked, “So you expect students to really write poems?”</p>
<p>The requirement seemed a toss off to me, diminishing the reading and practice necessary to do good work. “I suppose you think anyone can write a poem and anyone can judge one too,” I continued.</p>
<p>On the defensive, Jarah countered, “Well, could you teach the first two sections?”<br />
“No,” I said. “I have no idea about any of that. It’s not my training, so I wouldn’t presume to teach it, at least not with any authority.”</p>
<p>“Well what if we meet regularly,” he offered. “I’ll teach you about bee biology and you can teach me about poetry.” We agreed. The prospect of seeing him on a regular basis was exciting.</p>
<p>VI<br />
As spring came on and dandelions began to bloom, during one of our sessions Jarah and I both coincidentally brought in burr comb to sample that our individual colonies were making across the top of our hives’ frames, rather than on the foundation. Since bees will build comb anywhere there’s space, when they do so on the top of the hive, underneath the inner cover, it has to be removed or else it makes inspecting the colony difficult.</p>
<p>If they start storing honey in the burr comb and it’s scraped out gently enough, the beekeeper can get a decent harvest. As I unwrapped the foil in which Jarah brought his, its collection of hexagons had just a touch of honey in each one. Tumbling it around my mouth, the sealing suddenly broke and a grade of thick medium amber gushed onto my tongue before the wax hardened and I had to spit it out.</p>
<p>Jarah did likewise, putting a gob of mine in his mouth and uttering an almost requisite “ummm,” when the honey met his taste buds. “Whose do you think is best,” he tauntingly asked.</p>
<p>“Mine,” I said immediately. “Yours came from lab hives. Mine is from a real colony.”<br />
Our meetings always had an edge of playfulness, but Jarah could also be quite serious and consoling. He gradually learned the circumstances of my home life. Once, I compared myself to the carpenter bee in one of Natasha Tretheway’s poems of the same title. The bee, in the piece, builds an elaborate nest inside the framing of the speaker’s porch. Eventually, the speaker has the entry hole filled and when the bee, whose been foraging, returns, she can no longer get inside. The speaker is reminded of herself: “[. . .] Watching her,/I think of what I’ve left behind, returned to,/only to find everything changed, nothing but/my memory intact[. . .].”</p>
<p>When I described the kinship between Tretheway’s poem and my life, Jarah pointedly asked if the piece continued, what would be the bee’s next actions? It was a question I thought characteristic of a scientist, who, rather than succumbing to the metaphor, returned to the physical. The bee would obviously hover at the impenetrable entrance only for a limited time, before finding a new spot to begin building a new elaborate network in which to nest. It was an instinct that I too had to adopt in order to recover from my marriage’s end.</p>
<p>As much as Jarah learned the details of my separation, I learned of his personal life. Namely, that he is married. As a result, I tried to merely delight in the intimate longings that he inspired; relieved they still existed. When on an extended research trip, though, I nearly crossed a line, sending him Duffy’s short poem “Bees,” where the speaker, in the closing lines, declares, “[. . .] know of us:/how your scent pervades/my shadowed, busy heart/and honey is art.” If he asked me about it, which thankfully he never did, I could always explain the poem literally: that the speaker was confiding to the bees how much she cared.</p>
<p>VII<br />
Despite the loss a beekeeper feels when a colony divides, swarms, in their own right, carry centuries of mystique and appeal that span countless cultures. Traditions as diverse as the Hindu and Mayan believe the sound of a mass of migrating bees carries power. The Hindu call it “bhramaram,” the hum of the bee, which drives away demons. Likewise, the Mayan believe the sound carries healing and protective properties that their Shaman mimic during ritual chants.</p>
<p>I attest an approaching swarm is a sight like no other and, because of its murmur, it is often heard before seen. Twice, long before becoming a beekeeper, I’ve walked down the same hillside only to hear the sudden dulcet tone in the breeze before witnessing the black pulsating cloud overhead. Once, as I watched a swarm beat by, my son was with me, then a boy, hardly able to know the full breadth of thousands of bees flying tightly together over our heads. Yet as we walked home, the sight lifted his steps, like mine, as it drifted toward the horizon.</p>
<p>In time, I embraced the ancient draw of a swarm. I refashioned my house and its surrounding property so that it would manifest my newfound strength. Near my apiary, my son and I screwed planks together for four oblong raised garden beds. We hauled and spread compost and topsoil in them and planted tomatoes, basil, spinach, and a host of aromatic herbs to use in my newly renovated kitchen. I also restored a set of stained glass windows that looked out to the bee yard. In the summer, when it is especially hot, the smell of honey breezes inside.</p>
<p>VIII<br />
Ancient Egyptians would rub into wounds that struggled to heal a salve made of honey, beeswax, and fourteen different plants. Every civilization since then has touted honey for its healing properties. For me, every aspect of tending my bees: hive observation, inspection, maintenance, the harvest, writing about them, using their honey and giving it away, works as my curative tonic.</p>
<p>And on this July morning, as I check the health of my hives, I think that although science has advanced beekeeping so much in the last century, the unknown also seems to enshrine life in the apiary. Hearing the bees’ low susurrate as I open a cover, I wonder at the way the brood has repopulated itself since the swarm.</p>
<p>Although my marriage’s end certainly underscored a loss of faith, what is to say that my swarming bees did not chase away the dispirit that enveloped the house, their wings shifting the wind before heading to uncertainty? As I appraise the comb, the brood is tending the queen, feeding the young, and, as it does most days, synthesizing nectar into honey that I will spoon into tea, spread on toast, or use to treat what can be slow to heal.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the summer he wore madras shorts and a black turtleneck and small, round dark-framed glasses. He was from a different town, went to a different school, and I was intrigued by this tall thin figure half in black. And he was intrigued by me. I wish I could remember the details of our early courtship, how we exchanged the phone numbers that led to the convoluted late night conversations that bordered on psychological warfare. I wish I could remember what I was thinking on the train ride that late summer day when we had our first date. Or the exact feeling behind our perfect kiss under a tree in the park at the center of town. I only remember calling it perfect in my mind, and that no other first kiss has quite matched it.</p>
<p>But then he left for boarding school. He sent bulky packages full of black and white photographs that he had developed in his school darkroom and I sent scraps of poetry copied from anthologies stolen from my English department’s lounge. And then, late one mid-January night, the phone rang. I was in bed, wrapped up in plum flannel sheets bleached grey by the moonlight. He was at a payphone in his dorm, leaning against the cinderblock wall, squinting in the fluorescent light. He had just slit his wrists. There was blood on the floor, he said, but he had found a bandage.</p>
<p>Here too, I forget. I don’t remember what he said or I said. I don’t remember how I knew that his attempt wasn’t serious, that he wasn’t going to die that night in the cold bright hall. After I hung up I lay still in my warm sheets, gazing up at the glow-in-the-dark stars arranged on my ceiling in constellations known only to me. The next day I went to school and learned that the U.S. had just declared war on Iraq, and I sat through my classes in silence. Later I remember calling his parents. His mother was quiet, unsurprised.</p>
<p>He was sent home. The next time I saw him was on his sun porch. We sat on the same couch where we had lounged watching movies with his little brother, where his dad had once caught us asleep together and started yelling, where I broke his father’s hold on my arm before I stalked out. He was in shorts again, even though it was January, and a coarsely woven argyle sweater. He would not talk to me and when I tried to talk to him he hit himself in the face. He never gave me an explanation. I could no longer stay.</p>
<p>Six months later I left for Michigan. My first year at the University I got all A’s and lived in a high tiny single. I dated a French horn player and read Isak Dinesen. By the time I was a sophomore I had declared myself an English major. My junior year I rented my first apartment on South University and sat on its hard red couch looking out an enormous corner window onto the street below.</p>
<p>Somewhere in between my first room at Michigan and my first apartment on South University I saw Francis Ford Coppola’s <em>Dracula</em> and promptly fell in love with it. The film takes Dracula’s line from the book – “I too can love; you yourselves can tell it from the past” – and runs with it all the way back to the Middle Ages. The Dracula from the book becomes Vlad the Impaler, defending his land against invading Muslim Turks, but is undone by his enemies when they tell his wife that he has been killed in battle. Elizabeta is so distraught that she throws herself from a high castle window into the river below. When Dracula learns that she is damned for committing suicide he renounces the church and – the logistics are a little unclear here – becomes a vampire. Four hundred years later, Dracula discovers that his lawyer’s fiancée, Mina Murray, looks exactly like his dead wife Elizabeta, and Dracula comes to England to claim her.</p>
<p>After pursuing her in the guise of a foreign prince, he manages to get her alone, pulling her into a private room with such smoothness they appear to be gliding. In this temporary privacy he whispers to her in his own language, a dark mumbling of harsh consonants and round vowels. His teeth come out at the sight of her exposed neck but he stops just at the brink of biting her. Does his “human” nature overpower his monstrous instincts? Or is it a desire for something more than blood that stops him? Mina is more than just a physical conquest, more than just blood to be claimed; she is the exact image of his long-dead wife. It is fate that brings them back together – gliding, irresistible fate.</p>
<p>My second year at Michigan fate brought my dark one to the Midwest and we began again. It seemed easy to pick up where we had left off despite our terrible break up and the silence that followed. He was the smartest and most passionate person I had ever met and I was nineteen; I could handle whatever he dished out. We prowled Ann Arbor’s cafes and sipped yerba mattes through metal straws. We scrunched up together on my tiny red couch and read: Mary Shelley, Charlotte Bronte, Kate Chopin. When we fought – and when we loved – we often bit and scratched. Once, in the middle of the night, he went next door to stop a terrible fight we heard through the walls. More often the fight was our own.</p>
<p>At the end of my junior year I left the two-room apartment on South University in his care and spent the summer in New Hampshire. There I met someone like <em>Dracula</em>’s Quincey Morris – not a Texan, but an adventurer with a straightforward intention to do good – and his light flirtation was different enough from my dark one’s attractions that I was intrigued. For his own mysterious reasons my dark one, my D., refused to write or call me while I was away, and his silence made it easier to listen to my Quincey’s tales of kayaking the Great Lakes or winter camping on Isle Royal. Soon we were taking long walks in the woods, our pinkie fingers joined, not quite admitting to holding hands. Our last night on Lake Winnipesauke we shared a cot in the camp’s infirmary. Two days later, back in Ann Arbor, I broke up with D.</p>
<p>His reaction was bad. I spent the night at a friend’s. The next day I returned to my apartment to find that D. had moved out, but all of my book spines were marked with a smear of blood. Only a few weeks later I moved in to a one-room apartment on Church Street.</p>
<p>But I still felt tied to D. Only a year earlier, in that small apartment on South University, D. and I had agreed to marry if unmarried by thirty (which, then, seemed a lifetime away). We planned to meet in the Water Lilies room at the Museum of Modern Art on a certain date, halfway between my thirtieth birthday and his. I was still bound to him, still waiting for his call.</p>
<p>D. did call – when I was in graduate school – long after my Quincey and I had parted ways. Once I flew out to a lonely Midwest town to spend a weekend with him. It happened to be Valentine’s Day and in a gesture of irony we went to Hooters. Once, a year later, we met at a New York café, and on a street corner in Soho he picked me up, twirled me around and kissed me even though we both belonged to someone else. We always called these “moments out of time.” It seemed that in some way we would always be there for each other, that our bond was stronger than others, that we could take from each other what we needed – or wanted – regardless of others in our lives. We were each other’s future.</p>
<p>But then, at twenty-nine, I met J.</p>
<p>Within months I knew that he was the one I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. D. and I had drifted; we hadn’t talked in months if not years and I only thought of him after I turned thirty and the day of our meeting approached. But by then I had learned that the Museum of Modern Art had moved to Queens for renovation. And Monet’s Water Lilies were not in Manhattan or in their temporary home in Queens: they were packed up and in transit somewhere in between. I took this as more than a sign.</p>
<p>D. and I didn’t meet. J. proposed during a spring snowstorm in the Bishop’s Garden of the National Cathedral and I said yes. Later that month I started rereading <em>Dracula</em>.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>We first meet Jonathan Harker at the very beginning of the novel. He is on his way to Dracula’s castle, deep in the Carpathian Mountains, and he writes in his diary: “I shall enter here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my travels with Mina.” There is nothing very striking in Jonathan’s personality from these early entries; our interest is more in what he observes than in the observer himself. Later Dr. Seward is surprised at Jonathan’s appearance: “He is uncommonly clever … If his journal is true … he is also a man of great nerve … I was prepared to meet a good specimen of manhood, but hardly the quiet, business-like gentleman who came here today.”</p>
<p>When I first met J. he, too, seemed the right content in the wrong form. Instead of the particular “specimen of manhood” Seward (and I) expected, J. is my height, slightly built, more of an artist than a scholar, with green eyes and short dark blonde hair – not the tall, dark stereotype I thought I was holding out for. Just after we met I left for a two-month teaching job in New England, and our correspondence began with a post card, then a series of letters.</p>
<p>Mina, too, is a letter writer – and a teacher. But while I was getting regular missives from J., Mina receives only a “few hurried lines” from Jonathan saying that he will return in a week. But then, for months, there is silence. Now, after my own courtship of letters, and my own engagement, I can better understand Mina’s fears for her fiancé. As I read I imagined J. lost in the heart of Romania, perhaps imprisoned, perhaps ill, not speaking the language, and if he had the modern convenience of a cell phone its signal would be cut off by the Carpathian Mountains long before it reached me.</p>
<p>In the book Mina suffers in Jonathan’s long absence. The reader knows – as Mina does not – that Jonathan has been kept a prisoner in Dracula’s castle before he attempts a daring escape. But in Coppola’s movie Mina is too busy having an affair with Dracula to show any real concern. When news of Jonathan finally arrives she says to herself, “My sweet prince … Jonathan must never know of us,” and destroys her diary on her way to the convent where she and Jonathan will be married without delay – or confession. This is a huge departure from the book, where Mina’s diary and her willingness to share it becomes the key to Dracula’s undoing.</p>
<p>Because Mina compiles the characters’ private writing (Jonathan’s diary, Seward’s notes about his patient Lucy, telegrams from Seward’s mentor Van Helsing, letters between Mina and Lucy), they can read their larger story, instead of being limited to their own particular part of it, and this plays a crucial role in the understanding and ultimate defeat of Dracula. Their words save them all – when they have the right reader, and Mina is that reader.</p>
<p>But then Mina becomes Dracula’s greatest victim. With Jonathan asleep beside her, Dracula seeps into their bedroom, forcing her to drink his own blood. “You,” he says, “their best beloved one, are now to me, flesh of my flesh; blood of my blood; kin of my kin; my bountiful wine-press for awhile; and shall be later on my companion and my helper … When my brain says ‘Come!’ to you, you shall cross land or sea to do my bidding …” This is not gliding, resistless fate. This is violent, deliberate evil. Stoker’s Dracula has indeed dealt a savage blow by turning Jonathan’s “best beloved” against him – and herself.</p>
<p>This scene in Coppola’s movie is completely different. Jonathan is out destroying Dracula’s safe-house when Dracula materializes not by Mina’s bed but in it. When she wakes from her sleep she welcomes him, calling him her “love.” And Dracula loves her too. He insists on explaining who he is – “lifeless, soulless, hated and feared. I am the monster that breathing men would kill; I am Dracula” – but she still loves him. He warns her that “to walk with me you must die to your breathing life and be reborn to mine” but Mina insists, “I want to be what you are, see what you see, love what you love.” But when she starts to drink the blood from his chest he stops her. “No,” he says, “I cannot let this be … I love you too much to condemn you.” But Mina drinks willingly. In the book this was a scene of horror, an act akin to rape, but here in the film it has become the consummation of romantic love.</p>
<p>When I first saw this movie at nineteen, the idea of a dark immortality was immensely attractive. It was easy to see how Mina would prefer Dracula to Jonathan. In the book Jonathan is a respectable solicitor with unsuspected depth. He conspires to escape Dracula’s castle and succeeds. He trusts Mina with his secrets. He is a devoted husband. But in the movie Keanu Reeves portrays Jonathan as a wooden prig, which makes it all the more understandable – desirable, even – for Mina to turn away from him to answer Dracula’s call.</p>
<p>In the movie Dracula has it all – the seductive powers of a confident man as well as the supernatural powers of an immortal. And his control over Mina is intensified by predestination. Mina appears to be Dracula’s wife Elizabeta reincarnated and, with the help of Dracula’s relentless pursuit, she falls passionately in love with him (again). If I were swept away by Dracula it wouldn’t be my fault. I would be acting under forces beyond my control. I wouldn’t leave Jonathan Harker – whoever he was in my life at the time. I would be taken from him. I would be swept away by passion and fate.</p>
<p>And passion, I think, is the key. We think of passion as romantic or sexual, but its earliest usage refers to the agonies of Christ or a Christian martyr: “senses relating to physical suffering and pain.” This is especially interesting in this context, since Dracula in both the book and the movie is seen as a sort of anti-Christ. The word evolved to include both positive and negative feelings: “any strong, controlling, or overpowering emotion, as desire, hate, fear, etc.,” and this is what Dracula’s victims feel for him. They are all overpowered by him. In the movie it is out of love (in Mina’s case) or desire (in Lucy’s); in the book they are overpowered by hate and fear. Although Mina may love Jonathan and hate and fear Dracula, she is still bound to Dracula, waiting for his call. Only after the 16th century does passion become associated with love, romance and desire; it becomes a word that we are familiar with. But the third definition of “passion” may surprise us: “Senses relating to passivity … The fact or condition of being acted upon; subjection to external force; esp. … passivity (opposed to action).” “Passion” and “passive” share the same root, and it can be easy to confuse them.</p>
<p>I confused them. Time after time I gave up action and responsibility for passionate passivity, gliding, resistless, into what I thought was fate. D. and I lived outside the bounds of convention or ethics. We were entitled to our “moments out of time” no matter who they might hurt.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve found someone for whom I feel more than passion, I have a new appreciation for the selfless, active, not righteous but right love that Jonathan and Mina share in the book. And the passage that shows me this love most clearly is an entry from Jonathan’s diary: “To one thing I have made up my mind; if we find out that Mina must be a vampire in the end, then she shall not go into that unknown and terrible land alone.” Lucy’s fiancé Arthur is completely repulsed by the undead Lucy and never considers the possibility of accompanying her into that “unknown and terrible land.” Would Jonathan yield to Mina’s vampire call, even if it horrified him? Would he go with her to the land of the un-dead? This would go against everything he believes as a man and as a Christian, and yet it looks like he would. This shows me what kind of a man Jonathan really is; he is anything but the uptight prude that Keanu Reeves portrays him as. In fact, he is more of a man than Arthur and more of a man than Dracula. He would give not only his life for Mina but also his death – the kind of sacrifice that no other character is willing to make.</p>
<p>But I didn’t see any of this until now, now that I have met the man I am going to marry, a man who would follow me into the unknown. Before this, Dracula seemed like a dark savior poised to pull me out of whatever bland romance I might be trapped in, and I thought of D. in much the same way. Now, though, when I reread the book, I feel Mina’s horror when the men burst into her bedroom and pull her bloody mouth from Dracula’s breast. I feel the tremors that course through her body as she screams “Unclean, unclean!” and the guilt that sears her conscience when her husband’s hair turns white from shock.</p>
<p>Now, when I watch the movie, I find myself counting the days of Mina and Dracula’s happiness against the years of Dracula’s loneliness. Mina and Dracula spend two evenings together – one in the cinematograph, the other in the absinthe parlor – one season, perhaps – against more than four centuries of his despair. And now that I am engaged to J., a steadfast, committed, giving man, I am less intrigued by Dracula’s dark power than I am moved by Jonathan’s secret resolution to go with Mina into the darkness, if she is so called, because they wed for life, for better and worse, in sickness and health and, in this case, not even un-death would keep them apart.</p>
<p>But in the book, he doesn’t have to follow her into darkness. After a wild chase that ends at Dracula’s castle, just at the moment of sunset, Jonathan slashes Dracula’s throat while Quincey plunges a knife into his heart. Mina later writes in her diary, “It was like a miracle … before our very eyes, and almost in the drawing of a breath, the whole body crumbled into dust and passed from our sight.” Although Quincey has received a mortal wound, he claims that “it was worth it to die … The curse has passed away!” Dracula is defeated and Mina is freed from his call, restored to both herself and her husband.</p>
<p>The movie has a different ending – and a different legacy. Its chase also ends at Dracula’s castle, but Jonathan’s slash and Quincy’s stab are not enough. Instead of aiming a revolver at Dracula and his gypsy helpers, this Mina levels a rifle at her own husband. “When my time comes will you do the same for me?” she asks. In the book Mina wishes to be killed before she fully transforms into a vampire, but this Mina seems to be asking something different. Faced with the challenge in her voice and the barrel of her gun, Jonathan says no. When Arthur rushes at her with a sword, Jonathan stops him. “No,” he says, “Let them go. Our work is finished here; hers has just begun.” Perhaps there is more to this Jonathan that the film gives him credit for, but this is his last line and there is little to explain it.</p>
<p>Mina and the wounded Dracula retreat to a chapel in his castle where, after a kiss and a knife through the heart, he dies under the centuries-old painting of his younger self reaching out in a swirl of cape to catch the falling Elizabeta. After centuries apart through death and damnation they are finally reunited. It reminded me of my plans with D. to be buried side by side, to have a tube connect our coffins “to continue our conversation” in the afterlife, and to marry at thirty, to steal whatever “moments out of time” we wanted until then, to keep that call between us. However doomed it was, our love, our passion, was that strong.</p>
<p>When the book’s Mina looks back at those months of trial I imagine she will feel only gratitude that Dracula was defeated and that she has been restored. But I wonder what the movie’s Mina thinks after Dracula’s death, after the final resolving chords of the soundtrack, after the screen goes black and the credits roll, after she gathers herself and steps outside the castle gates where her husband, Jonathan, awaits her. What then?</p>
<p>As my wedding approaches I will step forward gladly with J., but I know that even through our years together, I will sometimes be haunted by the fleeting shadow of a figure in black, a glimpse of turtleneck, a drop of blood, the silence that comes before the call, reminders that I have lost something I once cherished, something I can never have again, something I will always carry with me, whether I want it or not.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>They found the hiker in the sulfur mine the week before Parker and I arrived. He had been slumped against the wall of the cave, perfectly preserved — clothes intact, hair in place — mummified by the same yellow fumes that had knocked him out.</p>
<p>My father, who had given away everything he owned and decamped to the island, remembered when the man, an American eco-tourist, disappeared. He recalled the bevy of women who floated over in the little propeller plane to oversee the search. They’d picked through the uninhabited leeward side of the island, waded into the surf at sea level, broken down doors in shacks long abandoned and tucked deep in the rainforest way up the mountain, turning up nothing.</p>
<p>As my father told the story, his blue eyes sparkled like the Caribbean Sea before us. That someone could get lost on five square miles, among less than 1,500 people. Magic, he said. Poof.</p>
<p>My father looked so different since I’d last seen him. The island air had turned his brown hair steel grey, his once pink skin the color and texture of an almond. His voice was the same, pointed and low, but his vocabulary had changed, concerned as he was now with things like hurricanes, the water level in his cistern, and whether the boat that delivered food to the island could sail today. He felt far away even as I sat beside him. I reached for Parker’s hand.</p>
<p>Walking through Windwardside, we ran into the man who’d discovered the hiker. Though we didn’t know that until after he’d walked away and two girls called out to my father, “Dr. Dykstra, Alex was the one!”</p>
<p>“The one?”</p>
<p>“The one who found the hiker!”</p>
<p>Alex was husband to one of my father’s medical students, biding his time on island by learning to scuba dive. He’d trekked to the sulfur mine with two friends. When they stumbled upon the hiker, they had been turning circles themselves, the rock walls repeating. What it must be to be lost and find death itself.</p>
<p>Not long after he moved, my father paid cash for a cottage in the local style — white clapboard, pink roof, green gingerbread. He told me that he planned to live out his life there among the banana trees, that when he could no longer haul himself up the steep stone path that led to his house, he would hire one of the local women to tend to him. Then someday, he’d said to me, you’ll have a house in the Caribbean, as if this made up for the distance between us.</p>
<p>We three hiked to the mouth of the sulfur mine ourselves one afternoon. Wended through the rainforest and onto a footpath down, down, down, to a shadeless hill that hung way out over the ocean. Before us, a panorama of sea and sky. The wind whipped around the mountain with such force that it caught in our ears, muffling the sound of the surf crashing into the rocks below.</p>
<p>My father, leaning hard on his walking stick, led us down a dusty trail around a bluff, the immovable rock of the mountain on our right, sheer rolling cliff on our left.</p>
<p>The mouth of the cave exhaled heat and burnt matches, which stung my nose and pressed on my skin even ten feet away. A sign had been pounded into the ground before it: “Sulfur mine closed until further notice.” Parker walked around it and into the cave’s maw. I followed him into the darkness and saw two options, right and left.</p>
<p>My father had told us that the hiker had had a rope he’d affixed to the outside, but that it had come untied, so when he tried to follow it back out he only found its end. He’d also heard that the hiker was found just around the first couple bends. Meaning he had been disoriented, but not really lost at all.</p>
<p>Parker started to duck down one of the branches and my heart knocked fast against my chest.</p>
<p>“Don’t.”</p>
<p>I grabbed his elbow and felt that I had saved him. Though I knew that really only you can save yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The sun was shining and it was one hundred degrees, hot, very hot, but I was drinking lots of water and feeling that I could peddle for the rest of the day and into the night. I was on the Martin Goodman trail in Toronto moving east. I had just passed the memorial to Leanne Freeman on Unwin Avenue by the Richard L. Hearn Generation Station. The memorial is an engraved stone with the words, “Death leaves a heartache no one can heal / Love leaves a memory no one can steal.” I see this memorial whenever I pass by and always imagine the carnage on the scene that day. Leanne probably didn’t even know what hit her when the bullet discharged from the gun held by Joseph Beauregard and pierced her skull. She was dumped in the middle of this street where they found her, a street deserted on that night and other nights, but one populated by bikers, like myself, and other active people during the day.</p>
<p>Suddenly, something slammed into my helmet. It wasn’t a forceful hit, but it is strong enough to knock me off balance. I fall easily but I did not fall on this day. Black wings were beating around me furiously. It was some sort of bird. There was something oddly disconcerting in having a two-and-a-half ounce creature repeatedly plunge into my head with beak and claw. The helmet I wore to protect my noggin from the impact of collisions proved a solid defense from the attack of the angry bird. I was stunned, but would be fine. For the rest of the day—for the rest of my life—I would be on the lookout for all those things that strike from out of the blue.</p>
<p>A panic attack is an internal event that strikes from out of the blue. One could be said to have had a panic attack, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed., if there is “a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort, in which four (or more) of the following symptoms developed abruptly and reached a peak within 10 minutes”: heart palpitations, rapid heart beat, sweating, shortness of breath, feeling of choking, chest pain, abdominal distress, lightheadedness, derealization (feelings of unreality), depersonalization (being detached from oneself), fear of losing control or going crazy, or a fear of dying. Panic attacks occur in 3.5 percent of the adult population in the United States and, I would presume, about the same percent of the population in Canada. They are treated, as almost every other mental event, with a combination of medication and therapy, if they are treated at all. The most common medications for the treatment of panic attacks are antidepressants (SSRIs such as Zoloft, Paxil, and Prozac) and benzodiazepines (Xanax and Klonopin). The medications may or may not work. A panic attack may or may not recur. To calm patients who have had or are having a panic attack, doctors and therapists have been known to incant that “no one has ever died of a panic attack.” While the experience may be uncomfortable, they explain, it will not cause mortal harm. This is not entirely true. A study in the Archives of General Psychiatry demonstrated that post-menopausal women who had “reported at least 1 panic attack in the previous 6 months were at increased risk of subsequent cardiovascular events….” Another study in the New England Journal of Medicine showed a link between suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in individuals who experienced panic attacks; in fact, in a random sample of almost 20,000 people in the United States “[t]wenty percent of the subjects with panic disorder and 12% of those with panic attacks had made suicide attempts.” There were also complications, according to the Journal of the American Board of Family Practice, for those who hyperventilate during a panic attack.</p>
<p>No one wants to endure a panic attack. But there are those who want their assumptions of safety challenged, those who want to feel panic’s edge, and one way to guarantee those results is to watch the films of Alfred Hitchcock. I was introduced to Alfred Hitchcock by my Aunt Patricia at a farmhouse in Northern Illinois. We would watch reruns of Alfred Hitchcock Presents and The Alfred Hitchcock Hour on, I believe, WGN Channel 9, which broadcast out of Chicago. This was a time when, weather permitting, a household in the Midwest received five channels—three local stations, 13 (ABC), 17 (NBC), 23 (CBS), and two Chicago stations, 9 (WGN) [which, in addition to Alfred Hitchcock, carried the Chicago Cubs baseball games], and Channel 11 (PBS). We purchased a TV Guide at the beginning of the week and circled or otherwise highlighted our choices so they would not be missed. This was a time before remote controls, a time when at certain hours all stations transmitted analogue snow, a time when we all had a clearer idea of how to end our days.</p>
<p>At the beginning of each program, the music of Charles Gounod’s Funeral March of a Marionette would begin, and the silhouette of Alfred Hitchcock would enter the frame from the right and flush itself with an outline of his likeness, which was in the center of the frame. The outline of Alfred Hitchcock was drawn by Hitchcock himself. “Hitchcock’s shadow within the drawing serves a literal function as an ominous warning of imminent suspense, and symbolizes the long shadow he cast over the entire production,” claims Andrew Erish in “Reclaiming Alfred Hitchcock Presents.” The camera would pan from his shadow toward an Alfred Hitchcock not in shadow, one turned to face the camera. This effect was achieved by splicing two pieces of film on a similar movement with a similar background during the camera pan. The edit was noticeable. Alfred Hitchcock would pronounce “Good Evening” and then introduce the show and its sponsors.</p>
<p>While he introduced and concluded his television series to, in his own words, “give the title to those of you who can&#8217;t read, and to tidy up afterwards for those who don&#8217;t understand the endings,” he let his motion pictures speak for themselves. In The Birds we are lead to believe that a colony of birds is out to attack citizens on a California coastal town. We are never informed why this might be the case; the aggressive manner of the birds is a mystery through to the last frame. This may be one reason the film works so well. The viewer is always trying to construct a plausible motive to the bird’s behavior. In one scene, an ornithologist in a coffee shop who explains that birds do not normally act in an aggressive manner and that “they bring beauty into the world” is the only scientific information the audience is provided, in fact. This of course heightens the mystery of the bird’s behavior. For Hitchcock knew, as we all do, that experts are frequently wrong, and that something that might be right most of the time may not be right all of the time. He would also allude to the fact that animals, even human ones, have a mind of their own, and they can perform the cruelest of acts on others. They can even love each other.</p>
<p>Real birds in Toronto do in fact attack. “Male red-wings are highly territorial, and during mating season—from May to July—they’ll fiercely defend their multiple mates and nests (they’re the polygamous players of the feathered world),” says Stephen Michalowicz in the Torontoist. “The ones that nest in cities are also more aggressive than their rural friends.” Perhaps this is why in the rural Midwest where I grew up I never suffered an airborne avian assault. The red-winged blackbirds of my youth sat on barbed-wire fence posts and trees with their distinctive yellow and red stripe. Of course, I am describing the male red-winged blackbird. The female red-winged blackbird has no red or yellow on its wings; its feather pattern is brown and speckled, like that of the sparrow. Unlike Hitchcock’s birds, the red-winged blackbird has not been known to attack en masse nor has it been known to attack with the intent to hurt. Which is another way of saying that the red-winged blackbird is not a predator, just a little fellow trying to frighten away anything that might threaten or hurt its chicks.</p>
<p>This bird event occurred a day after I experienced a horror event of my own. My partner and I had been in Montreal for a funeral and, while my partner was sleeping, I had, early in the morning, a morning when the sky was blue and the sun was shining, walked out to secure a cup of decaffeinated coffee. Our hosts did not stock coffee without caffeine. The closest coffee shop, Marché Saint-Jacques at the corner of Ontario and Amherst, was closed because of Canada Day, so I walked up to rue Sainte-Catherine, which is the main street in the gay district of Montreal. During the summer the city closes the street off to motor vehicles and strings lines of pink bulbs that extend across the breadth of the street. These bulbs give the appearance and mood of a festival or carnival and, because they are pink, reinforce the gay and lesbian ethos. As I turned onto rue Sainte-Catherine, I experienced a deep feeling of intense fear and four other symptoms that developed in an abrupt fashion. The most disturbing symptom—something between depersonalization and derealization (a technicality: there are gray lines between many states of disassociation)—was the feeling that I had lost my body. I still seemed to be a living presence, my body still seemed to be moving in a normal fashion, but the agent doing the moving, presumably me, seemed suspect. Who was I? And if my body had temporarily abdicated, what was next to go?</p>
<p>I made a quick retreat from rue Sainte-Catherine. The panic lifted as I approached the home where my partner was sleeping. I had failed in my morning mission, allowed a psychic shock to prevent me from procuring a cup of decaffeinated coffee. Instead of heading up the stairs to the home, I walked around a few nearby blocks in order to find a hole-in-the-wall diner with a yellow checkerboard floor that (gasp!) made me a cup of Sanka. Receiving brown crystals in an orange packet with some lukewarm water seemed the perfect prop to punctuate the internal episode that I would spend the rest of the day—the rest of my life—trying to figure out.</p>
<p>To experience a panic attack is to confront an existential theatre in which the stage is constantly changing or not present, and in which there are no stage directions. It is to feel unsafe with the self and with thoughts of the self. It is simultaneously to accept and reject the improbability that we are all here at this moment in time and that we will not be here at another moment in time. It is to confront that which cannot be confronted, our mortal coil. Interestingly, two days after my panic attack, the New York Times ran a lead that may hold a clue to the genesis of that coil: “Physicists Find Elusive Particle Seen as Key to Universe,” by Dennis Overbye. The particle they think they have isolated, the Higgs boson, which was generated in a high power accelerator, is believed to be a force field that provides mass to all elementary particles that pass through it. It is the medium that gives the world as we know it its form. “Without the Higgs field…all elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight.”</p>
<p>I do not understand enough about the science behind the physical world to enter into a discussion on the ways that matter may or may not act in the universe based on contact or immersion with a newly discovered field. I bring up the Higgs boson because, if physicists are on the right track, there is a definite challenge to the conditions upon which human life emerged. “The finding affirms a grand view of a universe described by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws—but one in which everything interesting, like ourselves, results from flaws or breaks in that symmetry,” Overbye writes. What it seems to be saying is that we are not here because it makes cosmic sense, but because we snuck up between the cracks, like weeds in a sidewalk. If the universe can be so described and our place in it assumed so suspect, we might acknowledge that the resulting panic attack of an individual on earth may not be an inappropriate response to our emerging grand view.</p>
<p>Hitchcock understood how tenuous the terms of our place in the universe could be. It could be bad out there. Real bad. And the social and physical hemorrhages did not necessarily need to have a scientific or other logical explanation. The moral to his stories, if there is a moral, is always obscure. Perhaps there is a clue to his morality in an experience that Hitchcock had when he was six years old. Little Alfred had committed a small crime. His father made him carry a sealed note to the police station instructing the constable on duty to lock him up in order to teach him a lesson. The officer spoke a line to Hitchcock that day that he would never forget, “This is what we do to naughty boys.” Michael Lewis in “The Canonical Alfred Hitchcock” would explain, “Biographers have stressed the fear and shame of the incident, but it is not the incarceration that is decisive. The characteristically Hitchcockian touch is that he was made to carry unwittingly the instrument of his own punishment.”</p>
<p>We might take this idea a bit further. These instruments of punishment may not need to be carried physically by the individual at all; they may exist inside of him at all times as unconscious desire. Almost a century ago, Freud would provide a theory of psychic processes that hinged on the idea of the unconscious. Freud believed that the unconscious was produced in early life from a family drama that forced the individual to suppress his most primal wishes. These wishes did not remain hidden at all times, however. They emerged, given a prompt, in the form of dreams, jokes, slips of the tongue, and symptoms, like panic attacks. It is through these channels that the individual makes himself known at certain moments, and he does it always unawares.</p>
<p>My astute partner would suggest that I do not speak the official language of Quebec, French, and that this might have made me feel more like an outsider than I might otherwise feel in a new city. This brings grammar into the equation of my particular panic attack. We might see this as a signal as to how important our language—our languages—really are as we confront each other and our environments. To not speak the language of a region forces us to use other means of communication, in the broadest definition, to partake in sign language—pointing to objects, facial expressions, picture drawing. It is to find ourselves using the tools of the silent film era while everyone else is able to indulge in modern sound and special effects techniques. We are behind, not current, outside. (This is not a judgment on the superiority of modern over silent motion pictures, only to offer that the former are opportunistic in their approach to storytelling and allow audience members more rapid access to filmic information.)</p>
<p>The red-winged blackbird that attacked me that day on the Martin Goodman trail did not hover for too long. It flew to a nearby telephone wire where it could presumably eye all those other bikers who dared pass this way. I remember thinking that I had seen those birds all my life, felt like I knew those birds. We had always lived together so peacefully. There was an urge to scream out, to try to make the bird with the red and yellow on its wing understand that I came in peace, but I knew that we spoke other languages. We were from two different parts of the animal kingdom, after all. The only thing that bound us together—Hitchcock got this right—was the violence at our cores, that atavistic pulse that resonates though all our days and nights.</p>
<p>Leanne was shot in the head and dumped on that deserted street in November 2011. Beauregard had an accomplice for the murder, but he was the one who held the weapon that ended her life. Leanne was at points a user of crystal meth and a prostitute, but she was trying to get her life back on track, trying to make it all work out. She had come here from a broken home in Winnipeg. She was twenty-three-years old. There is a framed photograph of Leanne hanging on the cyclone fence behind the stone memorial along the Martin Goodman trail. On top of the frame, secured by Scotch Tape, are two pieces of candy in cellophane wrappers. Leanne liked sweets. I would love to know why Leanne was killed, just as I would love to know why I am a person who experiences panic attacks. The one on the rue Sainte-Catherine was not the first. But the application of causality to an attack that floods all the psychic channels and produces derealization and depersonalization and a fear of going crazy and a fear of dying is entirely dependent upon the angle of one’s view. Freud might say that, through the symptom, we are always acknowledging what we really wish for. The physicist might say that our individual crises, like our place in the universe, is the result of a flaw in the cosmic fabric. Hitchcock might say that we get what we deserve. This is what we do to naughty boys. I would say that in a panic attack, like in a horror film, one is always unable to construct the proper sentence at the moment the shit hits the fan. There is only the scream, or the wish to scream.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chunking through channels at two a.m., I hit a dead zone. There’s not even static, just the black glow you see behind your eyelids. I become aware of my dark room, a little station above the night sea. I think the TV broken finally, its retina snapped. Slow aquatic taps fill the plastic casing behind the stunned screen. But no, a square of moonlit curtains floats past, smearing the dark, and now the camera is gliding close and slow, like some deep-sea rover, over taupe carpet and lingerie, then ankles, calves; the tapping resolves into sultry synth pulsing desiccated celluloid, the bass blown out. The fried-out stock flattens the bedroom murk, everything irradiated into the yokey black frizzling screen. Clunky sounds crash against the screen, stifling the synth—sheets crinkling like shower liners, kisses like Paramount punches. Everything’s delaminated, disembodied, floating loose, and the world beneath stuns me with its presence: a live feed from a decades-deep fissure where the dead float upright, Sonny Crockett’s sex scene flash-burned upon the water, the midnight sax stuck soaring in its tired genus of bluesy rapture long after the scene has wrapped, the show retired, the mansion reoccupied by its retirees, then sold to a good family, a bad one, the taupe air-conditioned carpet now dank and mildewed, clodded with pigeon shit, now ripped up, rolled, and razed with the filthy white neo-manse. Meanwhile the grips have had a hundred seafood dinners and passed on, the A.D. dead of heart attack before the eighties were quite out.</p>
<p>But now, here in the dark, time has come to nothing but water, and the feed is live: it’s all quiet on the set, while six-hundred miles north my father drags me down Crowders Creek on a tube (these moony bedroom scenes shot in daytime usually). Then she is in the shower, and when she calls out a cheery question to Sonny, who smokes in bed, exhaling across his surprisingly pale armpits, her lilt as artificial and antique as those dubbed actresses in the fifties, I know instantly that she is now dead, a mannequin in the ground, even as she stands, still, in the next chamber of this morbid Miami deco palace, her voice knocking against the walls. If I could get there, I would snap the feed and disappear forever, no matter the morbid ruins, the yellowed corpses, the Martian sun behind the curtains. The desert of the real is the most heartless but most sublime desert of all. Everyone is dead and you don’t have to look much at their eyes. A world without eyes and without words. Miami silent but for the hollow knocking of ropes against the masts.</p>
