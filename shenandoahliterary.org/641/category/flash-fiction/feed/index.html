								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Knee-deep in the yarrow and saw grass, I’m sweating it out on Old John Slade’s property. After school. 75 cents an hour. Bobby Slade cuts me a check every other Friday.</p>
<p>“Avoid running that tiller into the slops, boy,” Bobby Slade warns, handing over the key on a frayed shoelace. “You do and you’ll rue the day.”</p>
<p>Old Slade’s son inherited the property after his daddy’s passing. Bobby Slade’s dunlap blobs over his belt like Santa. Like Cranston Jones, he don’t wear a shirt more than necessary. I’ve been bigger than Cranston Jones since eighth grade. Bobby Slade’s shadow, though my height, could flatten me.</p>
<p>But I need the money. And I’ve already had my fifteenth birthday last Monday—ain’t that much time to save.</p>
<p>I nod. Careful to wheel the tiller out of the garage, safely past the drainage ditch. Swallow gas fumes all afternoon. Sweat dribbles down my back. Rivulets collect under my belt.</p>
<p>No matter. I keep prodding.</p>
<p>Mama says, “You sure are a Jones, through and through,” though everybody else says I look just like Mama. It’s the Morgan square jaw and the root beer barrel eyes. When I get this down payment together, I’m gonna be my own man. I’m gonna ask Jessa Malbeck for a Coke float at Roary’s. Jessa’s gonna sit up in my passenger seat and figure out the rest.</p>
<p>3:05, 3:15, 3:33, 3:54, 4, 4:22, 4:41, 4:50. The more I glance down at my wristwatch, the longer I take. I quit looking.</p>
<p>How’d Old Man let it get this high? How’d Bobby Slade show his face in Dehlsboro again, everyone knowing he run off with Mrs. Celia Johnston to Vicksburg. When he come back in April, no Mrs. Johnston. Everybody knows better’n to ask flat-out.</p>
<p>“Plain simple: it’s all about the money,” Mama maintains, lighting another Pal Mal, watching her stories on the tube. Cranston Jones passes through the TV room on his way to second shift, muttering something neither of us can quite make out. Mama ignores him. Drags deeper on her cig.</p>
<p>“I tell you, son, some happenings ‘round these parts are just as no-good and pleasing as what you get on the tube.”</p>
<p>I nod, figuring out the first equation, thinking of Jessa. Her red polka-dot dress. “Jim-Beau, you get the answer to seven?” she’d whispered during the algebra quiz seventh period. I didn’t know. Next time, I’ll be set.</p>
<p>It’s all about the money and Jessa, these afternoons clipping and tilling and mowing Old John Slade’s home place.</p>
<p>The whole time I’m out here, I feel Bobby Slade’s shadow bearing down on me from behind the front-facing window. How’d old guys like Bobby Slade let themselves get that way? A big Santa belly, swilling sweet tea, parked with the fan running while somebody else takes the heat. Making sure I don’t ruin his daddy’s precious machinery. Inherited a cool mill, parked behind his dead daddy’s door. I’ll never get that way.</p>
<p>But seventy-five cents an hour is still seventy-five cents an hour. “Ain’t no shame in it,” Mama says.</p>
<p>Where’d it all come from? This saw grass tangles in with the ketchy gnats gnawing away under my collar, nicking my arms and shoulder blades. Always there, just above the skin, though gone by the time I shift my hands from the sticky metal handle to swat them. Red rashes pepper my back. 5:22, 5:27, 5:33. I push, shove, sweat. No matter— for Jessa, worth it.</p>
<p>I’m working it out. I’m working: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, seventy-five cents an hour. I’m gonna get me that car. My own way.</p>
<p>From the packet of love letters Mama thought she hid in the linen closet, I know it. Sure enough from his checks: that’s Bobby Slade’s writing on them bad-hid envelopes.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These are the objects that have meant the most to me in my life:</p>
<p>1. A Stall &amp; Dean model 8141 baseball glove</p>
<p>It was the same model Ty Cobb used. Cobb’s mother killed his father as he was sneaking through the house trying to catch her in the act of infidelity. She mistook him for an intruder and shot him with a pistol. In honor of his father, Cobb played baseball like French Foreign Legion. On May 15, 1912, a man heckled Cobb from the stands, insulting his mother. After the sixth inning, Cobb went into the stands and confronted the man. The man was missing one hand completely, and the other only had three fingers. An industrial accident. Cobb beat the man almost to death. Witnesses claim that as he walked away, he said, “I don’t care if he got no feet.”</p>
<p>I dreamt I was Ty Cobb. I walked in the woods and inhaled the scent of fir as a slashing, swashbuckling despot. I was Ty Cobb catching a fish with my bare hands. I started small fires and huffed the black whorls of flame. I tied rocks to my ankles and ran as fast as I could so that when I let the rocks loose I felt like a surrogate of the wind. I bullied my shadow home under a sky of wrath. I twisted glass jars onto the heads of stray cats and broke the glass with a wrench and cat would always look at me with wild gratitude. I stole mice from the snakes and fed them to kittens. I did pushups with seven varieties of spider on my back. If I was afraid of the dark, I’d become the dark. If I walked far enough from home, and looked back, and squinted my eyes, I could imagine an Ice Age, the clouds as glaciers and my house as the landscape’s lone buffalo and I would creep up on it through the wheat as if I was Ty Cobb with a knife in his mouth, ready to disembowel the animal and sleep inside of it to keep from freezing in my very own Arctic, I, Ty Cobb, breaker of weaklings and self.</p>
<p>2. A Short History of Chemistry, J.R. Parington, 1937</p>
<p>The book was part of the west wall of the machine shed. The wall had been broken by a heifer driven mad by her weening calf howling for milk across the pasture, and my father patched the hole with rotting books roughly painted over with mortar. After a few years the books began to buckle, one volume at a time dropping to the dirt floor. This one opened directly to the periodic table. Looking at it made me feel like a miraculous collection of particles. Like I was not made of my father and mother, but the rich molecular alchemy that also made owls and the Sahara and lindens. It felt like I was reading my autobiography. I hardly understood its terms, what made a gas noble or refractory, but I knew that the world was complex beyond what I had ever suspected. In school, our science teacher had blackened fingernails and his chief concern was measuring animals through increasingly unorthodox means. One horse was 16 hands high. Another was 57 starlings long. One stray cat was thinner than a dictionary. I carried the periodic table in my back pocket for three years, until it was illegible. I dropped out of school and farmed with my father. At night we would hold our palms up to a flame to warm the pain out of our joints. The quiet of our house was enormous. “Remember children,” my teacher had said, “there is nothing in this world that you can’t measure with your hands.”</p>
<p>3. Colt 1911 series .22 Woodsman model</p>
<p>It looked like Dick Tracy’s gun, but we used it to kill vermin. I taught my wife to shoot. She could put a hole in a groundhog’s eye from fifty yards. I rode the rails in my twenties, and ever since I’ve been used to having a gun never more than a body length away. I married late, and she lasted ten years before her heart turned into a bird’s nest shredded by storm. Like the Colt, my wife had no recoil. She could look into my eyes and see the dark boss making his lists on the inside of my skull. But she slept by me, with me, and never asked questions. Her nickname for the groundhogs was “greasy citizens,” which she told me was from Shakespeare, and after she’d shoot one she’d say a little prayer under her breath that I never quite heard but it had nothing to do with forgiveness. It was my job to keep the gun clean. Hemingway said that the Woodsman would kill Joe Louis, or any horse, since what will kill a horse will kill a man. Hemingway chose to kill himself with a double-barrel 12-gauge shotgun, about which my wife, were she here now, would have told the following terrible joke and then stood up at the window to watch the deer pass like refugees into the curtain of mist beyond the orchard. “Overkill.”</p>
<p>4. Pascagoula Decoy Company Wood Mallard</p>
<p>They call it a duck blind because, once inside, you stare at the sky for so long your eyes cannot go on. There is a finite amount of blue one can take before he rejects all but the bliss of black. Below is a pond edged with ferns and brambles. In the pond there is a fake duck, which has inside of it a transmitter that emits loneliness. Other ducks that have been flying for hundreds of miles sense the lonely duck and descend. I have never used a duck call in my life. The loneliness of the wild duck is enough to bring them down. The decoy’s body is made of Tupelo wood. Its eyes are tacks. The live ducks do not come to cure the stranger, but to gather their collective loneliness in the same pond whose acoustics make of their muttering a song. They sing an ugly song together. All of the ducks take to the sky at once, all but mine. As they rise, I shoot them. The crosshairs of my gun are made from the silk of the brown recluse spider. Its loneliness is the greatest, for it can only say, Come in, Come in, Come in. I have been alone, holding my gun, for hours. This is not a type of loneliness, but rather, a type of thinking. I stare at the sky and circle high above my life. In the blind, I chronicle what I’ve seen.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Up that grade had never seemed so long, around switchbacks in and out of moonlight and cliff shadow. Doing it on a full-moon night wasn’t such a bright idea. Maybe Lance wasn’t thinking right.</p>
<p>Tilton didn’t consider that somebody might see them; he was the one who didn’t want to see. The thing in the back seat came closer every time the moon crept into the car. It drew away in the dark when the moon slid across the seat and out the window.</p>
<p>It was like he was still just thinking about doing it, what it must be like to use the hammer, but what he had thought about was done, mostly as he had imagined: the shop on the edge of the neighborhood where the open country began, the houses separated by pastures, sheds, maybe a tall board fence. Moonlight made shadow bowls out in the prairie depressions, cast barns and houses into black shade, threw its pallor over roofs and gardens.<br />
. . . . . .</p>
<p>He couldn’t take another summer in that desert mill town playing American Legion ball—sit around all day (it’s 110˚ anyway), then suit up and play away the cool of the evening with boys who couldn’t imagine doing anything else, get to bed by eleven, then practice the next morning or mow some lawns. Better that he and Lance kill Mr. Kern for the thousand dollars apiece Mrs. Kern said she was going to pay. His grand was enough to start college in the fall.</p>
<p>Mrs. Kern—Sandy—met Lance through his sister Loraine, who told Sandy that Lance was looking for work but didn’t seem like he was going to amount to anything if he didn’t go into the military so they could make him all he could be. Sandy said maybe she could find him something to do. She married Vernie Kern five years ago when he was fifty-six and she was thirty, and thirty-nine pounds heavier. They met at an Air Force Band concert in the park on Sunday afternoon. She only went there with Loraine who had to find some way to entertain her mother when she took her out from the nursing home. Vernie asked her if this music wasn’t something, and she told him it sure was. Having a boyfriend (even one who wore a bow tie) at least got the men at the bullet factory where she had worked since high school to stop joking about getting her rolling and burning up the brakes. She quit and married Vernie when he told her that his wife wouldn’t need to work. Since then, she had revived the girl she was at twenty, when she gave the men at work as good as she got on a Saturday night.</p>
<p>Tilton guessed it must be true what they said about women reaching their sexual peak at her age, cause Lance sure paid attention to her. He thought about how good she looked that morning when they met her in the park after her run, the little wet patch at the neck of her t-shirt above where it swelled out over her breasts. She told them that she would be out tonight (her friends knew her husband hated going out), so that was the time to do it. Even as hot as it was, she looked comfortable.<br />
. . . . . .</p>
<p>Sometimes when Tilton mowed the lawn, Mr. Kern took him into the house and gave him a Pepsi. Once, Mrs. Kern asked him if he didn’t want something a little stronger like she was working on. “I guess not, ma’am,” he said, “I got baseball in a little bit.”</p>
<p>“Can’t you kids find anything better to do?” she asked and tousled his hair. “You’re just like Vernie, happy to die in this hole of a town. Your buddy Lance, now, he’s got some ambition. He’d do anything to get out.” Lance told him that after this all blew over in a couple of months, he and Sandy were leaving with the old man’s money. She had it all worked out.</p>
<p>Tilton wondered if she had come home yet. She’d park her pale blue Miata in the driveway behind her husband’s Crown Vic and walk straight for the side door. She’d change her shoes, have a drink of water, then stroll to the workshop out back to find blood everywhere and her husband missing. Maybe she’d already called to report the senseless deed: Where was he? She was going crazy. Then Tilton realized they had only done it ten minutes ago. The moonlight slowed everything down.<br />
. . . . . .</p>
<p>Mr. Kern liked to tinker in his shop late at night. Summer before last he sharpened Tilton’s mower blade and said he had “put an extra-sharp edge on it to get a young fella started.” The noise of the grinding wheel made it easy to come up behind him. Tilton half expected the old guy to turn around and offer him a Pepsi. The blows made muffled thuds, like a ball landing on the warning track. He didn’t expect Mr. Kern’s little-girl sigh.</p>
<p>Then that was it. He wanted to run outside where there was no red, with the driveway shining on one side and the prairie rolling in moonlight on the other, but Lance said they had to hide the evidence—no body, no crime.</p>
<p>So here they were climbing that twisted road, and the pallid gleam came back into the car. Mr. Kern’s foot thumped against the door around the curves. Lance turned up a rutted track onto a bluff bright above the town’s dark pit of eyes. Tilton saw it was a beautiful night. None of the other guys would be up this late. Through the veil of moonlight it was like a dream that would be gone in the morning. Soon he would start college! As he got out the shovels and gave Lance a hand with Mr. Kern, even the dirt sparkled.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>That winter, the last of the war, the river froze over and stray dogs died where they lay. The scarcity of wood meant that fires could only be lit for a few hours a day. Even in the wealthy quarters people had started to break up and burn their furniture.</p>
<p>In an apartment in the 16th arrondissement a young musician called Iris Dalbert wore her overcoat and fingerless gloves as she sat at the grand piano. She couldn’t bring herself to practice; instead, she walked over to the balcony windows and looked out at the plane trees and the white rooftops. In the café opposite she could see a woman sitting between two soldiers. When the woman leant forward she recognised the smiling face of a girl she had known at school.</p>
<p>The housekeeper came in to clear away the breakfast Iris hadn’t eaten.</p>
<p>‘Is my father still here?’</p>
<p>‘He left earlier than usual.’</p>
<p>She returned to the window. The girl was leaving the café. Her mouth seemed very red in contrast to the monochrome setting. As she crossed the street she bumped into an elderly man, sending his hat flying in a gust of wind. Iris smiled, for the old man was her teacher.</p>
<p>She sat on a settee and waited. When the professor entered the room he was still cursing the young woman.</p>
<p>‘You had a lucky escape,’ Iris said, taking his hat.</p>
<p>‘Did you see?’</p>
<p>But he wasn’t one for small-talk. He pointed at the keyboard.</p>
<p>‘Let me hear.’</p>
<p>‘No, we’ve gone through these pieces a hundred times.’</p>
<p>‘We still have to decide on the piece for the encore.’</p>
<p>‘I have something in mind.’</p>
<p>‘What?’</p>
<p>‘I don’t want to say.’</p>
<p>He was struggling to come to terms with the fact that she was no longer a child. ‘This is no good. The encore is as important as the rest. But as the rest is very serious, sombre even, you should play something witty and light that will delight your audience. A Mozart or Haydn allegretto.’</p>
<p>Iris respected her teacher, and tolerated – at least in his presence – his lack of understanding of both her and of the world around them. She didn’t care to pander to the collaborators who would occupy most of the seats.</p>
<p>To get rid of the professor she agreed to play the Mozart. Soon after his departure she walked the short distance to the conservatoire. She waited in a long music-filled corridor for her friends Carole and Paul to emerge from a class. They went to their favourite café, a small hidden away place, and huddled together beside one of the heaters. She told them that she hadn’t changed her mind and that they should meet her outside the stage door immediately at the end of the performance. Carole said, ‘I don’t know.’</p>
<p>‘It will be all right. It’s a small gesture.’</p>
<p>‘They probably won’t even realise,’ Paul said.</p>
<p>They shared a packet of cigarettes. Iris hurried home in the fading light. Now that the concert was imminent she started to prepare. She sat at the piano and played a few pages of the Brahms. In her bedroom she changed into a black dress. Her father had given her a pair of stockings, but she knew where he’d got them and refused to wear them. She slipped her bare feet into a pair of expensive high-heeled shoes that had belonged to her mother.</p>
<p>The car came for her at five. In the theatre, after the necessary formalities, she walked onto the stage and faced the auditorium. Empty and red, it made her think of an open mouth. She turned to the piano. She was pleased. The instrument had been expertly tuned so that the tone was both warm and ringing. She retreated to the dressing room, and lay down on the narrow bed to rest. She was woken by the stage manager, a young woman called Teresa. ‘It’s nearly time.’</p>
<p>‘I fell asleep?’</p>
<p>‘Yes. The professor came but didn’t want to disturb you.’</p>
<p>‘And my father?’</p>
<p>‘He called. He said he’s been delayed.’</p>
<p>‘It’s just as well.’</p>
<p>‘Just as well?’</p>
<p>She went to the mirror. ‘Do I look okay?’</p>
<p>Teresa carefully re-tied Iris’s hair, and knelt to check the hem of her dress. ‘You look beautiful.’</p>
<p>Iris followed Teresa along the corridor and down a flight of stairs into the wings. She looked at the black piano, and allowed the stacked rows of figures beyond to remain faceless, only registering that each uniform, black or grey, was separated from the next by coloured cloth, skin and diamonds. As she walked out onto the stage she looked at the piano as if it represented safety, and her acknowledgement of the audience was so brief as to be cursory. Impatient, because anxious, she began to play before the audience had settled and at once her concentration on the music was so complete that all other thoughts were pushed from her mind. At the end of her programme the applause was enthusiastic. She walked off the stage. Her teacher was pleased: he kissed her on each cheek. She walked back to the piano and began her encore, the first of Mendelssohn’s Lieder ohne Worte Opus 19. About half way through she became aware of a murmur of anxiety. At the edge of her vision, she could see a blur of heads turning. She kept playing. A man in a black uniform had risen. He spoke in the manner of someone who was used to being obeyed, and the malignity of his stare was felt acutely by the slight girl who was its target. The ugliness of his foreign voice growled above the general chorus of discomfort and disapproval. ‘Disgrace&#8230; How dare you play this filth? Someone stop this Jew-loving bitch&#8230;’ She continued to the end of the piece, and then walked off. The old man, devastated and close to tears, slapped her. She pushed her way through the small gathering of theatre staff and ran down the stairs to the stage door.</p>
<p>Outside, Carole and Iris embraced and Paul gave Iris his coat. Without speaking, they headed in the direction of the river. This close to curfew the side roads were near-deserted, and dark. A youth on a bike, speeding without lamps, swerved to avoid them. The red tip of a cigarette flared in a doorway and revealed, for a moment, a gaunt face. Their sense of elation was fragile, and such encounters spooked them. On the other side of the river they entered a quarter of closed bookshops and small galleries. They stepped through a wooden doorway into a courtyard and climbed the stairs to an apartment on the fifth floor. The apartment belonged to the family of Paul’s girlfriend, Iris’s closest friend, arrested and deported to the east only a month before. The friends drank wine, but spoke few words before going to bed. Early the next morning, Iris left the others sleeping and made her way home. She felt sick but mostly numb, and it was this sense of disconnection, enhanced by the grey light and unnatural silence, that propelled her so calmly towards the cars waiting outside her building.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>He did everything he knew to do. He kept her nylons hanging over the bath. Sprayed her perfume on the sheets, the scent choking at his throat every time. Played her <em>narodna</em>, Bosnian country music tapes whenever the electricity worked. And he slow danced with what he remembered of the shape of her: wide hips from the children she bore him, space for her full bosom, his hand clutched over the arc of her hand.</p>
<p>He tells himself that she’s just gone to live with Boban, like she always threatened she’d do. Boban brought her roses and cried at their wedding from the back pew, while Salko was the one who stood before the altar with her and stroked her tummy, carrying what would soon be theirs. He ran the bakeries for his father and father’s father to give her something sweet to do, keep her from thinking about Boban two streets over and what her life could be. And Salko never knew if it was a bus or a bomb that took her but he leaves the nylons and sprays the perfume so her life in Mostar, in their apartment won’t have to be resurrected because, save all senses but touch, it has been kept very much alive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left">What had started as sheltering in place when the siege began and continued when rumors of the bridges’ destruction swirled into the summer, fall, and now winter now had Slavinka beginning to think that Boban was getting the wrong idea. He always brought the tea, kept keys to the basement exit and entrance locks, swore no path in the city was safe. And for a while the shelling and the screams in the night backed him up. But Slavinka was finding Boban’s touch on her shoulder too friendly for the circumstances, his gaze below respectability. She begins to note in her mind things like the timing of the shelling and Boban’s bathroom breaks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Salko has taken to the streets. To blend with the night in the illusion of safety, he borrows a black robe from the Mačeks’ youngest boy. Salko is slow enough he figures nighttime shooters might mistake him for a tree or only rubble. Only he forgets the shooters are also neighbors, friends, proprietors, and the army that is supposed to protect him. And they all know his shape and step well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By spring, Slavinka starts to look for weapons to slit Boban’s throat. Not just because he forced himself on her while his mother pretended to sleep facing the wall in the opposite corner. But because Slavinka hasn’t seen the sun in months and the kind of madness caused by the consistent loss of light sheds layers of graces and habits, one by one, as if part of a perennial skinning of man. Politeness and gratitude for shelter reveal themselves as masks and Slavinka’s mind froths: she wants to get on to the dying or the killing. Boban doesn’t look at her now and his hands return to their pocket swift after handing her the tea. And she’s not sure if it is by accident that he drops those keys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The accordion in old Arsen Dedić songs croon in Salko’s memory. He doesn’t catch himself singing ‘Bit Ces Ujivek Moja’—You’ll Always Be Mine—until a woman holding against the side of his apartment building hisses at him. He leans forward and curses her. What good are these days if you are denied wife, a living, a home, <em>and</em> a song? When the woman throws a thick ring of keys at Salko’s elbow he hisses back the equivalent of Get laid, woman, get fucked, words he was saving for the enemy if they ever approached and he could ever sort out exactly who it is in the new dark of Bosnian nights that isn’t on his side. She cries beneath the tree while Salko sings an old love song, shuffling his hip with each new line, building the orchestra in his head and reaching to dance with the shape of his wife.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>F</strong>lathead Screwdriver<br />
Highway 93 took its frenulum curve between the jaws of the Mission Mountains, down the valleys throat to the southernmost reaches of Flathead Lake. Polson, Montana. It was a little after ten in the morning. The day was a clear blue over the mountains, pine char tinted the air, the continuous lapping of water drummed the shores, and his skull caved at the left orbital, the impact causing linear fractures through the sphenoid and temporal bones of his skull. His lungs had cooled, filled with the clear cold water that made the lake appear deceptively shallow. At any point, out there in a boat, the bottom seemed only a little more than ten feet deep, the trout swimming below, a good two feet long. It was a joke that locals played on tourists that ended tragically ate least once every three years. It was the floor that the young men and women were seeing, and the fish, too. But the bottom that they were sure that they could reach could be as deep as 370 feet. The good-sized trout? 40 inches and 38 pounds. It was always the ones that felt that they had the most to prove to the Montanans that drowned. The locals were tough boys and girls, some without a pot to piss in, but still commanded respect by smoking and drinking and dipping, gutting fish or guiding an outboard motor. They were all good looking, too, and most times, they could get a tourist, thirsting to be let into their mangy pack, to go against their better judgment.</p>
<p>This wasn’t Bull Child, though. He had raised the pack on the Salish-Kootenai just south, and there wasn’t a kid in the parts who didn’t owe him a favor in one fashion or another. He had warned us, though, asked us to come up the night before. Me and Keebles had gotten an early start into things and didn’t make it out the door, and if we had, would have ended up in a ditch alongside Highway 93 with the rigging of some asshole’s sailboat threading our guts, the poop deck having sliced us in twain. Road’s bad enough sober. We told Bull Child to wait. All of us were suspicious about the excess and extent of the threats that had been made. Figured whoever it was that was talking was talking pure bullshit. Then we claimed his body. No one expects things to go that far.</p>
<p>Bull Child was on a steel pan in the Polson morgue. The doctor opened a square metal door and wheeled him out. He had long red welts on his throat.</p>
<p>“Tried to cut his throat with something metallic,” Officer Butterfly said. “Must have been kind of dull.”</p>
<p>Keebles felt along the ridges running from Bull Child’s Adam’s apple to his ear lobe. There were five scrapes, progressively deeper. When the skin didn’t open, they dumped him unconscious in the lake.</p>
<p>“The official cause of death is drowning,” the man in the white coat, presumably a doctor, said, though he hadn’t introduced himself. “But he probably would have died of exposure. It dropped down to 28 last night.”</p>
<p>The doctor boasted the temperature like the harshness of the climate was amusing, or reassuring in some way. He was right. You could always depend on it being cold.</p>
<p>“His mother wants him cremated,” I said. “You can call his father for money. He lives in Big Fork.”</p>
<p>I touched Bull Child’s forehead, and it was not yet as cold as I would have guessed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Bull Child’s sister, Dovegirl, was where we thought she would be, and when we came in the door she threw a plate at us before Keebles tackled her. He restrained her by holding her firmly, as he rolled into the shards of ceramic on the floor. He didn’t hurt her, and she calmed down then, held in his arms like a wounded animal, her fight spent, needing the help. She put on some clothes. She splashed water on her face. She ran a wet comb through her hair, and told us to head northwest, toward Kalispell.</p>
<p>They were staying at the roadside motel farther up 93 with the huge neon sign, a cowboy lassoing the words El Rancho. The motel was a memory of the people that used to visit that far south of Whitefish. The land was marshy on the west side of Flathead and tourists hadn’t bought it all up yet. They used to visit to tell stories about the ranches with cattle. But the ranches disappeared into the isolation and the mountains because the ranchers couldn’t stop the cows from shitting, the shit from attracting the flies, and the flies from biting the arms of the tourists who would not remove the fingers that blocked the stench from their noses. The Missions were still set there like the teeth of a terrible trap, serrated all around us, waiting for the pressure to set them off. Keebles thread a rag around a wire coat hanger and stuffed it into their gas tank. He lit their car on fire. When they came through the door, Keebles stabbed the first one in the chest with the screwdriver he kept in the glove box. It glanced of a rib and ripped out a string of oblique muscle. The man dropped. The second man ran back into the hotel room. It was dusk, and the frost forming on the vinyl ceiling of the foyer melted next to the rim of light that heated it. For whatever reason when the man in the motel room took up his baseball bat, he decided, first, to send the glass out of the motel window like shot gun spray. We stepped back and he came after us, swung hard up and down, up and down, and brought the bat down into the asphalt. The lot chipped and scratched skin from Dovegirl’s cheek. Keebles stabbed the man in the face. The blade glanced off of the man’s forehead, turned Keeble’s wrist, and tore the shank downward, into the fat of the man’s cheek. The man dropped the bat and started screaming, the screwdriver threaded through his face like an upholstery needle. The blood gleaked out and then flowed when he pulled it out. Dovegirl spit on him. We didn’t have it in us to do any more than that. As if that wasn’t bad enough.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>llen Wrench<br />
We had made some noise up on the Res when we heard that some transplants had taken a shine to Dovegirl. It started with lurid texts, dick pics and such, and ended up with three tank tops on top of her in the bathroom of The Rose before the bouncer broke the door down. She had been holed up in her basement, afraid to go outside since then. They said they would kill her if she said anything. She knew of girls getting roughed up around the Res. Roofies. Threats. She heard about it all happening as far away as Missoula, and as close as Ronan and Polson. If it could happen in those places, where girls weren’t always brown and some even had money, then it sure as shit could happen on the Res. So we lifted a few door handles and left what was inside a bit worse for wear. But we left it alone after that, figured it was over. That’s how it usually goes. At the worst, someone comes looking for us in Missoula and then it ends. But this type of escalation? Bull Child dead. Keebles stabbing up those dudes? My hands dampened. I was assembling a desk that we had repoed from one of UM’s dumpsters when Keebles came into tell me the men from the motel had lived. We weren’t killers. I thought about that then, sitting in my room, that we weren’t killers. We had been afraid to call at first, wondering at our own accountability, but had eventually called Officer Butterfly to tell him where the men were located, and what we had done to them.</p>
<p>“They’re still filing reports,” Keebles said. “For them.”</p>
<p>“For us, too?” I asked.</p>
<p>I fit the torque wrench’s hexagon head into a screw and turned until the head stripped out, and then grabbed another.</p>
<p><strong>S</strong>tar Head Screwdriver<br />
Who knows why we do anything? If anyone would have told me when I was twenty-seven that I was going to die out on Tarkio Road under the stars one dry fall evening I would have called bullshit. I am destined for greater things. I wanted to do greater things. But my not wanting it this way doesn’t keep me from clutching a handful of dirt and coming up with rust in my fingernails as Montana’s famous sky tightens slowly down on me. All those stars seem to slowly pivot, and I swear I can see the bottom. My head is not quite sound. My jaw feels wet. Who knows when death starts? All of the actions involved in it, one minute to the next? For example, I don’t even know these people and then, there they are, that first domino has been flicked and I am waiting to see the pattern the falling tiles make. Waiting for what inevitability shapes into. The door shuttered into the kitchen and vibrated so hard that it came off its hinges. I through a bag of flour, and before the pipe hit I laughed at the man, his beard frocked, his skin antiqued, and his wet eyes, reddened slits like those of an albino rat. We avoid existential thoughts because they are constant with this world, and anxiety inducing if not just unoriginal. And so we focus on matter. On the really real of things.</p>
<p>I had never heard the sound of a door breaking open. Never felt a knife rip into my ribs while swooning in a slick of my own blood. I have never felt helpless. There was a car ride, the tires ticking cracked interstate asphalt, and crunching gravel. The trunk opened. The air was cold and the moon bright. Everything felt crisp. They stood me up in the road and drove a shank into my groin. It grazed my pelvis. They let me drop to the road, and the blood is warm. I worry about Keebles. I laugh a little about the first men that try to touch him, and I wonder whose hands will search through their own blood for the answers to the riddles that they have made for themselves here, tonight, at the end of their lives? What will they scribe in the widening pools with their fingertips as the blood starts to thicken? Who will end up in the dirt, and what ground will the bodies fall on? Where will soil and blood be rinsed from knuckles and spades? What is this tension that builds in the chest; that slips so assuredly from between the teeth? Where does it go? Why do we try to save each other?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a long walk the two girls, named Lib and Jenny, began to get hot and sweaty, their sunburned faces dripping, so they took to walking in the ocean up to their knees. It was the first Saturday in April, so the water was still very cold, but after awhile even the water didn’t cool them down. They began talking of going all the way in. The beach was deserted at the north end, just one old motel, so no one would see.</p>
<p>“Let’s swim in our clothes,” Lib said, “it’ll be fun.”</p>
<p>She grabbed Jenny’s hand, and they ran squealing into the first set of waves, their skin suddenly goose-bumped, their hearts pounding. Lib lifted Jenny’s arm as they leapt together over a rough wave, then she lowered her down again, forcing her briefly under. Jenny came up sputtering, laughing, and they both went under—they were fully in now—so they let the water come up to their necks, their hair floating.</p>
<p>Soon Jenny began to complain that her shorts had stuck to her thighs, she wanted to undress. She stood and began unzipping, pushing her shorts down over her ankles, and then she pulled her t-shirt over her head. The cold sea slapped her nude belly. Lib squirmed out of her clothes too, keeping on her bra and panties, and she waved her t-shirt like a flag.</p>
<p>Back down the beach, where the rest of the church group lay sunning themselves and listening to a radio, no one missed them. They’d had breakfast followed by a devotional, and now it was free time.</p>
<p>A patrol of brown pelicans flew low over the ocean. From where he stood behind the glass door to his motel room, Davie Ellis watched them. Big brown birds. He blinked hard. Hueys coming in, a nine-ship lift in the jungle heat. He blinked again. Birds first, then choppers, then birds. He pulled back the door to his room, stepped out into the sand and saw: girls.</p>
<p>On the golf course earlier, the sun had burned his retina, leaving a fiery orange blot in his eye every time he blinked. He’d tried to see through the blot long enough to hit the ball down the fairway, but the more he blinked, the brighter the blot became. When the pin flag became a flare, he knew he was still a sick man. Even a golf vacation was fucking Vietnam.</p>
<p>The two girls were waving something. He should call his buddy Ned, now mixing drinks, but he didn’t want to share this. Not yet, anyway: the pale white skin, the wet long hair, the slender waving arms. He stepped back into the room to pour tequila over the melting ice in his glass. He gulped it down.</p>
<p>Out in the ocean, Jenny had had enough of swimming. “Oh gosh,” she said, “oh gosh, I’m freezing!” Lib looked at her and took her hand. “Your lips are blue, let’s get out.” They splashed onto the beach, where the cold air hit them.</p>
<p>Ned appeared at Davie’s room door grinning like a fool. He held a plastic pitcher in his hand. His own poison. “Jug monkey!”</p>
<p>Davie ignored him and kept watching the girls, who now stood face to face on the beach.</p>
<p>“Dang,” Ned said.</p>
<p>Davie felt himself reel.</p>
<p>“They’re almost naked.”</p>
<p>Davie took the pitcher from Ned’s hand, the odor of Evercleer and grape juice filling his nostrils. Hoping to clear his mind, he tilted the pitcher and drank.</p>
<p>Ned grinned. “What those girls need is a towel.”</p>
<p>Davie watched him go to the bathroom and bring out two skimpy white towels. Then he watched him head out toward the beach. Yellow shorts, madras shirt, thin calves, a bald patch.</p>
<p>He tilted the pitcher again and felt the jug monkey burn. Outside on the first dune sea oats swayed. Through blurry eyes he saw himself humping through swamp grass over a flattened trail. The air conditioning unit revved up: mortar fire.</p>
<p>Here came the girls. Somehow, between Ned taking them the towels and their walk to the motel, they’d slipped their wet clothes back on, everything see-through.</p>
<p>“Look what the cat brought in!” Ned proclaimed. “It’s party time.”</p>
<p>Davie bit his lip and smiled, and the girls half-smiled back. Shy or maybe afraid. And so young. When Ned held out his arm to show them into the room, they ducked as if entering a tent.</p>
<p>At this, Davie was a goner, shit-scared and running back to the rotten hooch the platoon passed a half-hour ago, escaping mortar rounds. He ducked into the dark doorway, his M-16 out in front of him, and found a girl. By herself, just this one girl. She opened her mouth to scream, but instead of shooting he shoved her against the thatched wall. Then he fell on her.</p>
<p>“Want a little drink?” Ned led one of the girls over to the sink, his hand low on her back. She walked warily, whispering a name. “Lib?”</p>
<p>What happened next in the hooch he could never allow himself to see. It was a blot in his vision he’d put there himself.</p>
<p>Suddenly the room announced itself to him: nubby polyester bedspreads, yellowed sheets, a banged-up Motorola TV suspended from the ceiling so no one could steal it. And standing next to the door, muttering to herself, a pretty girl dressed in wet shorts and a clinging t-shirt, barefooted. A thoroughly American girl, and he had not touched her. At this, he began to sob.</p>
<p>Later that night, the girls would say it was prayer that saved them from the men. One of the men began to cry for some reason. It was a miracle. God had intervened.</p>
