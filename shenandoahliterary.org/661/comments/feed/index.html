					<description><![CDATA[This piece is hilarious! I love how ludicrous the situation is, and how the competitiveness of these two men is enough to keep them glued to their seats. The aimless gondola floating through the square was just the cherry on top. The absurdity of it all reminded me very much of many short stories written by the likes of Roald Dahl. A wonderful story indeed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is such an alluring, provocative piece. I love how the passion the poet expresses parallels so well with the details of the men, from the mud and mulch to the dirt clinging to their shoes. A powerful poem indeed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Laurel. My wife and I visited Venice, Florence, and Rome on a Rick Steves tour a couple of years ago, and I wrote a flash set in each city to commemorate the trip. I liked Venice the most and would move there tomorrow if I could afford it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a humorous and intriguing story! The characters are so vivid and the dialogue is captivating and real. The competitive aspect of their friendship adds enough tension to ground the absurd scene.The slow deluge creates a mounting sense of suspense that spills into the conclusion. Thank you for such a delightful example of flash fiction.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A raw exploration of grief and anger told in a direct but sympathetic manner. The dichotomy of the sisters highlights Denise&#039;s anger while the inner monologues show the all-encompassing effect of grief. The descriptions are just strange enough to grab my attention while also perfectly portraying the situation. The character development is magnificent, making readers side with Denise even at her lowest point.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Holly Hunt does an incredible job with a 12-year-old girl&#039;s grieving diction, while still using the third person narrative to incorporate the inner dialogue of the father, younger sister and (absence of) the mother. I especially like the allegory of the tiny rocks that Denise places in her socks that find a use later, representing the process of her grief after the abandonment of her mother. As Zan Jarvis said above, &quot;Looking at the genesis of someone else&#039;s pain makes me consider the origins of my own.&quot; This digs deep inside me, searching for my own child within.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow. This is a masterful close reading of a selection of Claudia Emerson&#039;s poems. I have never read work by her and I think that if I had, I would have missed out on its craft without Philip Belcher&#039;s analysis and commentary. When I read &quot;Elevator Operator,&quot; I did not even pick up on the subject of the poem - the black woman who operates the elevator, who is a stark contrast to the white female shoppers that she transports. It reflects the whole point of her invisibility, which makes me wonder if I am that affected by my own white, privileged blindness, or if I was just manipulated by Emerson, to reflect that all along. 

The broken, stair-step line structure of &quot;Virginia Christian&quot; is interesting because I&#039;ve always had a problem truly deciphering it. But Belcher clears all that up by interpreting it as a a representation of the carried motion of the events, beyond the control of Christian because of who she is. Belcher&#039;s reading of the characterization of the poem&#039;s subject is refreshing: &quot;She will quickly gather, however, that race in this poem cannot be viewed in isolation from gender.&quot; Intersectionality of identity is something we study in my Women&#039;s, Gender and Sexuality Studies and I love when I see academic and literary crossovers (which I think is a goal of Belcher&#039;s piece here).

I definitely want to read more Emerson because of this and Belcher has started a seed in me for truly getting at her meaning.]]></description>
