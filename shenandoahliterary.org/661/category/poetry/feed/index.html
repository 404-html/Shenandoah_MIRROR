<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have loved men who love dirt,<br />
who stump the hand-plow deep in earth,<br />
tilt and twist it, testing whether this year’s toil<br />
will break their backs or open wet and loose,</p>
<p>men who lift gift bags of baby okra,<br />
corn for stripping and nibbling,<br />
men shining with sweat, dirt clinging<br />
to shoes, to shorts I yearn to remove,</p>
<p>men who thrust their hands in soil,<br />
finger the hole, fill and tamp it,<br />
men whose minds envision a bed,<br />
purple and yellow, crocus, iris,</p>
<p>bashful men, who come exposing<br />
their failing hearts, red tulips sunk<br />
in mossed earthen pots laced<br />
in maroon and green wild calla leaves,</p>
<p>men whose cars stay stuffed<br />
with clumps of mud and mulch,<br />
who prune with knives and clippers.<br />
Men who angle against time:</p>
<p>two lie boxed<br />
inside the dirt they worked,<br />
a third one slants.&nbsp; I, too, lean,<br />
edging toward earth.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Fincastle, Virginia: 1808</em></p>
<p>When trees cast their shadows<br />
in a long line, their gathered shade</p>
<p>brushing the nearest tree’s trunk<br />
&amp; branches, they may be cleared</p>
<p>in a single roiling wave. Cuts<br />
must be well-placed. The wedged</p>
<p>mouth of the notch determines<br />
direction of fall, heartwood collapsing</p>
<p>against itself upon vacant space<br />
until the hinge tears, &amp; the first tree</p>
<p>goes, forcing down the next,<br />
&amp; the next’s deep weight dragging</p>
<p>under its neighbor like drowning men,<br />
all husked &amp; stripped, limbs</p>
<p>like severed things, heart bucked into<br />
pieces inside the flesh’s splintered calm.</p>

<p>St. Louis, Missouri, 1810</p>
<p><em>I thank providence for directing the whale to us; and think Him much more kind to us than he was to Jonah, having Sent this monster to be Swallowed by us in Sted of Swallowing of us as jonah’s did</em>.<br />
– William Clark, January 10, 1805 Journal Entry</p>
<p>The curved breast<br />
of the carcass like a ship,<br />
its great beaked head<br />
beached. You arrived<br />
too late for harvesting<br />
much, a bit of blubber<br />
to season with salt<br />
boiled on the cragged,<br />
fog-shucked shore,<br />
&amp; a splash of oil, lighting<br />
a few wet nights. Into<br />
the darkness where<br />
the beast was born<br />
flows the river where you<br />
forgot my name, gifting<br />
it to the girl only a father<br />
ever summoned as <em>Judith.</em><br />
Forgivable, like most sins<br />
of omission,  for a man<br />
who  knew only<br />
the obedient child, the one<br />
trying to swallow<br />
the vastness of it: memory’s<br />
cold sinew, western sky,<br />
whale, the will of a lord<br />
who strands what he made.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>St. Louis, 1812</em></p>
<p>In town, chimneys fall<br />
like wasps’ nests</p>
<p>broomed from eaves.<br />
The bricked streets chasm</p>
<p>into maws. Bells rang<br />
as far away as Boston,</p>
<p>the papers claim, whole<br />
forests dragged into</p>
<p>fissures, the big muddy<br />
calved &amp; stalling around</p>
<p>newborn islands, riverboats<br />
adrift like hickory leaves</p>
<p>on the backwards current.<br />
Some say Tecumseh has put</p>
<p>his foot down, and who<br />
could blame him. But I ask</p>
<p>if it may be only the earth<br />
straining to snare her trail,</p>
<p>that promised, unending<br />
orb she must keep, wobbling</p>
<p>as she goes, covetous<br />
yet of the light’s leap.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having accidentally thrown out their decade old sourdough culture, the bakers at Park Avenue come to my friend Nick at the Sweet Grass &amp; ask, can he find it in his heart to share a dollop of starter with them, but though he is kind about it, though he says, ask me for sugar, for flour, for honey brewed by bees from high mountain meadows beyond the valley, no, he cannot give them a bit of the batter that dwells in a plastic bucket by his rusty ovens, birthed 150 years ago in the windy darkness of a kitchen in Great Falls at the hands of a Scotch sheepherder plying yeast with water, with wheat that bloomed &amp; died in the surrounding plains, risen from the wild, the dough a thing with breath, souring into a richness he feeds, &amp; folds, hungrily alive in his long freckled hands, like the voice blazing in a coal worn in a bag below the throat, talisman &amp; torch, the voice that gives the price for day-old bread, the voice vowing the simple, leavening power of its love, the voice of some god howling year after year among the trees.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Heart of my innermost doll-child;<br />
heart of petit fours on a tray;<br />
you are a bonfire upon which<br />
children spit, waiting for their ride<br />
back from the Museum of Science<br />
and Industry, where they espy<br />
an interactive coalmine, and<br />
the U505 submarine, on display.<br />
Upstart heart, totemic crow.<br />
We await your circumspect vows.<br />
We acknowledge your slow bleed.<br />
We demand to know, are we the chosen:<br />
will we be present when you’re crowned<br />
Queen of Nuclear Fallout, secret weapon<br />
of the late empire’s last lovers, détente.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?”<br />
&#8212; <em>Twelfth Night</em></p>
<p><em> </em>It’s not all cakes and ale.<br />
Sometimes it’s ale and cakes.<br />
At least one of us knew his ale and cakes.<br />
He could poach your deer<br />
to accompany your ale and cakes.<br />
He could hold up his side<br />
in a knife-in-your-eye tavern fight.<br />
Ale will give you courage.<br />
Cake will give you cake.<br />
So have some cake.  With ale.<br />
Sing happy birthday<br />
to your birthday cake<br />
Your virtue’s not meant to span<br />
from cradle to grave,<br />
not when you’re made of cake,<br />
and not when you’re made of ale.<br />
It’s not all cakes and ale.<br />
It’s not all suffering.<br />
So much is made of cake.<br />
The ale takes care of itself.<br />
It’s not all cakes and ale.<br />
Sometimes it’s ale and cakes.<br />
Virtue is often faked. You ought to know.<br />
There are more things in a bar or a bakery,<br />
than are dreamt of<br />
in your theocracy.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>For JR</em></p>
<p>One can leap from a pulpit in a suit of feathers<br />
or march on Washington. Only a maniac gives his life<br />
without dying if you count each war stopped,<br />
all the years of perseverating you didn&#8217;t believe in it<br />
like UFOs or ghosts.<br />
You had to love the corny<br />
togetherness of barbershop quartets<br />
more than Jesus did<br />
to take on everyone, a one-way mission<br />
to old age where you forget the Alamo,<br />
not just saying it, and no one bothers you<br />
and you don&#8217;t bother them, drifting off watching the news,<br />
the world still bodies are to fields what nails are to hands.<br />
If you snore instead of coo<br />
breathing still offers a basic sermon<br />
on flags folded into triangles<br />
and you always were less a bird than an ass<br />
like the one Christ rode,<br />
or just a weed blooming at Gethsemane,<br />
nothing to show for sticking it out<br />
but a little peace found, found again.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“The Birnam Oak and its neighbour the Birnam Sycamore are thought to be the sole surviving trees of the great forest that once straddled the banks and hillsides of the River Tay. This forest is celebrated in Shakespeare&#8217;s <em>Macbeth</em> as the famous Birnam Wood.”  –<em>Visit Scotland</em> website</p>
<p>Just as three witches whistled past,<br />
their hems crusted with leaves,<br />
the oak opened to hide me.</p>
<p>Not age or disease<br />
punched a hollow into the oak<br />
when the birds left their nests</p>
<p>and the woods rose over the hill.<br />
Soon enough Macbeth’s head<br />
turned up on a stick&#8211;</p>
<p>that was politics.  That’s always<br />
politics: somebody<br />
can’t figure out what words mean.</p>
<p>When it rained the oak sizzled<br />
like a log on a fire,<br />
and I was stuck.  Some trick.</p>
<p>In another storm of ink I was freed.<br />
How close to the forest<br />
those writers were.</p>
<p>They each wrote<br />
with a feather.<br />
One of them put out words like leaves.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The grandmother smiled like sleep<br />
in the way jaws sag and rooms smell like the past.<br />
But her familiar face merely embellished<br />
a nightie worn by death itself,<br />
which mistook you for why you came<br />
like a forest whatever&#8217;s in it,<br />
and no one objected in time. Sometimes red<br />
is just refused light, has nothing to do with desire,<br />
Your wore a sweatshirt. Maybe it had a cowl.<br />
Maybe it didn&#8217;t, endless analysis<br />
the fairy tale. Your skinned knees forgave what they forgot<br />
by healing, but not that look.<br />
She had no teeth and her hands told yours<br />
what nice hands. But if she gasped and her eyes widened<br />
they could also swallow, wanted the flowers<br />
you brought and the walls and the lobby,<br />
a street full of taxis, the sky in every day since.</p>
