								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Artist Statement: </em></p>
<p><em>            My work inhabits that elusive place where memory and reality overlap. With a concern for light and atmosphere, I lift elements from their otherwise quotidian context and elevate them to into the realm of icon. By capturing moments in time the way one remembers them – in fragments that hint at an underlying narrative – the intention is to create visual allegories that are intriguing and evocative</em><em>. </em></p>
<p>Brief Biography:</p>
<p>Linda Burgess is an artist and writer whose career spans more than three decades. She has exhibited in galleries and museums in throughout the U. S., and in Europe and Japan.  The National Museum of Women in the Arts, The Mint Museum of Art, The Polaroid International Collection, Zimmerli Museum of Art, and McGraw-Hill Publishing are among the many public and corporate collections in which her work can be found.  In addition to writing about art for <em>Art &amp; Antiques</em>, <em>ARTnews</em>, and <em>The Washington Review</em>, she is the author of <em><u>Mount Vernon’s Magnificent Menagerie and the Very Mysterious Guest</u></em>, a children’s book about George Washington’s animals illustrated by her daughter and artist, Maggie Dunlap.</p>
<p>Burgess received a BA in art and music from Appalachian State University, and an MFA in painting from Rutgers University, where she studied with Leon Golub. As an Associate Professor of Art, she taught painting at Birmingham-Southern College, and in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia as an Adjunct Professor with the University of New Haven.</p>
<p>More of her work can be viewed at <a href="http://lindaburgess.com">lindaburgess.com</a>.</p>
<p>Editor&#8217;s Note: I decided not to include a brief analysis of Linda&#8217;s paintings, as for once I&#8217;m heeding some of Barry Lopez&#8217;s wisdom: &#8220;The proper response to mystery is awe, not analysis.&#8221;</p>
