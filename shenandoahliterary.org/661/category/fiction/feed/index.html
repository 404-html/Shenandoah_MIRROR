								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My wife, Alicia, told me that she never knew that she could swim until six years into her first marriage.  We sat on a nice well-stained second-floor porch at a lake rental house, thirty miles from where we lived, overlooking a cove.  Down below us floated a dock, a pontoon boat, a metal canoe painted green, and across the water only one other house stood in view. I’d gotten the place free for the long weekend, as long as I set the place up for wi-fi and figured out how to get these people’s entertainment system to work.  My job was to type up and print out a step-by-step process so future vacationers could come to a lake house surrounded by Nature, then have no problem getting on-line, or watching endless movies on those Premium channels.  Normally I’d’ve said something about how I needed payment, that I didn’t need a four-day weekend at the lake, that unfortunately I couldn’t barter with Duke Power, Piedmont Gas, or whoever my mortgage lender happened to be this year.  But Alicia probably needed some time away.  She felt as though she might be on the verge of a nervous breakdown, and had walked off her last job two weeks earlier.</p>
<p>“Because my father moved around so much in the Army, I never got the chance to learn how to swim,” Alicia said.  “It seemed like every summer he got stationed in places without lakes or pools.”</p>
<p>We’d gotten in at noon and unpacked our bags in the master bedroom.  This place had four single beds downstairs, two queen sized-beds on the main floor, and then another two beds upstairs in a crow’s nest.  The owner of the lake house, Carnell Henderson&#8211;he’d hired me out to run some cable from his house to his wife’s new greenhouse, and while I was there he asked if I knew computers, and so on. I kind of lied.  I mean, I knew that I could figure things out, but it’s not like I have an associate’s degree in computer science or electronics.  Me, I had a regular bachelor’s degree in psychology, plus a grandfather and father who worked as electricians and taught me the trade. I told Carnell no problem.  He made a point to tell me this investment property of his normally pulled in fifteen hundred dollars.  I didn’t ask him if that meant nightly, long-weekendly, weekly, or monthly.  I didn’t care.  He sounded like a landlord more than anything else, and maybe I held bad memories of landlords back before my second marriage.</p>
<p>Psychology ended up being a perfect degree for my future job as an electrician.  I had no fear of mice or rats living deep in crawl spaces.</p>
<p>I poured some wine into Alicia’s glass&#8211;we’d brought two coolers filled with chicken wings, catfish, pork chops, hamburger meat, and veggie burgers should we finally decide to go healthy&#8211;and got up to get myself the bottle of Four Roses.  We had kale, and early first-harvest cucumbers, tomatoes, squash, and jalapenos from our own garden.  I’d gone by the Bi-Lo on the way out and gotten corn, charcoal briquets, and lighter fluid. I bought four different six-packs of fancy beer I’d never heard of. Listen, if we’d had this lake house for a month we’d’ve had enough food and booze, is what I’m saying.  We brought along pumpernickel, rye, sour dough, and French bread.  Edam, cheddar, and brie.  Three bags of Doritos.  French onion and bean dip. Salsa. Hummus. Alicia’s eight bottles of Merlot and Rosé. Two fifths of bourbon.</p>
<p>My second wife pulled her legs up and set them across mine.  She wore a green and white sundress adorned with monkeys all linked together hand-by-hand swinging, like that Barrel of Monkeys kids’ game.  I’m not sure where she got it.  This might sound mean, but I was glad we had all that food and didn’t need to go out to a local restaurant, if there were any nearby. Alicia looked like a regular woman worried about her appearance in many ways&#8211;she dyed her shortish hair and worked a treadmill most mornings before dawn&#8211;but sometimes she chose to clothe herself in get-ups she thought either chic, suave, or hipsterish that I didn’t see other women our age wear when I showed up to keep their houses from sparking on fire. I picked up a pair of binoculars left out on the table and looked out at someone doing figure 8s with a jet ski in the lake’s main channel.</p>
<p>“I didn’t even care about swimming.  I never thought about it!  And then Tony and I were at his family’s reunion down at Lake Poke.  I must’ve been a little drunk.  I told you all about his family history.  Anyway, he talked me into this canoe, it flipped over when he went to stand up, and I found out that I could swim.  All the way back to shore.  We split up about a month later. You think it had something to do with my realizing I could swim and all?”</p>
<p>I shrugged.  I wanted to say something about how her last boss was named Tony, too, and that maybe she subconsciously looked for trouble.  Alicia complained for a year that he put too much pressure on her.  She worked for an audiologist, pretending to be a nurse of sorts, as far as I could tell. Mostly she worked the front desk and tried to figure out Medicare.  Sometimes she sat patients down and made them respond when they heard a beep from this audiology machine.</p>
<p>“You were, like, twenty-eight?  You didn’t learn how to swim until you were twenty-eight?  Wow.  I never thought about it. Have we never been swimming?”</p>
<p>Part of the “pressure” she perceived from this doctor might’ve concerned his wanting her to always speak just above a whisper to everyone who walked into Hub City Audiology.  And then she felt obligated to talk everyone into buying the most expensive hearing aids.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know.  After I had to swim out of Lake Poke and leave Tony, swimming became my favorite exercise for a couple years.”  Alicia re-crossed her legs over mine.  She raised her glass, then pointed it across the cove.  Just as she did, a dozen boys spilled out onto the porch, all wearing orange shirts.  By “boys” I mean frat brothers, and by “orange” I mean they must’ve gone to Texas, Tennessee, Clemson, or Syracuse.  I doubted that a fraternity would come spend the second week of June a thousand miles from their colleges, and Tennessee has a number of fine lakes.  I tried to think of other colleges with orange jerseys, but couldn’t.  I thought back to a number of gated community houses where I’d been hired out to do something as simple as changing a fuse, but couldn’t remember an orange motif in the family rooms.</p>
<p>I picked up the binoculars and looked across the cove.  After adjusting the cylinder and scanning our new neighbors, I noticed one guy looking back at me with a pair of his own binoculars.  He gave me the finger.  I set the binoculars down and didn’t say anything to Alicia.  She didn’t need more possible strife, what with her pressuring audiologist ex-boss and those horrific flashbacks that involved a capsized canoe.</p>
<p>Luckily Alicia and I didn’t say anything first, once those guys came out.  One of them said, in what I would bet a normal conversational tone, “Hey, let’s make some bets about that pontoon boat.”  He didn’t scream it out.  What with Alicia’s background in audiology, and this elective geography course I took in college that let me understand the tricky echoes that can occur in valleys, I put my index finger up to my mouth and whispered, “We can eavesdrop.  We need to speak quietly.”</p>
<p>She said, “Oh, I got that down,” and smiled.</p>
<p>From across the water one of the college boys said, “Hey, man, someone put on some music.”  Then for five minutes it sounded like background noise, like a group of a dozen people all talking at once.  I barely said to Alicia, “I hope they’re not up all night.”</p>
<p>She said, “I bet I didn’t dogpaddle but ten feet, and then went straight into the standard Australian crawl.  Maybe in the morning we can go out there&#8211;take out the pontoon, anchor it, and swim around.”</p>
<p>I picked up the binoculars and looked to the side of the house across the cove.  Sure enough: Breaker box right there in plain view, eye level. I thought, Do not do anything that would make Alicia look later for a third husband.</p>
<p>*<br />
I poured easy-light charcoal into the normal black smoker on the far end of the porch.  Alicia said she would wait until the coals were burned down before she decided what she wanted on the first day of our vacation.  I’d agreed to take the pontoon out in the morning, but then I wanted to fix Carnell Henderson’s problems, then re-check everything on both Sunday and Monday before we went home where, I assumed, Alicia would begin looking for a new job and I’d catch grief from my regular customers&#8211;I catered to a wealthier clientele who would not admit that they had mice chewing wires to the HVAC unit’s fan circuit board, or they bought elaborate outside ceiling fans for their verandas before understanding that they didn’t run on batteries. Or they forgot how to run their own dryers, blamed me, and then I had to come over and close the door to the Samsung before pushing the Start button.  House call.  Five minutes. Eighty bucks.</p>
<p>“I’m not even hungry now,” Alicia said.  “I feel like I’m not even going to get hungry for some reason.  Hey, did we bring any aspirin?”</p>
<p>The fraternity boys started playing Old School disco loudly, bands that I recognized even though they were before my time: Earth, Wind, and Fire.  The Commodores and Mother’s Finest.   The Ohio Players. I got out the binoculars again to make sure they weren’t in their fifties, or maybe their parents had shown up for the evening.  The bass reverberated across the water and made the foundation of Carnell’s house throb.  I said, “Fuck.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t bring the aspirin?  I put it out on the table before we packed,” Alicia said.<br />
I lit the grill and, in my mind, thought I foresaw what I’d be doing later in the middle of the night.  I said, “I got it.  It’s on the kitchen counter inside.”</p>
<p>“Come here, Ted,” Alicia said.  She tapped the chair beside her.  “Let’s just sit down here and do some drinking.”  She’d gotten up and relieved the freezer from its ice bin, and poured it into a cooler Carnell kept on the deck.  “You’re the smart one here.  Tell me what I should do.”</p>
<p>Even though Tony might’ve demanded too much of my wife, he didn’t harass her in any way.  Alicia and I weren’t the litigation-type of people anyway.  We met two years after both of our divorces&#8211;mine had to do with an ex-wife who cheated on me&#8211;and we married two years later.  In six months we’d celebrate our tenth year together, our eighth married.  At parties people liked to hear how we met: She had moved to an upscale apartment complex, I’d gotten hired to install lights around the pool, and we flirted with one another.</p>
<p>The next day Alicia called her landlord and said that her dining room lights no longer worked, could he please call up the electrician who had been there the day earlier. She had tripped the breaker on purpose.  A day later, Alicia put on rubber gloves and tennis shoes, then shoved a paperclip in one of her outlets, which caused a gigantic scorch mark.  She called the landlord.  Alicia and I went out to a fondue restaurant the next night.</p>
<p>I said, “Baby doll, we don’t really need the money.  You do what you want to do.” This wasn’t all that true, but it seemed like the right thing to say after two tumblers of bourbon and Coke.  I said, “You want to go back to school and take some classes?  Do that.  You want to come out with me and help out every day?  That’s fine.”</p>
<p>Alicia already had a college degree, too.  She had majored in early childhood education, spent three years teaching second grade at a public education elementary school, said Screw this, and decided to never have children.  She told me that at one point with Tony the first husband she took the pill, had an IUD, used a diaphragm, and shoved a sponge up there.  By the time I came around she was down to the pill and a diaphragm.</p>
<p>“I need a job, Ted,” she said.  “Those three years I have in the state retirement system?  It’s not even getting interest, what with the account being inactive.  If you died, I don’t know what I’d do.”</p>
<p>I didn’t say, If we had a couple kids maybe they could take over All Out Electric.  I said, “I got a life insurance policy.  We’ve got money saved up.  The house will be paid for in fifteen years.  I ain’t going to die.”</p>
<p>The boys across the way dumped out a bucket of golf balls onto the ground.  When their CD was between tracks I made out one of them saying, “Whoever hits the pontoon, everyone else has to do a shot.  Hit the canoe?  Two shots.”  I got out the binoculars and looked over there.  It appeared as if they dumped out nothing but brand new Titleist Pro V1s.  Those things cost four bucks apiece.</p>
<p>“These are really good binoculars,” I said to Alicia.  “They’re going to play a drinking game that involves our pontoon and canoe.  Or Carnell Henderson’s.”</p>
<p>She said, “I can tell you what got me depressed,” as if we had been talking about it for a solid month.  I’ll admit that at times I get consumed with work, but I felt sure that Alicia had not admitted any form of depression until this point.</p>
<p>I said, “What?” but held the binoculars back up and watched the first guy swing a nice Ping pitching wedge.  He fell short by a good forty yards.  I pulled the binoculars down, then swung the strap around my neck and let it rest on my lap.  I said, “Depression about the job?”</p>
<p>Alicia poured out the rest of the first bottle.  She said, “This is a weird story.  You have that degree in psychology.  Tell me if this makes sense.  It’s the only thing I can think of, as far as a cause.”</p>
<p>“I don’t have any advanced degrees, honey, you know that.  It wouldn’t be right for me to offer up any kind of diagnosis.  Or prognosis.  Which is the right word?  I never remember.”</p>
<p>Another guy swung hard, topped the ball, and it dribbled into ankle-deep water.  My wife said, “This woman came into the office about a month ago.  Tiny woman, maybe four-eleven.  You could tell she used to be taller, and regal.  She had a pretty bad hunched back, you know.  I know for a fact that she was eighty-eight years old, because I typed in her information.”</p>
<p>I said, “I’m listening.”  I kept eye contact with Alicia, but got up, dipped my cup in the ice chest, and got more bourbon.  I hadn’t come close to finishing even half of half a fifth, but bourbon’s a little more potent than merlot.  Across the cove, the CD skipped, and then someone turned it off.  I heard one of those boys say, “Let’s make it a little more interesting.”</p>
<p>Alicia stared over that way, but she had a look on her face similar to a farm animal lost in thought.  “Her name was Ms. Young.  Deaf as a railroad spike.  I mean, she could hear if you yelled at her, but that was it.”</p>
<p>I wanted to ask if the woman drove herself to Hub City Audiology, but didn’t.  Sometimes Alicia complained that Tony Husband #1 interrupted.  And so did Tony Boss the Last.  Also, I wanted to say how funny it is for people with the last name Young to get so old.</p>
<p>“She came in right at the end of the day.  Dr. McKinney had gone off somewhere and hadn’t returned.  I kind of think he forgot. I had to call him up and remind him, and he started cussing, you know.”</p>
<p>I wanted to say, At one of those schools for the deaf, I guess teachers could get away with cussing all they wanted.  I said, “He probably went out to play golf.”</p>
<p>“So Ms. Young took a seat in the waiting room and I yelled out at her that the doctor was with a patient, that he was running behind, and all those other lies I had to tell when things weren’t going smoothly.  When things weren’t going professionally.”</p>
<p>I said, “I only met him at those Christmas parties, but I thought right away that he had a drinking problem.  I mean, I can’t talk,” I said, raising my glass.  “But I’m not in charge of bringing sound into people’s lives. Just light.  I guess I’m an eye doctor’s worst enemy.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Alicia said.  “I never smelled booze on his breath.  At least not at work.”</p>
<p>My cell phone vibrated a little in my pocket.  I’d gotten a text message.  I said, “Hold on one second,” to Alicia and pulled it out.  Carnell Henderson had sent me a message that read, “I forgot.  Flag Day coming up.  Please put flag out on pole. In upstairs closet, on shelf.”</p>
<p>I texted back, “Okay.”  To Alicia I said, “Hell, I didn’t even know why we had a long weekend.”</p>
<p>She said, “And there aren’t great drugs in the audiology field, unless someone stabs your eardrum with an ice pick, which happens more than you’d think possible.”</p>
<p>*<br />
There were no members of the golf team in this particular fraternity.  One of them got so frustrated he pulled out an oversized driver and hit a duck hook that bounced below our deck.  I got out the binoculars to see if the guy who gave me the finger earlier might be looking, but all those boys simply turned around and feigned staring at their lake house, as if nothing happened, as if I witnessed a golf ball dropping from the sky.</p>
<p>I said, “We should’ve brought some marshmallows.  Hotdogs and marshmallows.”</p>
<p>Alicia got up, walked into the kitchen, and came back with four pork chops, but she didn’t put them on the grill, just set them down on a table nearby.  She said, “I said, ‘Tell me about yourself,’ because I couldn’t pretend that she wasn’t sitting on the other side of the window, not eight feet away.  I yelled out, ‘Tell me about yourself, Ms. Young!’ and thought I would get back something how she taught school for forty years. Maybe how she taught chorus or band.”</p>
<p>My phone vibrated again.  I looked down to see that Carnell Henderson texted me, “There’s a yellow Don’t Tread on Me flag, too.  Put that below the other flag.”</p>
<p>I looked at my wife and wanted to tell her about how we needed to trash this place, but she said, “They had one of those wildlife cameras.  You know, Ms. Young and her husband had one of those motion sensor cameras down toward the end of their driveway, pointed to the house.  In case anyone broke in, they could go look at the video or whatever and give it to the police.”</p>
<p>It might’ve been ninety-five degrees.  I got up and checked the top of the ice chest to make sure it felt secured.  I looked across the cove and watched the fraternity boys give up on their Hit the Pontoon game.  Presently George Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic would blast out of the house, that song about how people should get off their asses and jam.  I said, “I’ve been meaning to get one of those cameras for us.  I want to train it on the back of my truck, because in time someone’s going to try to steal my tools and sell them at the flea market.”</p>
<p>Alicia shook her head.  “This is bad,” she said.  “This will kill you.  Wait&#8211;that’s a bad way to put it, what with what I’m about to say.  This will explain my depression.”</p>
<p>Again, I didn’t say, “I didn’t know you’d been depressed,” for if indeed she’d mentioned it a number of times, this would only make it worse, I figured. I looked over at the pork chops and counted eight flies. I said, “Are you hungry?”</p>
<p>“Ms. Young’s husband got murdered two years ago.  She happened to be visiting her sister in the hospital up in Asheville.  She told me that she understood how she should feel lucky about it, but in most ways she felt guilty.”</p>
<p>I said, “Was he shot?”  I said, “Was it at night, and he was shot in bed?”</p>
<p>My wife held up her left palm. “I stood up from my station at Hub City Audiology so I could hear Ms. Young better.  She said the cops got the camera and checked things out.  Listen, to this.  Ted.  It went like this. Ted, are you listening to me?”</p>
<p>I said, “I’m looking right at you, honey.”</p>
<p>She said, “A deer showed up.  Then a possum.  Then one of the neighborhood dogs.  Then a raccoon.  Then that dog again.  I might be getting some of this out of order.  I know that she said to me ‘neighbor’s dog’ quite a few times.  A coyote showed up once or twice, then a man they didn’t know.  A cat showed up a couple times.  A fox.  The Youngs lived out in the country, way out there. The Duke Power meter reader.  Then that first man came again, and hung out for quite a while in the middle of the night.  He came back the very next night.  Then the camera showed Ms. Young coming back home. And then the sheriff’s deputy, and a coroner a little while later.  Like that. And then a hearse taking Mr. Young off the property.”</p>
<p>I thought, Goddamn.  I thought, None of us are safe.  “It was that guy?”</p>
<p>“That man ended up killing Ms. Young’s husband, then stealing a wallet, all the silver, a bunch of shit.  They haven’t caught him yet.”</p>
<p>I said, “Did the woman come home to find her husband dead in bed?”</p>
<p>“This is the saddest part.  She told me that when one of them was out of the house they had a Dr. Pepper rule.  They called each other at 10, 2, and 4, no matter what.  When Mr. Young didn’t answer the phone at ten in the morning, and then again at two in the afternoon, she drove back down from Asheville.  And that’s what she came home to.”  My wife got up and walked toward the grill.  She said, “We waited too long.”</p>
<p>The fraternity brothers came back outside armed with golf clubs.  They stood in a line and counted down before all of them swung at the same time.  One of them actually hit the pontoon, and the ball dinged off into the water.  I got out the binoculars and watched as they all did shots from a bottle of Rebel Yell.  I said, “We waited too long for what, Alicia?  Alicia.  What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“You need to put more charcoal on.  Or I could just go inside and put these things in the oven.  I could bake these pork chops.”</p>
<p>I sat there staring across the cove at young men dancing around, whooping, raising bottles and/or irons.  I envisioned this Ms. Young woman sitting there in Hub City Audiology, telling her story to a complete stranger receptionist.  I said, “Goddamn.  Why didn’t you tell me this story right after it happened?  No wonder you quit.  Did these kinds of stories happen a bunch?”</p>
<p>I caught myself looking at the soffit and facia of Carnell Henderson’s lakehouse to see if he’d rightly installed motion sensor cameras.  I looked off into the surrounding trees. “Not a bunch.  But there are stories like that everywhere, every day.”</p>
<p>I got up and poured more coals on top of what hadn’t quite burned out.  From across the water I heard another golf ball hit the pontoon, then another onslaught of battle cries.  I said, “I better go find those flags.  Now you got me paranoid that we’re being watched by a wildlife camera.”</p>
<p>At seven o’clock the drinking game stopped and the music came on full-blast.  It went from those Seventies disco tunes to Lynyrd Skynyrd, with the boys yelling out “Go Fuck, Alabama” during the chorus of that one song, which made me think that perhaps these scholars did hail from Tennessee.  I don’t want to say that Alicia and I had turned into the kind of people who eat supper at five and fall asleep by dark, but maybe we were.  At least after drinking way too much bourbon and wine, we were.  When we got back home and returned to normal routines, I felt sure that we’d eat during the national news, go to bed during the local news, maybe watch re-runs in between.</p>
<p>So Alicia put meat on the grill and I walked upstairs to gather the flags.  I know that I shouldn’t make assumptions about wealthy lakehouse-owning people, but I walked into the upper-level bedroom to find the two single beds, a lamp, and an old-fashioned Morris chair, plus one bookcase, loaded with hardbacks.  Listen&#8211;not that I’m a big reader or anything&#8211;but I immediately thought, Good on old Carnell Henderson.  I kind of envisioned his coming up here between rentals and plopping down to do something besides watching movies and trolling the internet non-stop.  I opened the closet to discover no hint of a normal American flag, folded into a triangle.  No, there was that stupid Gadsden flag with Don’t Tread on Me and the rattlesnake thing, plus a stars-and-bars flag of the Confederacy.  Beneath the shelf, dangling off of padded hangers, were what appeared to be six genuine confederate uniforms.  I couldn’t tell if they were moth-eaten or bullet-riddled.</p>
<p>I said, “Goddamn.  He’s one of those Civil War reenactors.”</p>
<p>I turned and looked up at the crown molding to see if there was a camera, or if there was one of those innocuous teddy bears stuffed with a camera, maybe perched against a pillow.  I kept the closet door open, walked over to the bookcase, and scanned the titles: <em>The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government</em>, by Jefferson Davis; <em>The Private Letters of Jefferson Davis; Stonewall Jackson’s Book of Maxims; The Quotable Robert E. Lee; Jewish Supremicism</em> by David Duke; <em>Mein Kampf</em> in both German and English.  Then there was a whole shelf of books written by Fox newscasters and frequent guests: Bill O’Reilly, Ann Coulter, the dude with hair growing on his forehead. The shelf below it contained books with titles like <em>How Come I’m Paying Taxes So Lazy People Can Live Off My Success?</em> and <em>Send Him Back to Kenya</em>! and <em>How Come They Can Say the N-Word But I Can’t?</em></p>
<p>I bent down closer to find those last three books self-published by CreateSpace, BookSurge, and iUniverse, and all written by one Carnell Henderson.</p>
<p>*<br />
I said, “I can’t help this guy out,” to Alicia.  She stood at the end of the porch, staring over at the frat boys.  I wondered if she flashed her boobs at these kids while I pored over a library and closet of a probable racist.  I said, “Something’s burning,” and looked over at the pork chops, which at this point could’ve been used for a tailless beaver’s prosthetic device.</p>
<p>Alicia said, “Goddamn.  I forgot.  Where’ve you been?”</p>
<p>If I’d’ve gone into further studies in psychology, I would’ve probably honed in on paranoia, its causes and effects, its importance in regard to evolution.  I told my wife all about what I found upstairs, but ended it with, “You know, it might just be a test.  Maybe Carnell Henderson’s a raging liberal, and he set this whole thing up just to see how I’d react.  Like if he called me over to work on his heat pump in the Fall, he might really want to see if I said something like, ‘Hey, brother, you ought to join my chapter of the KKK,’ or ‘You want to go out on a lynching with me some night?’ This could all be a trap.  Or one of those reality TV shows and we’re being filmed by that group of Hollywood executives across the cove, all of them dressed up like frat boys as a disguise.”</p>
<p>Alicia went and picked up my bourbon bottle and said, “You’re cut off.”</p>
<p>I said, “I’m serious.  Hey, you want me to go get out that chicken?”</p>
<p>My wife walked up and hugged me.  She set the bottle down on a table.  “I never finished my story about Ms. Young,” she said.  “I didn’t get to the important part.”</p>
<p>The guys across the cove put on that Charlie Daniels’ song about being proud to be a rebel and how the South was going to do it again.  They whooped and played air fiddles, which you don’t see that often in polite, sane company.  I thought, Where are we?  I thought, Did I take a wrong turn and end up at the far western arm of this lake, maybe in Alabama or Mississippi?</p>
<p>I yelled out, “Hey, shut up” across the way, knowing that they’d not be able to hear me.<br />
Alicia said, “Ms. Young wanted to know if Dr. McKinney could do something about making her more deaf.  She said she constantly heard her husband screaming.  Inside her head.  She wanted to know if there was a procedure that could stop sounds from ever entering.  Do you see what I mean?”</p>
<p>I looked at my wife and sobered.  I thought, Is Alicia trying to tell me something?  Is she saying that she wants my voice out of her head?  I thought, Is this her way of asking for a divorce?</p>
<p>I was about to say, “Hey, let’s go skinny-dipping and we can sober up a little,” when out of nowhere one of the orange-clad boys came around the corner of the deck.  That meant he would’ve come through the house downstairs, and so on.  I felt sure, later, that I had locked the door, just out of habit.  I’ll give myself this: I didn’t scream like a kid on his first roller coaster.  I saw the boy peripherally, turned my head, and said to Alicia, “Anyway, yeah, I brought along the pistol,” as if I really had one.</p>
<p>The kid spun toward the other house and yelled out, “Turn that down!” but there was no way anyone could’ve heard him.</p>
<p>Alicia said, “Who are you?”</p>
<p>This boy looked to be about twelve to me.  “My daddy called and said you need to make sure and turn the light on below the flag pole.  He said that after you put up those flags, turn on the light so anyone driving by can see them.” He pointed back to his house and said, “We done got our flags up.” Sure enough, a stars-and-bars, plus a Gadsden flag.</p>
<p>I said, “You’re Carnell Henderson’s son?”</p>
<p>He nodded.  “I’m Carnell, too. We own this house and the one across the way.” He pointed with his thumb but didn’t turn around.  He wore one of those baseball caps with the flat brim.  “Me and my brothers got that house for the whole week.  Daddy lets us have it twice a year.  Me and my brothers put up our car keys, you know, so we don’t drive nowhere. Me and Pierpont over there have to run the weedeater at some point before we leave, to pay for it all.”</p>
<p>Alicia&#8211;and I’ll give her this&#8211;said, “Me won’t drive drunk, either.  Me one time hit a pebble with the weedeater and shattered a window.”</p>
<p>He didn’t seem fazed.  I started laughing.  I said, “Y’all have bad taste in music.  And it’s too loud.”</p>
<p>Carnell, Jr. said, “From what me and the brothers understand, you’re just a regular worker staying here for free. Daddy didn’t say you was some kind of music critic. You want to hear loud?  Wait till you get that stereo working here, and then leave.  Half of us gonna come over here and crank the music at the same time.  We brung us two CDs of everything.”</p>
<p>Then, in case I didn’t quite comprehend what he meant, Carnell Jr. explained how one boy over at the other house and one boy over at this one would go one-two-three over a cell phone, then both hit Play simultaneously.  He said, “We gone blow this lake up, Cuz.  Me and Porter over there just talking about a way to make y’all leave early so we could crank the tunes both sides.”  Again, he pointed over his shoulder without turning.  “I’m talking stereo-stereophonic.”</p>
<p>I said, “Man, go back to your party.  I’ll get the flag up and turn on the lights.”</p>
<p>He nodded sharply once, stared at me too long&#8211;as if to scare me, I assumed&#8211;then said, “We gone eat steaks the like you ain’t ever seen before, cows raised right there on the college.  I know you can’t do it, but don’t ruin your night wishing you was me.” He said, “Ma’am” to Alicia.</p>
<p>Carnell Jr. went back through the house, down the stairs, out the door.  On the other side of the cove came another one of those Lynyrd Skynyrd songs, the one about a someone named the Breeze.</p>
<p>I poured one more drink, knowing that it would be the last for the evening.  Alicia grabbed my arm, put her index finger up to her lips, and cocked her head.  Through all that music she heard Carnell, Jr. say to one of his fraternity brothers, “About three in the morning?  We gone fuck with them people.”</p>
<p>Someone said to Carnell, Jr., “Don’t he know who your daddy is?”</p>
<p>Someone said, “Steaks ready.”</p>
<p>Of course I couldn’t make out any of these conversations, but my wife, with her audiology training and expertise, could.  She told me one sentence at a time, like a regular United Nations interpreter.<br />
*<br />
Unfortunately it doesn’t matter flying a Confederate flag upside down.  An American flag&#8211;you can fly that flag upside down in order to display some kind of distress, I guess like if everyone inside the fort has food poisoning, I don’t know.  I could’ve wiped myself with the flags as some kind of statement, kind of like I did with the last check I wrote out for the student loan corporation after they defaulted me twice for one-day-late checks.</p>
<p>Besides her bat-like sonar, Alicia possessed some mind-reading skills.  We piled the rest of the charcoal on the grill, she led me inside and, whispering, said, “Hoist the flags.  Turn on the light.  You don’t want to appear a troublemaker, so then later on Henderson&#8211;or those boys across the way&#8211;won’t suspect you.”</p>
<p>I said, “We should just leave.”</p>
<p>“Nope.  Go fix the TV and wi-fi now.  I know that you’re a moral person, Tedrick.”  She meant it, for Alicia rarely used my full name, partly because I asked her to never say it in public. “I know you never think up things like I thought up all the time over at Hub City Audiology.  You know how many near-deaf people treated me badly?  Every other one.</p>
<p>You know how many times I thought up some kind of retaliation?  Every day.  And then there’s Dr. McKinney.  Some people play solitaire.  Or sudoku. They keep a crossword puzzle handy.  Me, I started thinking up ways to retaliate early on. I guess I started right about the time Tony stood up in the canoe and forced me to swim.”</p>
<p>I stood there like an idiot, trying to remember every time Alicia wanted to change the channel to one of those shows about mysterious murders, maybe on Dateline, or City Confidential.  I said, “Let’s just go for a swim and clear our heads.  I’ve been thinking about exercising more anyway.”</p>
<p>My wife told me to fix the entertainment center, again, and to raise those flags for Flag Day.  She said, “I’ll meet you downstairs on the landing.”  She looked at her wristwatch, then took it off.  “Midnight.  That seems appropriate.  One minute after midnight.”</p>
<p>I could’ve rigged Carnell Henderson’s house so that an electrical fire occurred as soon as someone turned on the dryer, or TV, or stereo.  For a racist, though, he’d always treated me fairly.  I guess I might not say the same thing if I were non-Caucasian.  He wouldn’t have hired me in the first place had I been black, Hispanic, or Asian.</p>
<p>I got the TV and stereo connected correctly and turned the volume up on both so that when those college boys came over they’d blow the speakers. I set the place up for wi-fi, but couldn’t think of how to blow out a computer.  Outside, I raised those flags.</p>
<p>I tried not to think, You are such a pussy.</p>
<p>I tried to think, If this makes Alicia happy, then it’s all that matters.</p>
<p>I’m not sure where she found the box of roofing nails. She also held my full plastic bottle of lighter fluid.  I met her below the deck where we’d spent the evening.  Across the way the music blared louder than ever, the windows and doors to that lake house open.  And it started to rain, barely, which kept the boys inside.</p>
<p>“Here’s how this’ll work,” she whispered to me.  “We’re both swimming across the cove. You and me. It’ll prove that our marriage is better than my first one.”  Already I foresaw the plan&#8211;scatter roofing nails around the base of the flag pole, douse the rope, light it up.  Frat boys run out barefoot, and so on.  Alicia said, “This will make me happy.  It’ll make me happy in about three ways.” Later on I would talk myself into realizing that she’d lay a trail of fluid from charcoal grill to front porch.</p>
<p>I said, of course, “How’re we going to carry the nails?  How’re we going to keep a lighter or matches dry?”  I thought, We are too old and slightly normal to do these kinds of things&#8211;but figured that her third need for happiness fell into the Let’s Be More Spontaneous category, something I rarely achieved, and my wife seemed to attain only when walking off jobs.</p>
<p>I backstroked, with the box of nails on my belly and my Zippo atop the box.  Alicia swam  a one-armed sidestroke, the container of Kingsford held just above water level.  Although we never mentioned it, we both knew not to talk in the water, or on Carnell Henderson’s other property, or while packing up and leaving.  We understood not to even speak while driving home, late at night, on back roads. We required complete quietness. I wanted to say something&#8211;slowly transversing the cove&#8211;about how the Army celebrated its birthday on June 14, also, and how we kind of acted like Green Berets I’d seen on one of those movies, way back during my first marriage when I never slept well. Back then, I didn’t see myself as an accomplice. Back then, I never considered myself patriotic, either.</p>
<p>Back home, I would install security cameras, and ask my hardware guy about top of the line listening devices.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prone to a mildly paranoid view of the universe and her place in it, Ms. Hicks figures the weather is out to teach her a lesson.  She can’t imagine what she’s supposed to learn, but she thinks it probably has to do with her daily harvest of hope and despair.  Heavy on the despair side.</p>
<p>Ms. Hicks has self-diagnosed herself as everyday bi-polar.  A sunny morning with the city’s crabapple trees dropping blossoms on the sidewalk stupefies her with spiritual yearning.  Sleet slapping her face from a February wind makes her wish somebody would shoot heroin into her veins.</p>
<p>She’s learned weather has its own code of conduct and most likely it won’t kill her or even make her crazy enough to kill herself.  <em>Don’t like the weather?  Just wait a few minutes.  </em>Ms. Hicks thinks the local folk say this as a mantra against their uneasiness with ever-changing weather.</p>
<p>A lesson from the weather could be okay.  Depending on the content.  She doesn’t like the way she is&#8211;how she thinks, feels, or behaves.  Problem is, even if she could change, there are no role models.  Male or female.  Lots of lousy ones.  At least she can say <em>I’m glad I&#8217;m not so-and-so</em>.</p>
<p>A man stands on a street corner asking pretty women who walk by him, “Wanna fuck?”  He gets dirty looks, he gets kicked, slapped, punched, kneed in the balls.  Somebody asks him, “Why do you do this?  You’re taking a hell of a beating.”  The man says, “Yes, but I get a lot of fucks.”</p>
<p>Ms. Hicks thinks that joke is almost the story of her life.  <em>I’m taking a beating because I really want something.  It’s not exactly a fuck, but I think it’s similar. I’m okay with the beating, it’s just that I’d like to get a little of whatever it is that I want.  I wish I could say what it is.</em></p>
<p>Ms. Hicks has her house and her badly tended flower garden out back.  She knows she’s done little to deserve these benefits.  She won’t say <em>blessings</em>&#8211;she’s purged that word from her vocabulary.  If she were homeless she’d kill herself as dramatically as possible.  Set herself on fire.</p>
<p>The roof over her head is her defense against everything.  When big storms rampage through her city at night, Ms. Hicks wakes up and feels her house shaking.  Sometimes she goes out to her garden and squints up at the sky.  <em>Go away</em>, she whispers.  Take your nastiness off of my property.</p>
<p>Fact is, she respects weather.  Especially lightning.  Only an idiot wouldn&#8217;t take lightning seriously.  Thunder makes dogs tremble.  Cats run under the bed.  Ms. Hicks thinks even elephants must get nervous when they see lightning.  Giraffes are probably the most afraid of all.  Poor dears.</p>
<p>Ms. Hicks put in a crop of begonias.  Dug up dirt to make shallow holes, added store-bought manure, gingerly removed the young plants from their plastic cartons, gently placed them roots down, lightly packed dirt around them.  Got her hands dirty.  Did her best to savor the dirt fragrance.</p>
<p><em>No children but I’ve got my garden.  No husband but I’ve got weather.  Weather’s faithful.  It lies to me, but it stays by my side wherever I go.  Flatters me in April.  Takes me to the beach in August.  Then in February it kicks me around the house and tells me I’m an ugly old hag.</em></p>
<p>She entertains herself.  Like eating her croissant topless.  Warms it up while she’s still half asleep, goes to the bathroom, pulls off her nightgown and dines in front of the mirror.  <em>Nice boobs,</em> Ms. Hicks tells her mirror self.  <em>Don’t talk with your mouth full</em>, her mirror self tells her.</p>
<p>When she first went to college and read D.H. Lawrence she took to walking in thunderstorms.  That must have been when she and weather started up their bad romance.  She’d come back into her dormitory soaking wet, shivering, teeth chattering.  Maybe she was daring the lightning to hit her.</p>
<p>Maybe lightning would have struck her if she’d been pretty, but she was plain then and more so now.  She had a few months of prettiness as a sophomore in high school.  Like her physical self was trying to make up its mind which way to go.  She wasn’t pretty long enough to get her hopes up.</p>
<p>Plain is better.  Plain girls develop stronger inner resources.  Ms. Hicks thinks maybe she overdid it.  Her own thoughts seem so much more intriguing and funny than those of anyone she knows.  Whenever she tries to lower her standards and socialize, people give her funny looks.</p>
<p>Being plain doesn’t bother her.  What rankles her is wanting something desperately without being able to figure out what it is.  Not Jesus.  Not even full-time ecstasy.  She spends a lot of time staring out her window.  The birds that come to her garden won’t put up with her pouty ways.</p>
<p>Birds persuade her that Science is a whimsical genius.  And that maybe when the weather does teach her a lesson, it’ll be kind to her.  It’s not kind to the birds, but if they’re unhappy it doesn’t show.  When she sees a junco or a chickadee riding a gusty wind she wishes she could do that.</p>
<p>She’s eating lunch by her bird-watching window when she sees a scruffy man just walk into her back yard.  She can’t see her gate, but he must have unlatched it.  His dark jacket and pants have that shaggy, long-unwashed look of the homeless.  But he’s focused on something back there.</p>
<p>He’s wearing a baseball cap pulled low on his forehead, so she can’t see his face, but she sees that his scraggly hair has long needed cutting.  He’s taking slow steps as if he’s trying to sneak up on something.  Well of course, now she sees it!  A little wing flapping over in the back corner.</p>
<p><em>You can’t just walk into somebody’s garden</em>, she’ll tell him.  She leaves her sandwich on its plate and fetches her warm sweater from the closet.  It’s April and not yet warm.  When she steps out her back door, she feels her heartbeat.  The man must be drunk or crazy, but she’s not afraid.</p>
<p>She’s not so much angry as she is curious about why somebody would trespass so openly.  And why <u>her</u> back yard?  Ms. Hicks’s house looks respectable, but it’s small and ordinary.  It’s a house that makes a statement.  Not much <em>money here</em>, it says.  <em>Who lives here isn’t worth robbing</em>.</p>
<p>“Hey!” she says.  Staccato but not quite a shout.  Startles herself more than she does him.  He’s right there, maybe ten yards away.  Without turning to face her he uses one hand to make a palms-down gesture in her direction.  He’s no taller than she is but shapeless in his lumpy clothes.</p>
<p>She can’t tell if he’s skinny or fat.  The thought occurs to her that this person could be a woman.  She squints and looks carefully and decides it’s a man.  A darned nervy fellow to shush her and not even look at her.  But at least he’s not threatening.  She looks where he’s looking.</p>
<p>It’s a house finch having a sort of seizure.  She’s never seen a bird act like this.  She’s also never seen anybody so interested in a bird they’d trespass on private property to watch one die.  Yes, it’s a pretty thing, reddish head and neck, grey striped breast, but finches are common.</p>
<p>Ms. Hicks sees no need to sentimentalize the death of such a creature.  There are probably three or four house finches hatched for every one that dies.  What’s their life-span anyway?  A couple of years?  This is a part of herself she doesn’t admire.  To herself she admits she has a stunted soul.</p>
<p>To get a better look at the dying finch, she steps toward it.  Which short journey takes her almost alongside the homeless man.  <em>My intruder, </em>she thinks.  <em>My intruder could use a bath.  </em>The bird flops onto its back and twitches.  Ms. Hicks thinks it’s obviously in its final moments.</p>
<p>The man takes three strides, bends, and scoops up the creature.  He stands and gingerly works at clasping its wings to its body.  He seems unaware of Ms. Hicks.  She’s barely aware of herself.  With both hands he holds the finch so that its head pokes out between his forefingers.</p>
<p>The bird blinks, but it also looks calm, maybe even comfortable in the trap of the man’s hands.  It makes no sound.  <em>Maybe the little thing thinks it’s dead and this is how it goes in bird afterlife.  A giant comes along, picks you up and holds you carefully in its warm palms.  </em></p>
<p>This is one of the ten thousand silly thoughts that visit Ms. Hicks all the time.  She knows she’s smarter than most people, but she also knows her mind can be that of an unruly five-year old.  She’s noticing that her intruder’s hands are big but not clean.  Then her eyes meet his eyes.</p>
<p>His face is pie-shaped, oddly pink, and bigger than she expected.  His eyes, nose, and mouth are too small for such a face.  He looks like a character in a children’s book.  His expression is mindlessly sweet and alert but also suspicious.  He squints at her.  He’s damaged, she thinks.</p>
<p>Evidently he’s sized her up and decided he doesn’t need to account for himself or what he’s doing.  He glances around, taking in her weedy little garden, the back of her house with its peeling paint.  Also her windows are filthy.  Who is he to be making judgments about her and how she lives?</p>
<p>He heads for her rag-tag lawn furniture, a metal table and two battered metal-and-wood beach chairs&#8211;pieces on the sidewalk with “Free” signs on them she found on her walks.  No one but her ever sits out here.  Holding the finch with both hands her intruder plops himself down with a grunt.</p>
<p>She’s followed him to her makeshift patio arrangement.  Now that he’s sitting down she expects he’ll speak.  She stands and waits.  He says nothing, doesn’t look at her.  He’s a rag pile.  She’s five feet away, near enough to take in his garbagy smell.  He studies the bird like it’s a book.</p>
<p>“My house,” she says, lifting her arm in what she intends to be the gesture of a person who’s made something of herself.  She considers making another gesture toward his dilapidated shoes and saying, “My land.”  The rag pile doesn’t quite shrug, but she knows he’s thinking about it.</p>
<p>Now Ms. Hicks glances around her garden, her house, her neighborhood.  It’s not much of a place.  Her parents scrimped and saved to pay off the mortgage and leave it to her.  She’s made no improvements.  She can barely pay the taxes.  She knows the neighbors sneer at it and her.</p>
<p>The rag pile begins whistling softly and tunelessly.  He’s looking at the finch, but surely he’s not whistling for the bird’s benefit.  Ms. Hicks sits down in the other chair.  Her intruder has taken the one she usually sits in, and she hopes this one won’t collapse under her.  She watches him.</p>
<p>It’s mid-April, a fickle time of year in Vermont, but this afternoon the sun feels pleasant to her.  The rag pile is not what she’d consider human company, but she finds herself relaxing as if he were an old college friend who’s come to visit.  She’s never known a homeless person.</p>
<p>Because she lives by herself, with her imagination serving as something like a companion, Ms. Hicks isn’t surprised when she falls into a peculiar spell.  She envisions taking on the rag pile as a project.  Cleaning him up, sharing her food with him, coaxing him into communicating with her.</p>
<p>Ms. Hicks is also long accustomed to entertaining ridiculous notions, and as she studies her intruder&#8211;who seems to be wearing at least five layers of clothing&#8211;she recognizes the thought of taking him in as ranking among her all-time worst ideas.  <em>I’d kill him or he’d kill me.</em></p>
<p><em> </em>She sees his eyes flick up toward her face, and she could swear the corners of his mouth twitch into about a five-second grin.  He lifts his hands with the bird in them up and slightly toward Ms. Hicks as if he’s offering it to her.  She sits up straight and prepares to receive it.</p>
<p><em>Does he really mean to give it to her?  Is she really going to accept it?  </em>The rag pile ever so slowly opens his hands.  The bird fluffs its wings slightly but remains sitting in the rag pile’s two palms as if nesting.  It blinks, then stands up on its legs that are like twigs with tiny talons.</p>
<p>Ms. Hicks is enthralled by the sight of the finch swiveling its head like a beautiful toy.  She’s never been this close to one.  There’s a sudden soft <em>pft!</em> as the bird streaks off and away.  In an instant it’s gone.  Ms. Hicks is both exhilarated and bereft.  Her intruder watches her intently.</p>
<p>She’s a little stunned by the intimate presence of the finch followed quickly by its absence&#8211;as if an exquisite painting she’d begun examining had been whisked out of her sight.  Also the strangeness of her intruder and his behavior feel like a dream from which she can’t wake up.</p>
<p>Ms. Hicks remembers a sixth-grade classmate, a loud and obstreperous boy, whose nickname among the children was “Big Face.”  She gives her head a little shake and instructs herself to focus.  She realizes she’s defenseless and not a very competent person.  She’s has zero survival instincts.</p>
<p>The two of them are watching each other now, but she thinks they aren’t really exchanging looks as people do who want to communicate.  This is two animals, each estimating its chances of overcoming the other.  She remembers a saying of her mother’s:  <em>It’s so easy to be nice to people.</em></p>
<p>She never thought her mother had much common sense, but she’s about to ask her intruder if he’d like something to eat when he stands up and shakes himself.  <em>Like a dog or a horse</em>, Ms. Hicks thinks.  Then the man actually smiles at her.  <em>He’s beaming</em>, she thinks.  <em>He’s beaming down on me.</em></p>
<p>He pats her shoulder as he steps past her.  Then he’s out the gate and gone.  <em>He’s very good at exits</em>, she thinks.  The unappealing smell of him lingers around her, but she’s not ready to move.  Her feelings are in an uproar.  At the moment they are mostly a mix of sadness and well-being.</p>
<p><em>And that’s what I’ve been wanting?</em> she asks herself.  It’s the well-being part of it she means.  The sadness is to be expected.  In fact she expects it to expand and bully the other feeling until it goes away.  <em>I’m too easy,</em> she thinks.  <em>All I need is a smile and a pat on the shoulder</em>.</p>
<p>The sun keeps her warm, and she hears bird song, though the birds keep themselves out of sight.  She thinks that’s as it should be.  After all, the look she just had at that finch may last her for the rest of her days.  Finally, though, the air turns chilly.  She shivers and stands up.</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>Mornings now, Ms. Hicks awakes and rises from bed without her daily measure of fury.  It’s not that her days entirely lack occasions for bad temper.  When she reads or hears the news, she’s quickly riled up as usual.  If a car drives too fast down her street, she shakes her fist at it and shouts.</p>
<p>But now her rages dissolve.  Her bad temper has no stamina.  Even the loneliness and sorrow that used to keep her simmering seem to have lost their hold on her.  She thinks her new self lacks backbone.  <em>I’ve been upgraded</em>, she says aloud with a little snort.  <em>Against my will</em>, she says.</p>
<p>She accuses herself of being a fool for missing her old unhappiness.  She’d be embarrassed if anyone knew how she’d savored being so irascible.  <em>Maybe I was just putting on a show</em>, she thinks.  But that’s not true.  She doesn’t like admitting it, but she knows she felt hurt all the time.</p>
<p>Afternoons she goes out to her garden.  She actually does a little work out there.  Mostly just weeding, but one day she gets down on her knees and puts in whole row of pansies alongside the fence.  <em>Big pansy plants a bunch of little pansies</em>, she mutters.  She hasn’t lost her sense of irony.</p>
<p><em>The thing with feathers is screwing up my life </em>becomes her mantra.  She knows the intruder won’t be back, she just wishes she could purge him from her thoughts.  She gets weepy when she brings up the evidence of his taking an interest.  <em>Didn’t he pat my back?! </em>she demands of Science.</p>
<p><em>Next thing you know I’ll be going to Sunday School</em>, she tells Science.  <em>Their big guy couldn’t possibly pay less attention to me than you do,</em> she says.  More and more it pains her to glance out her window and see the empty beach chairs where they sat.  The sight is the rag pile’s insult.</p>
<p>So she’s almost back to her former self when&#8211;wouldn’t you know it?!&#8211;she glances back that way and there he is.  Not just sitting but leaning back in the chair with his hands clasped at his belly, his hat off, his face turned to the sun.  He hasn’t changed his clothes since she last saw him.</p>
<p>Ms. Hicks’s first thought is <em>What an odd-shaped head he has!</em>  Her second thought is to call the police.  She’s still got the salt in her for such meanness.  Her third thought is one that’s familiar and hateful.  <em>What if I’m hallucinating?  What if the cops come and think I’m nuts?</em></p>
<p>She steps closer to the window.  If he evaporates in front of her eyes, she’ll know for sure she’s nuts.  He’s still as a statue.  Or a cadaver.  The mild stink of him comes back to her, though of course she can’t really smell him from where she stands.  She can’t imagine why he came back.</p>
<p><em>He’s no threat</em>, she tells herself.  If he were knocking on her door she might have a reason to be worried.  She goes to the kitchen to fetch an apple, then tiptoes back to the window.  She’s foolishly pleased to see him still sitting there.  She goes back to the kitchen for a knife.</p>
<p>It’s not exactly a plan she’s thought through, but she feels as if she’s acting decisively.  From the kitchen she takes her paring knife, the apple, and a saucer.  She exits the back door, walks at a normal pace out to her makeshift patio, and sits down in the chair opposite her intruder.</p>
<p>She hasn’t looked directly at him yet.  She’s not sure why.   She sets the dish in her lap and cuts the apple in half.  Now she does look at him.  He’s sitting up straight, scrutinizing her.  <em>He’s completely ready to leave</em>, she thinks.  “Would you like half of this apple?” she asks him.</p>
<p>Ms. Hicks has kept her voice neutral and her face pleasant.  The situation interests her anthropologically.  Voice, tone, facial expression&#8211;those signals must have determined the life or death of many a person.  The rag pile doesn’t move, doesn’t stop watching her.  <em>He could just disappear!</em></p>
<p>Ms. Hicks lowers her eyes to the knife, the dish, and the halves of the apple.  “I know people who eat every bit of an apple,” she says quietly.  “Even the core and the seeds.  If you’d like me to leave the peeling on it, let me know.  I’ve gotten used to peeling each slice before I eat it.”</p>
<p>She prides herself on her ability to peel an apple slice quickly, precisely, and with a certain grace.  No living person could care about such a skill.  Even so, she’s aware that her fingers are performing for her intruder.  The peeling drops onto the plate.  She hands him the slice.</p>
<p>Their eyes meet in the split second of the chunk of apple passing from her fingers to his.  She peels a second slice for herself.  She’s surprised to see him waiting for her.  If it’s manners, she appreciates it.  For some moments they observe each other as they chew their bites of apple.</p>
<p>When she peels another slice, he accepts it.  While they finish up the apple, Ms. Hicks decides that the human face is so unappealing in the act of chewing that it’s odd they’ve studied each other’s faces while they eat.  She’s sure that people at dinner parties don’t behave similarly.</p>
<p>She sets the plate with the knife and the apple scraps on the tottery table beside her.  After some silence, during which they both cast their eyes around the yard, Ms. Hicks folds her hands in her lap and says, “I’ve been wondering what was wrong with that finch you brought back to life.”</p>
<p>The rag pile smacks the fingers of one hand against the palm of the other.  The smack is loud enough that it startles Ms. Hicks.  What interests her is that the smacking hand drops through a foot or so of space with its fingers wriggling slightly.  <em>How the bird fell</em>, she thinks.</p>
<p>“A car?” she asks.  He makes no gesture, though he looks straight at her, and his face tells her she’s right.  Exactly how his face conveys it she can’t say.  He didn’t move his eyes or mouth, didn’t blink, didn’t nod.  It’s as close to mental telepathy as she’s ever experienced.</p>
<p>Nothing comes to her to say or do.  Her intruder leans back in his chair and lets his eyelids droop.  Ms. Hicks feels a little drowsy herself.  It amuses her to think they’re about to take a nap together.  Her thoughts meander as they often do when she’s alone.  She wonders if he can talk.</p>
<p>Something makes her suspect that he can talk but that he’s choosing not to.  <em>Maybe he was someone who used to talk for a living.  An actor, a newscaster, a pastor, an academic.  </em>She detects herself making up a romantic past for him.  <em>Maybe he was a protester who got beaten up by the police.</em></p>
<p><em> </em>When she jerks awake, he’s gone.  She hadn’t meant to fall asleep.  She can’t remember ever having done so like this&#8211;outdoors and in the immediate presence of another person.  She finds herself reluctant to move.  As if she’s holding on to the few minutes she and the rag pile spent together.</p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>Ms. Hicks is confident he’ll come back.  The Pattern of Threes applies.  She thinks that pattern is hard-wired into the human brain.  <em>It’s not religion, it’s not fairy tales or myths, it’s Science, </em>she argues against the litigious voice in her that whispers, <em>You’ll never see him again</em>.</p>
<p><em>All right, it’s a willed confidence</em>.  She doesn’t care if it’s informed by her powerful desire to know more about her intruder.  She’s shameless nowadays, though she has her shame all to herself.  Nobody else knows the rag pile was here.  Only she knows about the finch. Or the apple slices.</p>
<p>Ms. Hicks has had years of training in solitude, more than half a lifetime thinking her thoughts and feeling her feelings without anyone else’s input.  <em>All by my lonesome </em>has come to be her mantra.  <em>Actually</em>, she thinks, <em>it always was my mantra, I’ve just now discovered the words for it.  </em></p>
<p>She knows she’s her best self when she’s without human company.  The actions and words of others call up the rage that lies dormant within her.  She’s especially vulnerable to Tea Party Republicans.  She has a vocabulary for them that can be activated by even a short quote in the news.</p>
<p>The rag pile, however, hovers in her mind as more spirit than flesh, more creature than human.  <em>Probably because he never said a single word</em>, she thinks.  The last person to whom she granted this ethereal status was Lucy Beth Grosclose in first grade, she of the transcendent pigtails.</p>
<p>Of course no one will ever ask her about Lucy Beth, but if anyone did, Ms. Hicks thinks she’d weep.  The times she’d played with silent Lucy Beth at recess made her whole body resonate with happiness.  Somehow the gleeful look on Lucy Beth’s face made her aware of the wild bliss she felt.</p>
<p>She realizes there must have been other times when she was happy without realizing it.  She was not a sad child, maybe moody and quirky but rarely sad.  She has no use for that word.  But she doesn’t like the words <em>happy</em> or happiness either, especially when spoken aloud.  Hates to hear them.</p>
<p>In the last few minutes she spent in the rag pile’s company she felt contented and aligned with the world.  She felt a kind of rightness about her life.  <em>If I’d been happy I wouldn’t have fallen asleep, </em>she tells herself.  <em>Happiness is for children, and even then it has no staying power.</em></p>
<p>A word that nags her but that she’d never say aloud is <em>mindful</em>.  It’s a word she associates with extremely self-indulgent people who pay thousands of dollars to talk about themselves to a person who takes notes, sometimes asks questions, but offers neither advice nor opinions.</p>
<p>The ongoing discussion she holds with herself is whether or not she is a mindful person.  She knows she constantly monitors her thoughts and feelings.  She’s so self-aware she sometimes has to remind herself that other people are out there.  That the world and time exist without her.</p>
<p>So does that make her mindful? Does that mean she possesses mindfulness, that quality that only gurus and highly spiritually advanced people are said to have?  Ms. Hicks doubts it.  She sees herself as a self-made spiritual lout. She distrusts all religious thinking.  Even her own.</p>
<p>Her intruder’s first visit was in mid-April, his second in early August.  She’s astonished that she’s continued to believe the rag-pile will return to her garden.  She no longer uses the term <em>back yard </em>for the land behind her house.  She’s tended it enough now to call it a garden.</p>
<p>In November she stops weeding and trimming, though she still takes her walking tours at least twice a day.  If the weather’s decent, she’ll sit a while in her makeshift patio.  She does that even after she needs a sweater.  Then a jacket.  She sits until she starts shivering.</p>
<p>A light snow falls just after Thanksgiving.  The days are shorter.  <em>He’ll come back</em>, she tells herself in the morning when she wakes up.  And she tries to say it just before she falls sleep.  <em>It’s not a prayer</em>!  But she feels like she’s pushing against something she’s not strong enough to move.</p>
<p>4.</p>
<p>Police are investigating the death of a 52-year-old homeless man found inside a tent off the Burlington bike path near Texaco Beach.  At this time there is no evidence of foul play.  There is some indication that the death is related to exposure, according to police. A toxicology test and autopsy will be performed, police say.  An acquaintance of the man notified police, who arrived on the scene shortly after 6 p.m. Tuesday evening and found the man unresponsive in his tent.</p>
<p>5.</p>
<p><em>Unresponsive</em> is how Ms. Hicks begins to think of herself in the days following her reading about the unidentified dead homeless man.  Her custom has been to fetch the paper from her front steps and to read it in her kitchen as she drinks her juice and waits for her coffee to finishing brewing.</p>
<p>She knows it’s him of course.  The knowledge is so absolute and problematic it feels like she’s had major surgery that isn’t healing properly.  For one thing, distasteful as it is to her even to think it, she needs a way to cope with his never coming back.  Knowing so little about him is a help.</p>
<p>She cancels her subscription to the paper, though she has to bring in a week’s worth of papers until the cancellation goes into effect.  She takes them straight to the recycling bin.  Because she knows the dead homeless man will be identified, she doesn’t listen to the radio or watch the news on TV.</p>
<p>Ms. Hicks doesn’t consider what she’s going through as grieving.  <em>I am merely unresponsive</em> she tells herself.  Actually it makes no difference what she calls it, no other human being knows about her visits with the rag pile when he trespassed on her property and sat with her in her garden.</p>
<p>When her parents died she did not grieve.  That’s when she realized that <em>grief</em> was the name other people gave to what she was going through.  A painful period of time from which eventually she would recover.  Out of consideration to her parents’ friends, Ms. Hicks pretended to be troubled and sad.</p>
<p>Both her parents, however, had been old and ill for many days.  They had vaguely wished for an afterlife, but mostly they just wanted their lives to end.  What Ms. Hicks felt about their deaths was exaltation.  They were free of their suffering, and she was free of watching them go through it.</p>
<p>So the pain of grieving as she experienced it was in acting like she felt the opposite of what she actually felt.  That was troublesome, but her performances were limited to the hours she had to spend with the real grievers who brought her casseroles and wanted to reminisce about her parents.</p>
<p>Ms. Hicks suspected most of them were putting on an act for her benefit.  Even so, she’s proud of having done the right thing.  She knows her parents would approve and be grateful to her for it.  They would know that hiding her true feelings was the way she showed the world they’d raised her properly.</p>
<p>Now in these shortened days of January, February, and March, she senses that her flattened-out spirit is an instinctive alignment with the harsh weather and dark season.  There are times when she feels herself about to plummet into despair, but she simply won’t allow it.  She fights it off.</p>
<p>She realizes that <em>I am unresponsive</em>, is what she says now instead of <em>He’ll come back</em>.  She knows her intruder would understand.  She can see his face telling her she’s doing the right thing.  Telling her without a squint, a twitch of his nose, or a tightening of his lips.  Just making her know.</p>
<p>6.</p>
<p><em>I’ve always thought March was the meanest month, Robert.  I hope you don’t mind that name.  I’ve needed something to call you that would restore the dignity my other names for you never acknowledged.  I’ve liked almost every Robert I’ve known, so that’s why I chose it.  So, as I say, March has always seemed to have it in for me, and it’s been no kinder this year.  But this time I’ve found it illuminating.  Maybe it’s been trying to get through to me all these years, and I’ve finally gotten the message.  </em></p>
<p><em> I woke up very early one morning a few weeks ago and couldn’t get back to sleep.  The wind was whistling around the house, the thermometer said it was 16 degrees out, and I knew I had to do something.  It had rained and snowed and sleeted and then snowed again; the sun seemed to have gone into retirement, and I’d been indoors for I don’t know how long.  I felt like I’d read everything in the house, there wasn’t anything I really wanted to eat or drink, I didn’t want to hear what the radio had to say, and I was determined not to turn on the TV.  </em></p>
<p><em> I felt so desperate it actually made me giggle.  4:30 in the morning, two more hours of darkness, and then another whole day to get through.  That was when I thought of you.  I was so ashamed of myself for being whiny that I felt my face heat up the way it does when I’ve done something stupid or wrong or idiotic.  But the thought of you cleared my mind, and I knew what I had to do.  It was like I’d been wandering in some ridiculous fairy-tale forest, and you came along and just nodded your head toward a path.  I was suddenly “filled with purpose,” as they say.  </em></p>
<p><em> I put on long underwear and two pairs of pants, a vest, a parka, a hat, a scarf, gloves, boots, and Yaktrax.  All that clothing was ridiculous, too, but at least I was doing something other than walking from one room to the next and feeling sorry for myself.  I went out into the snow and wind.  It was dark, but of course the streetlights were on.  The sidewalks hadn’t been plowed, but the street was clear, and there were no cars out.  So I walked out into the middle of the street and headed up the hill toward the University.  I thought the Green up there might be a good place to walk.  </em></p>
<p><em> I was wrong about that, the wind got stronger the farther up the hill I went.  I figured March really had me where it wanted me.  It had been saving up this special punishment for me, and I was really going to get it now.  But I figured I was as ready for it as I was ever going to be.  All those clothes were protecting me except for the skin around my eyes between the scarf over my mouth and my hat and parka hood pulled down to my eyebrows.  I had to walk tilted forward, and I had to take baby steps because it was crazy windy, and the street had a coating of ice and packed snow on it. </em></p>
<p><em> The sidewalks into the green were fairly clear, so I took the one that led straight to the fountain at the very center.  A blast of wind struck me so hard that I actually staggered and had to catch myself with a hand on the back of one of those benches where people sit to watch the fountain in pretty weather.  The thought that I might die did occur to me, but I was so insanely alive right then that it seemed like a trivial idea.  I was eight minutes away from my warm house.  Can a person really freeze to death when she’s fifteen minutes away from a cup of hot tea?</em></p>
<p><em> But March got my attention back with a super blast of wind that seemed aimed directly at me.  It was the weather version of a Mack truck, and it made me sit down on the bench and hunker down over my knees.  My body took the cold and wind more seriously than my mind did.  I actually made myself stay where I was, and when the wind let up a bit, I straightened my back and found myself gazing at the waterless fountain.  The campus lights focused on it with that eerie kind of purple whiteness that turned the whole green into a nightmare landscape. </em></p>
<p><em> But here’s the thing.  The wind was blowing a steady stream of sifting snow over the lip of the fountain.  This flowing grey white condensation rose up in an elegant curl.  It formed a perfect arc, which then dissolved into nothing.  I kept trying to see the exact point where the something turned into a nothing.  It was a vision&#8211;or as close to one as I’ve ever witnessed&#8211;and the sight was so compelling that I don’t know how long I sat there staring at it.  I could have died and not even noticed it.  Robert, of course the state of mind I was in made me vulnerable to what I was seeing.  </em></p>
<p><em> I knew that curl of sifting snow was telling me a truth about life on the planet.  Or it was demonstrating a fact that was the opposite of uplifting or beautiful or anything like that.  I confess I had you in mind, Robert.  You were part of the trance that held me there until I started shivering.  When I stood up I knew I’d stopped being </em>unresponsive<em>.  That phase of my life was over.  I had also come to terms with the perverse way I’ve been configured by my genetic make-up and the whole history of my life right up until the wind made me sit down on that bench.  I made sense to myself. </em></p>
<p><em> As you know, I can hardly stand the company of other people, and yet&#8211;as you can plainly see&#8211;I’m someone who needs to talk, someone who needs a particular kind of human contact. I’m not nearly as self-contained as I thought I was.  Which is why&#8211;now that April has brought us some civilized weather &#8211;I’ll be here in the garden pretty often.  You can count on me, Robert.  There’s work to be done out here.  And there are these chairs just waiting for the two of us.  It’s very kind of you to visit with me here.  I appreciate it.  And I’m looking forward to many more conversations with you. </em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ambulance came at midnight in the middle of the week, alarm clock on our nightstand glowing in the dark, flickering lights streaming up through our bedroom windows and circling on the ceiling over our bed. My wife, Mary, propped up on one elbow, parted the Venetian blind slats with her fingers and peered out. There was no siren so I guessed it was the electric company. All winter we’d had power outages along the waterfront. “What now?” I said. There was always something downtown.</p>
<p>After spending a last Christmas in our old house in North Charleston where our kids had grown up—two in college now, one married up north—Mary and I, alone again after thirty years, didn’t need such a big place and we purchased this new townhouse on the water. A good investment our accountant said. For three months we’ve lived with the wind thrashing the shutters battened over triple-paned safety glass. These places were built to resist, to stand up to, another Hurricane Hugo. I don’t know that they would but that’s what the city insisted, the contractor proclaimed, the realtor stressed. “You’ll be safe here,” the realtor said. “This neighborhood will not be leveled again.”</p>
<p>But we didn’t feel safe. Mary was uncomfortable those first few months, wearing sweaters inside the house and hugging herself. “I prefer an oil burner,” she said. These places had electric heat that tinged, took a long time to get hot, and gave us sinus trouble. We regularly woke at night to unfamiliar noises, the water crashing, the wind pounding the building. We’d been in our old house thirty years and had settled and sagged along with its familiar creaks and groans. By April it was warm downtown and we’d pushed back the shutters on the townhouse at night and opened the windows.</p>
<p>Outside, the ambulance engine idled at a loud, high rpm. I rose and went into the bathroom. Mary was sleepy, propped up on her elbow, peering out, squinting and breathing hard.</p>
<p>Over the toilet was a bulls-eye window embedded in the wall. Standing there peeing, I saw the ambulance backed onto the cement driveway of the place next door. EMS responders in reflective jackets ran into the house pushing a wheeled stretcher. The red and white lights atop the vehicle blinked and bounced light all over the neighborhood. There are no yards down here, the land is too valuable. Short driveways and low hedges separate the townhouses along the water. I went back to bed. “Ambulance,” I said.</p>
<p>Mary got up to use the bathroom and didn’t come back. I was tired and needed sleep. The clock showed 12:08. We both had to work in the morning. There was nothing to see. I figured the guy next door had a heart attack. He was about my age, but overweight, a fat guy, and always with a cigarette. Mary said his last name was Henderson. We didn’t know his first name. He was friendly enough whenever I saw him across the hedge. We bragged about our vehicles, our investments, we compared notes on the construction of these townhouses. “Insurance bought ours,” he told me. Before Hugo they had a nice little house down here. A family home, garage, a bit of lawn. In 1989 Hugo forced evacuation. “We came back to nothing,” he said. “Looked like an atomic bomb went off down here.” We were in North Charleston then I told him. He was short and barrel-chested, the right shape for a heart attack, and always puffing the cigarette when we talked over the hedge. His wife smoked too, and they had a son at home. A teenager. Maybe the kid overdosed on drugs. Nah, he’s not the type. It was a heart attack. What else could it be? In any case I wasn’t going over there. I didn’t know them that well. But Mary’s absence made me anxious, I couldn’t fall back to sleep.</p>
<p>Mary worked full time managing an auction house on King Street. They bought out estates and held private sales. High-class stuff. Sealed bids. Mary is in charge of acquisitions. I’ve tried to get her to stop, she doesn’t need the job. And it’s stressful having to assess the substance of things, guessing what will hold value, what will last, and what will diminish. The longevity of things is uncertain she told me, difficult to predict.</p>
<p>I own a building restoration company, which after thirty years steadfastly refuses to run itself. We both work hard, and there is little reason for it. We don’t need the money. We paid the kid’s college bills out of pocket; we drive new cars, dine out, and drink pricy wine. Our old house in North Charleston brought ten times what we paid for it thirty years ago, and while the new townhouse was costly, it comes with little monthly overhead. There is no lawn to cut, no gutters to paint, no shingles to replace. Living downtown is easy and if it wasn’t for our work we’d be free and clear with our time.</p>
<p>I got up and went downstairs. “Mary?” She wasn’t in the house. I looked out the window at Henderson’s place all lit up. People in the street. The house on the other side of ours is full of tall Russian girls. A fact the realtor had tried to conceal. She didn’t want us to know the College of Charleston owned the place to provide housing for scholarship basketball players. The girls use the driveway to pound out intricate basketball patterns. They have one of those portable hoops with a weighted base. Anytime of the day or night they’re likely to be out there running fast and furious routines with a basketball pounding the pavement.</p>
<p>I went through the kitchen and down the stairs to the carport. We live above our cars here in case of flooding. During Hugo this whole area was under seven feet of water. Mary stood in her bathrobe at the end of our driveway, her arms folded across her chest. I walked along the hedge wearing PJ-bottoms, a T-shirt, and a pair of slippers the kids sent for father’s day. The sky was black, what stars were up there were blocked out by the ambulance lights, the engine roared over the breeze and the sound of the water. It was invigorating to be standing outside in our nightclothes with the lights blinding us. I wrapped my arms around Mary from behind and she stuffed her hands into the pockets of her robe and rested her head back against me and I pressed my nose to her hair. “Heart attack?” I whispered.</p>
<p>“Maybe,” she said.</p>
<p>A police car showed up and blocked the street, radio squawking and more lights flashing, blinking our faces red, white, and blue.</p>
<p>The Russian girls next door stood barefoot in their driveway. Six Slavic goddesses in sleeping gear: gym shorts and tank tops, wild bed hair tossed in the wind. An exotic collective of wide flat faces, flared nostrils, dark almond-shaped eyes, stretches of taut skin, arms that reached clear around to their backbones, and remarkable Russian basketball feet.</p>
<p>The paramedics emerged from the Henderson house rolling the stretcher. We saw our neighbor sitting up with his shirt off and his chest crisscrossed with white tape. He had one of those clear plastic masks on his surprised face.</p>
<p>“God,” Mary said.</p>
<p>“Oxygen,” I said.</p>
<p>We watched him load into the ambulance. Mary flinched at the vacuum slam of the heavy door, and the ambulance pulled out, a world of light moving down the dark street toward the hospital not more than a mile away. The cop followed, and we waited long enough to see the distraught wife back out of their driveway in her car. “Poor woman,” Mary said. When her taillights blinked away, we turned and went inside. What else could we do?<br />
In the morning we awoke to the thwack and wallop of basketballs hitting cement, the Russian girls pounding out their routine. “The clock’s off,” I said to Mary.</p>
<p>“The power must have blinked,” she said.</p>
<p>I shuffled down to the carport in my robe to get the newspaper.  I didn’t feel well rested. The girls bucked and pivoted one against another, bumping and pushing. Their bare feet from the night before were now firmly encased in flashy basketball footwear, fair hair pinned and pony-tailed, the sun breaking over the water turned their glistening skin golden. A shout out to me and a basketball came over the hedge and bounced into my carport. My chance to rebound. I retrieved it—hard as a rock the ball—and tossed it back to them.</p>
<p>The slap and rap of their game rang upward through my tall narrow house, four stories if you count the attic and the carport. There is storage room down there, a barbeque grill still in the box, a garden hose to spray off the cement, and the recycling bins. Everything brand new. From our old house we sacrificed the worn, overstuffed, furniture. It didn’t suit this place. The kids took what they wanted and the rest went to Goodwill. We lived lean down here. New airy stuff—everything white, glass, chrome. The hard tile kitchen floor pulsed with the basketball pounding while I made coffee and spread the newspaper out on the table. Maybe there would be something about our neighbor: <em>Man next door has heart attack</em>. “They don’t put stuff like that in the newspaper,” Mary said, when she came down dressed for work.</p>
<p>Weekday mornings she rose at six-thirty, went into her bathroom, and emerged at seven preened and primed for the day. Pressed slacks, silk blouse, a blazer, sensible shoes, glasses on a gold chain around her neck, precisely the right touch of make up and hair spray. Hair speckled with gray cut short now. “Low maintenance,” she says, “no time to mess with it.” Mary is still smart looking at fifty-two, turning heads on King Street, still turning mine after thirty years. This morning though, she is puffy-faced and cranky. “I didn’t sleep well.”</p>
<p>“Damn ambulance.” We heard the wife come home about five a.m. and drive out again an hour later. “Maybe you should cook a casserole or something,” I said.</p>
<p>“What!”</p>
<p>“The kid might eat it.”</p>
<p>“Ridiculous.”</p>
<p>“That’s what people do I think.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to work.” She looped her purse strap over her forearm and went down to the carport carrying her covered coffee mug that fit snugly into console between the seats of her sedan. I followed and kissed her goodbye and watched her drive off. We were both tired. The Russian girls still bounded up and down, bouncing through their rigmaroles, elbows and knees in perpetual motion. The beating basketball moved the coffee in my cup. Made my teeth hurt. Every morning after hammering the cement until my house vibrated, the house that would supposedly stand up to Hugo II, the girls took off running down the street. They ran down Lockwood, up Wentworth, to the College of Charleston, presumably to their day of classes and basketball practice. A torrent of indomitable Russian girls running into next week, striding into the future on legs I’d climb to the summit, if I had the heart for it. <em>Man Has Heart Attack While Climbing Giant Russian Girl</em>, or whatever.<br />
The Henderson house looked vacant, the wife’s car gone, the newspaper in their driveway.</p>
<p>I went around the hedge to retrieve the paper and threw it onto the passenger seat of my SUV. No point having the paper lay there advertising the fact that things had gone amiss. I went inside, showered and stood wet at my desk and called my office. Most of my chores involved meeting clients, considering new jobs, checking city codes, and figuring estimates. We were restoration specialists, working on the old homes downtown on which the city imposed a maze of ordinances. The area is valued for its history, hurricanes aside, the past is not to be altered here, you can’t just build an addition or paint your house without permission. I had to keep up on the rules and regulations and know how to deal with them while maintaining happy clients. That morning I went to a new job on Beaufain, a house so large the owner had spent five years painting it and the place was still a mess. Patchwork and peeling. The bushes and windows all dappled with paint. Ladders, dropcloths, empty paint cans and spent brushes everywhere. The man had inherited the house and was trying to econo-paint it by hiring old hippies in vans and lowland hicks in pickups. I told him my crew could wrap it up inside of a month for fourteen thousand dollars. The figure put him on the verge of tears. “This house is pre-Civil War,” he said, “it withstood Hugo.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know, but restoration means breathing life into the past. That doesn’t come cheap.”</p>
<p>The man looked stricken. I often feel sorry for my clients, trapped as they are in mazes of their own making, but there is nothing I can do, they are battling the forces of time, ultimately a loser’s game. This was a magnificent old house but it had cracked bricks, white and powdery, rotted window casements, and thin single-pane glass. None of which could be ignored. I left the owner to decide and drove around to inspect jobs-in-progress. A tile roof south of Broad, window replacement on Stuart, attic insulation on the Battery. By midmorning I was exhausted and stopped at Starbucks. I saw the College of Charleston basketball schedule, a stack of little cards with a calendar on the back, and slipped one into my shirt pocket. Maybe I’ll purchase two tickets some game night, sit with Mary, a sweater slung over her back, eating junk food and drinking Coke.</p>
<p>Weekends at our old house in North Charleston Mary gardened and I puttered around with the lawn and bushes. Now Mary sleeps in on Saturday while I get up early, before the Russian girls even, and walk down Barre Street in the dark to the bakery and carry back a paper bag rolled at the top with bagels still warm when the sun comes up.</p>
<p>Weekdays we have lunch together unless one of us is dining with a client. We eat at <em>Del Vecchio Casa</em>, our favorite Italian place, or if in the mood we have lighter fare someplace. We drink wine or iced tea, depending on what we have to do in the afternoon. If we have wine we sometimes go home for a nap. Making love in places other than our bedroom has been thwarted by Mary’s bad back. “I can’t be twisted into strange positions,” she says. But maybe we’ve just grown too haughty to bear the embarrassment and coarseness of older people having sex in young places. After thirty years Mary knows everything I know, everything I’ve done, she’s heard all my funny stories, my morning farting, belching after lunch. The dollops of charm allotted to me are long dispensed and worn for her, I imagine, like antique coins. But we are inseparable, incapable of imagining life without each other.</p>
<p>That day at lunch we had iced tea. “What are your afternoon plans?” Mary asked me.</p>
<p>I was thinking of going to basketball practice at the College of Charleston but I didn’t say that. “I have an appointment to look at a sailboat,” I said.</p>
<p>“Not that again,” she said.</p>
<p>“Just looking,” I said.</p>
<p>Our townhouse faced the marina. If we had a boat we could look out over it from the tiny deck that stuck out from our living room. All the townhouses have the same little screened appendage. “<em>Veranda,</em>” the realtor called it. First thing to go when a hurricane hits, I thought.</p>
<p>“I’m thinking of the future,” I said.</p>
<p>“I can’t see us on a sailboat,” she said. “My back wouldn’t take it.”</p>
<p>Mary had dark circles under her eyes. “You feeling okay?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I can’t even swim,” she said.</p>
<p>“You should learn, be good for your back, maybe take lessons at the college.”</p>
<p>After lunch we walked down King Street to the florist where we know the owner. Mary bought flowers each weekday and had me carry them back to the house. In the window of a travel agency was a replica of a white cruise ship, one of those Carnival tour monstrosities. Mary pointed. “That’s about our speed,” she said, “boatwise.”</p>
<p>“Boat wise,” I repeated. “That’s us.”</p>
<p>In front of the auction house we kissed goodbye and I drove down Calhoun toward the marina. Maybe a cabin cruiser, I thought. Too much wind on sailboat. The neighbor’s newspaper was still on the seat and I had to pass hospital to get to the marina so I pulled in. I figured it was the neighborly thing to do.</p>
<p>“A mister Henderson,” I said to the desk nurse. “Heart attack.”</p>
<p>“Joseph P. Henderson,” she said, directing me to the room.</p>
<p>His skin was pasty white and he had an IV in his arm. A game show played on TV. There was a chair for visitors but I didn’t sit. “Hi Joe,” I said. “How you doing?”</p>
<p>“Oh,” he said. “No one seems to know.”</p>
<p>“Well, doctors.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>I carried his rolled newspaper but there was one on the chair along with some magazines so I kept it under my arm. It wasn’t like talking to him over the hedge. He seemed embarrassed about lying in bed since there didn’t seem to be anything wrong with him. Turned out <em>not</em> to have been a heart attack.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what happened,” he said. “I was just sitting there, reading a <em>Time</em> magazine, my wife and kid already in bed, when suddenly I couldn’t breathe.”</p>
<p>“No,” I said.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” he said.</p>
<p>“No cigarette or anything?”</p>
<p>“No, no nothing, I just couldn’t breathe. I got up and went outside. Figured some fresh air—you know. But it didn’t help,” he said. “I panicked. Went inside for my keys.</p>
<p>Thought I might drive to the hospital.”</p>
<p>“You should have banged on our door,” I said.</p>
<p>Mary and I slept while he stood in his driveway below our bedroom trying to absorb oxygen at any cost, through his skin, his brain, ingest it into his blood through sheer force of will, choking to death and begging God for air, more time, anything.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know what I was doing,” he said. “I thought I was in the eye of a hurricane,” he said.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard that,” I said. “Air sucked from the eye, people at the center suffocate.”</p>
<p>“Worse feeling in the world,” he said. “I just waited to black out.”</p>
<p>“Then what happened?”</p>
<p>“I ended up in my car, started it, and switched on the air full blast.”</p>
<p>He had a big white Cadillac. I pictured him with his forehead pressed to the padded dash, his mouth wide open over the AC vent, trying to suck air.</p>
<p>“But it was no good,” he said. I feared they’d find me dead in the morning and think I committed suicide, so I went inside to wake my wife.”</p>
<p>After the paramedics came and had him sitting up in the ambulance with the tape crossing his chest and the mask on his face he took clear breaths of oxygen and felt better. Halfway to the hospital he insisted he was fine and tried to talk them into turning around. “I’m okay now,” he said, “take me back home.”</p>
<p>The ambulance crew chuckled, “Not likely,” one of them said. “We get paid to take you to the hospital.”</p>
<p>“I’ll write you a check,” Joe said. “Really, I’m fine now.”</p>
<p>The doctors at the hospital didn’t think he was fine. “No more cigarettes,” they said, and kept him there running tests, running up his insurance rates, writing on charts and scribbling prescriptions. The nurses brought pills and syrups and shots and bad food.  When it was obvious they had no idea what was wrong with him, they let him go home.</p>
<p>A few months later, in the late days of August, when whatever breathable air there is in Charleston has been sucked down into the muck of the lowlands, it was the same routine at Joe’s house. The ambulance came late at night, our clock still glowed. Mary propped up on one elbow again, a few months older. “Not again,” she said, peering out through the blind slats.</p>
<p>The lights circling above us on the ceiling. “Like writing on the wall,” I said.</p>
<p>Mary got up and put on her robe again. I went to take a leak again and watched from the bathroom window. Once more we stood at the end of our driveway in our nightclothes, the warm wind blowing hard from the water, the Russian girls barefoot again, faces lit by cellphones held to their chests. They’d been gone all summer, the mornings silent and lonely after Mary left for work. I’d stand naked and wet from the shower longing for the basketball pounding that gave a heartbeat to the neighborhood. I’d watch from the kitchen window, trying to catch Joe at the hedge retrieving his paper, grunting as he bent over and straightened up.</p>
<p>This time he was laid out flat. Strapped to the stretcher with white tape across his chest again and the oxygen mask on his face. His head slumped to one side. His cheek pressed to the white sheet. His lips blue and blubbery loose. His eyes bulging. “Trying to breathe again,” I said.</p>
<p>Later we heard that he’d stopped.</p>
<p>This time Mary made the casserole. We sent flowers. Relatives came from out of town, filled his driveway with cars.</p>
<p>No one knew why Joe died, that was the scary thing. He just stopped breathing. His heart was fine. So we couldn’t say “heart attack” as a logical reason and then go through our days watching what we ate, having cantaloupe for lunch instead of calzone, cutting down on the bagels.</p>
<p>“Seems like there should be some cause of death,” Mary said.</p>
<p>The newspaper said Joe was only 53. We vowed to take brisk walks around the neighborhood, planned to spend more time with the kids, maybe get that boat in the marina. I’d been thinking about a speedboat.</p>
<p>August droned into September. We got up early and went to work. A <em>For Sale</em> sign appeared on the Henderson house. Joe’s kid went off to college. The poor woman was left alone and soon hurricane season came down upon us. Ever since Hugo people were jumpy in the fall. We plotted the depressions coming across the Atlantic from Africa. What else could we do? In the evenings sitting outside on the <em>veranda</em>, the building warm from the sun beating on it all day, we watched the water and the boats coming and going, the breeze keeping the mosquitos away. The Russian girls would turn on their driveway light attracting moths and pound the basketball, the sound ringing up through our dark house, driving the blood inside my head.</p>
<p>And when they stopped and went to bed—all together I imagined, like a communal force—the blood settled down to my hands and feet, and there was only the wind and water, the storms coming, inevitable and potent, taking full aim at us—at how it was for us now. What we’ve come to, and what we have left after good times and bad, sickness and health. Mary and I hold hands and suck air gingerly, taking tiny breaths together, trying to make them last, trying not to use up our quota.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It had been six months since her mother had run away from home in the middle of the night, leaving Denise, the seventh grader, and her little sister, seven-year-old Amanda Jane, to wonder what had possessed her to flee like a reptile that quickly forgets her eggs. Their daddy, Paul, didn’t see it coming. Lena had always seemed like such a warm and fuzzy mommy, starching and ironing the pillowcases, singing along with the radio. But, really, how shocked could Paul afford to be? He took off one day’s personal leave from his job at the post office.</p>
<p>For nearly a week, the girls hardly ate a bite.  They stared at their pancakes with strawberry and whip cream topping. They stared at their Madame Alexander dolls, unable to touch them.  The last thing Paul could afford to do was suffer some breakdown himself.  What if they both turned wall-eyed anorexic?</p>
<p>Finally, though, the three began to watch TV in the evenings, but just the picture and hardly any sound. Then they actually turned it up loud enough to hear it. They started to shop at the mall a little bit on the week-ends, even though they didn’t want anything. Nothing looked pretty. They resumed playing board games together, eating pizza and other fast foods that made them smack their lips once again. It was eventually salt and grease that pulled them back into the land of the great mistaken whatever.</p>
<p>Twelve-year-old Denise was the first to get her hands on the postcard when it came. She pulled it from the mailbox and read it, immediately after school.  It prickled in her hands as she breathed harder.  She frantically penciled an ugly face with horns and a tail on the postcard before Paul got home from work.  After scratching the devil on the card, she ran to her room, completely hating the person who used to be her mother.  She slammed her bedroom door and turned on the radio full-blast. She now played the most hateful, brutal music she could find, and it made her feel steely and not easily bug-smashed.</p>
<p>She was secretly placing little sharp rocks in her shoes, actually inside her stocks and inside the feet of her tights so she could not kick them out while walking.  Nobody knew about the rocks. She was training herself for something. Whatever it was, she had no clue, but it was something important.  The rocks hurt a little bit, because some of them were sharp, annoying little irritants.  But whenever she put them in her socks in the morning, she got a very happy, anxious feeling.  It was a little weird, how she laughed to herself, and she didn’t say a word about it to anybody.  But it was happening more and more, ever since Lena had left them. Whenever she was alone in her room, Denise indulged in outrageous laughing fits, falling on the floor.  The whole of creation would suddenly strike her has hilarious and she would fall laughing uncontrollably, and then roll off the bed onto the floor, tears streaming from her eyes, laughing until she was gasping for breath.</p>
<p>Amanda Jane didn’t think anything was nearly that funny.  She would sit on her bed, in her yellow bedroom, and hug her giant teddy bear, barely breathing, like lichen that grows on rocks for centuries.</p>
<p>When she heard the screaming chainsaw of music in Denise’s room, she slipped in, quiet mouse, and turned it down. She picked up the postcard on Denise’s vanity and sighed, acknowledging, &#8220;At least she&#8217;s not dead.&#8221; Amanda had taken the abandonment under the radar, but Denise had slammed back hard, thundercloud to thundercloud, boasting and raving about those black-lipped Goth boys and girls who had their teeth filed into sharp points.  She might try that someday. She might tear the heads off of rabbits, too.  She had turned a very cold water hose in full spray on the neighbor’s cat and laughed for half an hour.</p>
<p>Denise said, “Toss me my brush.”</p>
<p>Amanda just stood there looking at the hairbrush.  It was full of Denise’s dark brown hair.</p>
<p>Denise said, “Are you deaf, Helen Keller? Toss me that damn brush.”</p>
<p>“Maybe I don’t want to.”</p>
<p>“God-damn it!”  Denise jumped off her bed and grabbed the brush and glared at Amanda Jane.  And then she began to brush her hair as Amanda Jane watched her violent strokes, as Denise ripped and tore through her tangles, breaking and popping strands, wincing at her own ruthless attack on her hair.</p>
<p>Amanda said, “Will you stop it!”</p>
<p>Denise laughed roughly and said, “Why, are you scared?”</p>
<p>Amanda said, “Stop hurting your hair!  Stop talking so bad!” She ran from the room as Denise continued to tear her hair to pieces.</p>
<p>Denise called out to her, “Ha! Poor little whiny baby!”</p>
<p>Paul got home from his job at the post office and confronted the message the estranged Lena had finally sent them. He leaned over the breakfast bar. No return address. Lena’s loopy backhanded writing held his eyes to the card:  &#8220;Dear cupcakes, I am fine. I have a brand new life. I am in love again.  Please get a new life, too.  Best Wishes, Lena.” Postmarked Sacramento, California.  The other side of the continent, far from their home.</p>
<p>Denise said, &#8220;Ain’t no cupcake. Wish she was dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Don’t say that,” said Paul.  “And why did you have to draw Satan on it?”</p>
<p>Denise said she thought it needed some artwork.</p>
<p>He puzzled at the message:  &#8220;In love again?”</p>
<p>Denise, glued to the images on TV but not listening to it, barked back at Paul: &#8220;Means she&#8217;s fucking some other guy!&#8221;  It was the first time she ever said the F-word to anyone.  It was a horrible sound and her mother deserved a foul dig, but the word sort of backfired and stung Denise as she said it.  She wanted to take it back, because her daddy had gasped to hear it come out of her mouth, but even more, she also wanted that hideous word to travel across the country and stab her mother, stab her smack in the middle of her new fucking life’s back.</p>
<p>The next morning, early in her sleep, Denise received a call from inside a redwood forest.  It was a young man who introduced himself to her as Poor Boy, with a crackling voice who spoke in spurts.  Calling from Fran San Sicko. He said he was a little Sicko Santo. There was wind in the redwoods and in his cell phone.  Sometimes it blew him away and he would come back clearer from another locale, his voice swinging on a vine in an earthquake.</p>
<p>She pieced together his message, though, and the truth was declared at last, and it brought her great relief:  Her mother Lena had died of an overdose, overnight. Heroin.  It was a car accident and the car had flipped twenty times and cut off her head.  Great.  Lena had gotten slut drunk and been run over by a freight train.  Wait a minute: Lena had actually fallen from a cliff and drowned in the cold Pacific. She had been immediately chewed to pieces by sharks.  Her mother Lena was dead dead dead.   Finally, it was certain. She was a hundred times dead and gone. Poor Boy said that she had died so many times, so many different ways,  that now there was nothing left of the body to send back home.</p>
<p>Poor Boy told Denise that he and Lena were married on a whim in Las Vegas with plastic rings and on their West Coast honeymoon headed for Nirvana together when tragedy struck them over and over.  In quantum space and time they sang songs with the wacked out motorcycle riders that had murdered both of them.  Poor Boy sounded like he was losing his mind in eternity.  Sometimes Denise could not figure out what he was saying.  Only that Lena was dead dead dead.</p>
<p>Denise burst into tears.  Poor Boy said he was very sorry, very sorry for everything. Poor Boy did not understand how she felt, really.  How could he be so dense?  Her tears were not from grief.  Oh no.  They were tears of absolute peace. Lena dead?  Like in a freak-car accident and smashed by a truck, drowned in the ocean and eaten by sharks?  Most wonderful news she&#8217;d heard in six months, ever since the mamma bitch had left them all to take care of themselves as she followed her own air-headed dreams.</p>
<p>But wait, said Poor Boy. Wooooo, said the wind as it cleaned off New Mexico and Arizona.  Big Sur ate Mamma clean off her bones.  Poor Boy wept to remember where he and Lena had first heard together the big Ohm. Denise listened quietly to his phone voice.  He hummed directly into her ear so that it tickled, Ooohhmma.</p>
<p>Poor Boy didn&#8217;t sound too healthy.  When he began to cry at the loss of his newly beloved, as he sobbed deeply, Denise could not help but laugh out loud at his mournful wailing. She told him to dry it up, and that is when his call finally dropped off the edge of the universe. She woke herself up laughing. Denise decided she would keep his message to herself, and she felt empowered with the secret of knowing the truth.  Daddy could believe that dumb postcard if he liked, that Lena was alive and had found a new life.  Denise preferred to believe Poor Boy’s report. Maybe it wasn’t a dream. Maybe it was real.  She relished the dream and replayed it in her head.  It made her feel comfy in a brand new way.</p>
<p>Finally she got up and told Paul and Amanda Jane that she felt puny. Sort of sick, she said. Of course, it was not true in the least.  She hadn’t felt this good since her mother had fled the house. Paul agreed she could stay home from school for the day, and she was playing Scrabble on the little laptop, sitting up in bed, when he left.</p>
<p>Later that morning, long after the bus had come and carried Amanda Jane to school, Denise walked through the house, into the kitchen breakfast nook. The linoleum floor felt pleasantly cool to her bare feet.  The light of mid morning fell softly upon her now that victory had come. Situated high on a triple shelf painted with hearts and rabbits and flowers, which her mother had toll-painted to hold her cherished egg collection, the priceless eggs smiled down at her. Denise and Amanda had watched, year by year, as Lena had pricked the end of the eggs and had carefully blown out the stream of yellow yolks and clear whites, before holidays, ever since they were old enough to remember.</p>
<p>She transformed the eggs into the Magical Egg People of the Land of Delicata, a concept that The Marvelous Mrs. Welch, Lena’s high school counselor, had sent in to a magazine and gotten published as a craft notion.  Lena sewed special clothes for them and decorated them with sequins for eyes, nose and mouth.  Hours and hours went into these masterpieces.   She often reminded Denise and Amanda Jane how they would someday inherit these precious collectibles, and that they must preserve them safely, even for their own little girls someday.  Lena had told them that if the country were to ever be invaded by an evil force, that the egg collection should be hidden and preserved above all things. She had been a mother who had looked far ahead into the future, earning their trust, year after hopeful year.</p>
<p>Denise studied the eggs perched upon their little altar:  Witch, Scarecrow, Quakers, Turkey, Pilgrims, and Hiawatha.   Santa Claus, Mrs. Claus and five precious elves. And the imperial Valentine king and queen of hearts. The demure Easter bonnet girls.  Paul Revere in a tri-cornered hat, Ben Franklin with his monocle, Uncle Sam with his top hat and stars and stripes.</p>
<p>Stupidest crap on earth.  How could she have failed to notice all these years the utter worthlessness of this trash before?  Sequins glittering for eyes?  Eggs in hats and dresses?  Oh, so highly valued, this handiwork of her nitwit mamma.</p>
<p>She dragged the folded step stool over and climbed up for one final assessment of them.  She lifted her hand in the air, ready to slap the silliness out of the entire Delicata kingdom.  But she halted.  Ah, the Valentine king and queen of hearts.  Maybe they weren&#8217;t absolutely ridiculous.  Tiny fourteen-karat gold foil crowns glittered.  Amanda Jane treasured them above the others and loved to stroke the queen&#8217;s red satin gown, white lacy ruff, and the king&#8217;s human hair wig of silvery white curled rows.  Thinking of Amanda, she lifted the fragile sweetheart royalty and set them aside with mercy, placing them apart.  It seemed like the only fair thing to do. Now Amanda wouldn&#8217;t cry.</p>
<p>Maybe one last picture of the Easter Bonnet girls would be nice.  She climbed down and got the iPad and came back and took a close-up of the egg girls in their mint green and daffodil yellow dotted Swiss dresses. Oh, what a fuss her mother had made over that dotted Swiss material!  Lena had stroked the flocked dots, the tiny little rows of bumps, cooing how it was the most interesting fabric to touch. “So classic, just like in Kate Greenaway,” Lena had said.</p>
<p>Staring at them, Denise almost touched the dotted Swiss one last time, but she stopped herself.  It wasn’t right to touch it.  It would make things too hard.  Things were already hard enough.</p>
<p>Turning back to the display, she lifted her arm, relishing in the moment before her mighty hand of destruction would fall.  With one murderous swipe, the egg-people flew through the air.  They sailed down and rolled in all directions over the kitchen floor.   Denise ran hungrily after each one, lifting her foot high above each precious idiot egg, imagining its terror to see Big Foot from Hell crashing down. Her laughter peeled through the entire house, a wild howling that seemed to come from someone else, as she stomped and grinded each one, and sometimes the broken edges of the shells pricked her feet.  Suddenly, she froze with her foot high in the air. This was the reason for the stupid little rocks in her socks!  “I’m BAAAD!” she shouted, realizing she wouldn’t be putting them down in her socks anymore.  Now it was time for maybe walking barefoot on softest fur: oh yes, Prince Charming, throw down a full-length mink coat, and another, and another, as I walk on.</p>
<p>She walked out of the kitchen and looked back at the mess on the floor, and then she walked back in, looking closely at each egg, most delighted with each special distortion powerful in ruination. She found the Easter Bonnet Girls.  Picking up the iPad once more, she captured them in their destroyed condition, so that she could have a Before and After shot.  The justice of the contrast was especially delicious to her. And so not like Kate Greenaway.</p>
<p>Thrilled with her footwork, she walked away, looking back on the crushed faces, glitter-eyes, and brains full of air, smashed on the linoleum exactly where they belonged.</p>
<p>The broom and dustpan waited for her in the utility room.  She swiped up the entire eggshell mess and took it into the back yard, sweeping her feet through the cool green grass.  In a little bonfire, some of the shells melted and crackled, and some of the acetate fabrics curled in the fire.  She felt clean as it all burned down and out to black flakes.  She dipped her finger in the ashes. The Magical Egg People of the Land of Delicata were dead dead dead.</p>
<p>So soothing to know. Minty cool dead, like finely crushed ice on a puffed skin blister. And for all the months that she had been tearing out her own hair when she brushed it, ripping the bristles through, with her eyes watering up and dropping tears from the pulling and snapping, she floated back into the house, sat down at her vanity in her bedroom, and slowly, she brushed her hair with tenderness, as if she were her own cherished doll, as if she were her own little girl.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The day after they scrape Eadie Pollard off the limestone two hundred feet below High Bridge, I walk the whole uphill mile to the Dixon Texaco and stop. Wiping sweat off my face, straddling cracked asphalt, I stand miniature under that big Texaco star and look straight up at the thing. Straining my neck. Those Texaco letters faded pink and curling at their edges like dead skin; the sign’s weight creaking in slow wind like some giant oak. I’m not going in, not even planning to. But I stand there for what feels like forever thinking about Lee—her probably sitting tanned and legs crossed on the Texaco’s stained counter. Her probably in there all alone.</p>
<p>I’m still standing out there alone between rows of rusted pumps when I hear the bell chime. See the door swing open. Watch Lee’s scarecrow shadow stop right next to the big star’s. She lifts a pack of Marlboros to her mouth, tears the plastic with vampire-white teeth.</p>
<p>“Been looking for you,” she says, that same tank top tight around her. That always-blue bikini underneath.</p>
<p>She cups a sideways flame, breathes in, and with her smoke swirling around me, I’m even sucking some of it in, letting it sting in my throat. I look up at my reflection in her glasses, at myself contorted and bulging in their lenses. My face something huge, almost alien.</p>
<p>“I’m guessing you heard,” she says.</p>
<p>I look down, away from her standing there, and feel that weird guilt twist around inside me. It wedges itself deep in my gut, presses like a fist into it, and I listen to her call it a shame, saying how terrible the whole thing was. How she can’t believe the poor girl was down there for maybe even weeks before anyone found her. That with it being so hot and all, and her down there cooking like thawed meat on those rocks. And that everyone’s saying it was Eadie’s own fault. That she did it herself.</p>
<p>Lee drops her cigarette, lets it go half-smoked. “You coming in?” she says.</p>
<p>Following her over these weeds pushing up through cracks in the concrete, through these pumps with counters stuck on old numbers, I’m thinking hard about Eadie. About the shape of her. The way she must have looked. And I’m wondering if any rust was still on her hands, or if what was left of the skin on her fingers was still cut from gripping the rail. Surely they checked, I’m thinking. Surely that’s how they knew.</p>
<p>Lee holds the door nearly all the way open and with the box fans blowing, with their air humming, she hops onto the counter first thing. Already she’s leaning over a lottery ticket, scraping rows of those metallic boxes with the dime between her fingers. “You knew her, didn’t you?” she says, lifting up the ticket, examining it. She tosses it into a heap of them and rips a row of fresh ones from the big dispenser. “Like, pretty close?”</p>
<p>Leaning against the counter, half-spinning a rack of cassettes with my fingers, I’m picturing that steeple—it pointed straight up and tall as the arms of trees, birds up there dodging its cross, and I imagine the church below it with doors swinging open, gushing people in bright clothes like a wound ripped open. The man up there with hair like shining metal. His suit coffin black. Standing there smiling and shaking every one of those hands.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I say, seeing Eadie there in front of me—her sitting Indian-style deep in the woods and peeling the sleeve of her jacket up both arms. The bruises on her like tiny planets.</p>
<p>Lee pushes a ticket my way on the counter and looks right at me. I tell her how I’ve never really been that lucky, how I doubt I’d ever be, but she slides a penny out of the plastic donation thing anyway and slaps it hard on the table. “Scratch,” she says.</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p>I’d heard it at school that same day. Reggie telling me right there in the cafeteria that his cousin was the one that had found her. That he’d been walking the rocks since the water was low, everything so dry. He’d walked right up on her and thought at first that she wasn’t even human. That she was some animal drowned from back when there was water.</p>
<p>I’m trying to picture this, what was left of her. What it was Reggie’s cousin saw. But Lee’s already ripped her last roll of tickets and she’s bent over them like she’s working on some small machine, scraping at them still and telling me about Harlan. About how he owns the place, how they’re related. About how he fills up jars with these pills he gets with fake prescriptions and hauls them by the truckload across the county’s line. How he let the gas pumps dry up years ago.</p>
<p>She’s still telling me all this when headlights grow big from the dusk outside and throw themselves through the glass, over the aisles. Lighting the whole place up, making it glow. And when the truck outside stops its rattle, Lee’s hushed. With its door creaking open, her voice is barely anything, telling me that we can meet outside, that she’ll be out in a minute. Then the sound of that little bell above the door. Of pointed boots clicking tile. It’s then that Lee nods outside and I turn to go, his smell like burnt wood. His arm brushing mine. I push against the doors without even looking, stopping at the pumps and turning to watch her there through the glass with her keys clinched tight in a fist and the man’s beard almost against her. She tries to push past him, even with him pulling, with his hand like rope around her arm, and when she finally does, when she’s free from his grip, he just stands there statue-like and facing the door, outside. Just standing there like that and watching the back of her.</p>
<p>She walks by me quick, offering a ride over her shoulder. Faking some weird kind of laugh and saying that it sure beats hoofing it, that a ride sure beats all that way in the dark. Then I’m following behind her and climbing into her Jeep, asking if it was him. If that was Harlan. But she just cradles the rearview with the inside of her hand and pulls it close to her face, staring straight into it and opening her mouth a little, smearing streaks of mascara across the bones of her cheeks, under each eye. She looks at me with still some of those charcoal stains down her face, saying: “Don’t have any plans, do you?” and turning the key, pressing hard on the clutch.</p>
<p>I crank down on the window, move the lever in circles with it squealing and rolling the glass slow. The air outside leaking in—this kind you can feel warm and like a hundred pounds in your lungs. This kind that slows everything down to a crawl.</p>
<p>“Plans?” I say.</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p>Cobain’s voice howls static through the Jeep’s speakers and I realize with it fading in, out, that we’re driving away from my house. Away even from town. I start to say something, to ask about it at least, but what’s left of the light from the sun’s bleeding through the trees in these little bits and pieces, and Lee’s turning the wheel, following the highway through the woods where it snakewinds up to the top and rolls itself like black carpet onto what I know is High Bridge.</p>
<p>“It’d be weird to stop, right?” she’s saying.</p>
<p>Still the whine of the music, that heavy sound of a guitar, and I’m asking her what she means. If she’s talking about Eadie. She nods her head yes, doesn’t even turn it. And with that knot tied in my stomach I wonder again about Eadie, about her hands on the rail. Her fingers around the rust of it. I imagine her leaning over, looking down all the way. Squinting to see the bottom of her two hundred feet.</p>
<p>Lee drives the bridge’s length and turns into an opening off to the side—a road that works its way down and after a while fades to gravel, dried mud. We follow it as far as it goes, until it opens into a clearing and dead-ends at the bank under these huge tops of trees, all the kudzu. Down here where it’s darker—hard to see even.</p>
<p>She shuts off the engine and we both climb out, her keys like copper pennies on the floorboard’s metal. Then just the moaning of cicadas. The sloshing of a bottle she pulls from under her seat. She walks out in front with it, smiling at me and holding the thing up like a kind of trophy. “Stole it,” she says, still swinging it by its throat, walking already toward the water. She says to me, to no one really: “The fucking creep,” and walks out to where the trees open up at the bank like the mouth of a cathedral—the entrance to some pale and dried up apocalypse with rocks bone white and puddles of dying river scattered across it all like the left-behind of some weak storm. Like the clouds didn’t have enough in them. The main stream flowing through it like syrup, winding thin and shrunken through the middle, and Lee’s already sitting above it, her legs together like a queen on top of the limestone. I climb it and scoot close and she hands me the bottle, cap already gone. I’m tracing the raised parts of it with my finger, getting a good feel for its weight. My hand fits perfect around the curve of its neck.</p>
<p>“Jesus,” she says. “Just drink it.”</p>
<p>I try and laugh and tilt it back without thinking, hear the stuff echo inside the glass. It slides warm into my gut and she’s already taking it back, downing another swig.</p>
<p>She winces a little, shows her teeth. “The fucking creep,” she says.</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p>The bottle’s almost empty when the moon’s over us dead center, and with the landscape soaked in bright dark Lee’s sliding a lighter from the pocket of her shorts, leaning hunched over and getting a flame first try. She sucks some of it in. That sound of burning.</p>
<p>“He does things, you know.” She arches her neck a little and breathes out, the smoke leaking from her like an engine dying. “Like, things to me.”</p>
<p>I ask who, already knowing the answer, remembering Harlan’s face pressed almost against hers and his mouth moving in words I couldn’t make out. I keep this image there, hold onto it, and try to make myself upset. Telling myself that I’m here for some kind of reason, that I should right some kind of wrong.</p>
<p>“Him. Harlan. Dad. Whatever.”</p>
<p>But sitting where I am, with the light like it is, I can see perfectly her tattoo—this moon skinny and waning and etched like a hieroglyphic into her shoulder. The way it hangs on her, bends with her shape, it looks almost like ink still wet, and I’m imagining the black of it dripping, leaking like water through Harlan’s fingers. His hands huge and gripping the tan of her skin like a motorcycle’s throttle.</p>
<p>“Did it to Mom too,” she says. “It’s why she ran off in the first place.”</p>
<p>I push the thought away and reach toward her, thinking for a second about grabbing her hand, lacing fingers. Telling her about Eadie, about the man with slicked hair. About railings, Reggie’s cousin. How these bodies, they find their way down here all time. But my hand finds the bottle instead, prying it from her grip, and I turn it upside down before the words can even come out.</p>
<p>She drops her cigarette and falls rockheavy onto my shoulder. And almost reading my mind she’s asking if I ever wonder what it feels like. With the sweat of her wet against my neck, she’s asking about dying. About the feeling of it. “You know,” she says. “Like Eadie.”</p>
<p>I look out through the trees, at the outline of High Bridge stretched across everything, and think about how small she must have looked up there. How at that high the bottom must not even look real.</p>
<p>“That moment you just feel nothing,” Lee says. She falls from my shoulder, in almost slow motion, with her arms dropping slack. Her eyes already shut. “Then never waking up.”</p>
<p>I drain the bottle and pitch it high behind me. Hear the thud of it punching earth. I look down at Lee, at her just lying there, chest rising and falling like something artificial. Like some kind of doll. Her body laid out and limp and spread on the rock like wet laundry, surrendering out here under hardwoods, the limestone piles. The weeds that choke everything. And I know no one’s watching. I know that sounds out here can lose themselves in the nothing and that even spilling yourself on these rocks would probably only be loud for a few seconds.</p>
<p>I reach over and pull a strand of blond from her cheek and run my hand down the side of her face, around her jaw. Feeling the bone of it. Then I lean over, looking down, and see the robin egg freckles under her makeup, feel her breath like steam on my face. I hold my head still to keep it from spinning and hover over her real slow until I feel her there. Until my mouth sticks to hers like flytrap paper. Until I taste her air in my throat. And under these stars as big as the Texaco’s, her hips come to life. Out here in the quiet of this used-to-be river, she presses against me and her legs tie around me in knots. Her nails dragging my skin like keys cutting clear coat. And the whole time I’m on top of this girl playing Eadie, this almost-carcass on the peak of these rocks, I’m thinking about impact. Bones hitting bottom. Reggie’s cousin kicking buzzards, the birds taking pieces right out of her. Chunks like your fist, Reggie had said, telling me this the way he’d tell anything else. Nothing scared anywhere on his face. Just talking instead like someone mentioning the weather.</p>
