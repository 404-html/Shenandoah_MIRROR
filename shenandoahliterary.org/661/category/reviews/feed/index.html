								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/661/2016/12/27/hillbilly-elegy-a-memoir-of-a-family-and-a-culture-by-j-d-vance-harper-2016/hillbilly/" rel="attachment wp-att-273"><img class="alignleft wp-image-273" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/661/files/2016/12/hillbilly-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" /></a>Perhaps in part because I live at the foot of the Appalachians and occasionally teach the region’s literature, I was eager to read J. D. Vance’s best-selling <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em>.  And I’ll admit that my enthusiasm was amplified by Vance’s appearances on CNN political shows, where he was enlisted, effectively, as an expert on the frustration, anger and near-hopelessness of the divested and marginalized natives of the Appalachian highlands and their kin who have moved to the Midwest in search of employment and dignity.  I was, however, disappointed with the book, and by the time I reached the last chapters, I realized that the disappointment was to some degree my fault.</p>
<p>The subtitle of the book is <em>A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis</em>, but the gap between my expectations and the reality of the book is the result of the main title.  “Hillbilly Elegy<em>”</em> is an inviting phrase, because the two words are born of such different diction and their pairing implies a willingness to forego the euphemisms about superficial identity of Appalachians and avoid the distraction of linguistic niceties.  “Hillbilly” suggests candor and transgression; “elegy” suggests both erudition and lamentation for the loss of something precious, perhaps even beyond prosperity.  I expected a book exploring a culture and its identity crises, but Vance’s book is really a more personal memoir, which succeeds in portraying his early navigation through a family beset with the habits and attitudes that currently assail the poor and uneducated highlanders who migrate when mining plays out in their region.  But its focus is, for about three-quarters of the book, much narrower, as if the larger picture of Appalachian culture and history can be adequately represented by one clan’s difficulties, awful and pitiable as they are.</p>
<p>In that focal capacity, the personal story is effective and alarming.  The drug addiction, violence, premature procreation, dearth of hope and widespread of denial all play a role in the defeat of every family member less disciplined, intelligent and lucky than the author.  Along his path from Jackson, Kentucky (and Middletown, Ohio) to the Marine Corps, Yale Law and on to Silicon Valley, Vance reveals a rogue’s gallery of people he calls “hillbillies,” evidently intending to show that he pulls no punches and toes no politically correct line.  I suspect the true driving force behind the book is a desire to explore and perhaps explain how he can love his people while detesting most of their actions and beliefs.</p>
<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/661/2016/12/27/hillbilly-elegy-a-memoir-of-a-family-and-a-culture-by-j-d-vance-harper-2016/j-d-vance/" rel="attachment wp-att-274"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-274" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/661/files/2016/12/J-D-Vance-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>Unfortunately, his decision to shoot from the hip does not protect him from clichés of situation and language, generalities and digressions.  One acute longing I felt reading this book was to experience the sensory vigor of a life attentively lived, for arrestingly acute observations and provocative contrasts.  And to be fair, Vance is handy with the demographics and predictable conflicts, while he occasionally turns a pithy anecdote certifying his family’s routine dysfunction and occasional sacrifice.  Unfortunately (and he readily admits this) the story he tells is not limited to mountain people and not very different from the adversity that besets urban African Americans.  He also mentions, but only briefly, that there is Appalachian life beyond the pattern his family follows.</p>
<p>Even more greedy, I also wanted to hear the sound of genuine Appalachian dialogue, those neologisms and transgressive figures of speech that approach poetry (like &#8220;nar a steam to go around” or “wallop my dodger, if you please”), instead of being told that mountain people have a saying – “too big for his britches” – a phrase long ensconced in the mainstream of American slang.  I most wanted to see how problems &#8212; like the proclaimed respect for hard work he records from those who exhaust their ingenuity avoiding it – are exacerbated and given mythic status in the midst of a contrarian culture which inspires both scorn and admiration.</p>
<p>So Vance’s title, and his TV persona, gave me an appetite for a book which he was not on a mission to write.  My error.  Truth is, when a book says “memoir” on the  cover, I’m inclined to spring in the other direction.  But I took a chance, figuring that one who loved literature as much as Vance says he does would be familiar with the word work of everyone from Lee Smith (say <em>Saving Grace</em>) to Ron Rash (perhaps <em>The World Made Straight</em>), Charles Frazier to Charles Wright, Wendell Berry and Harriet Arnow.  In short, I wanted to hear about the evolution, amid economically-driven diaspora, of those features of mountain life which invited and nourished the famous hillbilly pride – the music and storytelling, the resourcefulness (right down to but not emphasizing moonshining), the timbering legacy, hunting, mining, union life, ecology, animal husbandry, agriculture, medicine, humor, matters ethnographic, demographic and linguistic.  These are not subjects I wanted instead of the recent history of the Blanton-Vance story – ending in the high cotton of law school, beautiful wife, affluence – but rather broader matters which I wanted to see the Blanton-Vances negotiating.  I wanted the larger historical, spiritual, aesthetic context, and though the author touches briefly on religion, he seems unengaged with even the various robust kinds of faith that still both staunch and hobble Appalachians today.  In short, Appalachian culture extends far beyond his topical and personal use of the term, and even when his family didn’t practice many Appalachian virtues, they may have been living in the midst of them.</p>
<p>The rogue but loving grandmother with a foul mouth and an aptitude for firearms seems important to the tale, and she gets more backstory than most, but mountain music, dancing, instrument making, highland craft, generosity and suspicion all deserve to play a larger role and set the stage for Vance’s Horatio Alger chronicle.  What would have gone a long way toward satisfying me?  The author seems to feel that very few sources other than family memory and economic analyses would help a reader understand why one particular region was the perfect (and ironic) locale for his pilgrim’s progress.  I wish he had spent a few hours with the U. of Tennessee Press’s <em>Encyclopedia of Appalachia</em>, some time reading creative works like those of Robert Morgan, Denise Giardina, Anne and Breece Pancake, Chris Offutt.  A journey through the photographic albums of Shelby Lee Adams would have provided valuable touchstones, and some hours listening to Doc Watson and Dock Boggs, Earl Scruggs and Vassar Clements, Ralph Stanley and Jean Richie.  The hymns and murder ballads, the Jack tales and rusties.  I suppose I wanted to see how his story and those which it parallels exists in relation to the Foxfire books, the early research of Horace Kephart, Williams’ <em>Appalachia: A History</em>, Drake’s <em>A History of Appalachia</em>, or Tom Burton’s lively books about folk customs and religious practices.  In short, the story Vance tells loses force when isolated (or nearly so) from the truth and falsity of common notions concerning “the hillbilly.”  While there is no substitute for personal experience and word of mouth, he might have cast a wider net for a richer catch.</p>
<p>I hope it’s clear what I’m suggesting here: you can’t get a good grip on Appalachian Culture and the people who are genuinely enmeshed in it unless you address Appalachian folk culture, which is soil and seed and weather from which contemporary migrant Appalachians have sprung.  Their journey from the hills to the cities may be an alternative to what Weston la Barre calls a “crisis cult” in <em>They Shall Take Up Serpents</em>, his landmark study of serpent handling believers.  How much richer this story might have been against the backdrop of  the Carters, Hazel Dickens, courting dulcimers and beekeeping, mountain heroes from the Skillet Lickers to those who follow “The Sacred Harp.”  Acuff  and lumbering, hunting and Tommy Jarrell, railroading, the cultivation and employment of ginseng and other herbs.</p>
<p>When I think of Hillbillies (rabbit twisters, stump jumpers – mountain dialect is full of synonyms), I think of resourceful and sometimes desperate people who suffer the deprivations and inspirations of living on the margins.  In this memoir we see plenty of what they have to be ashamed of, but the balancing measure in their equation would involve the indigenous acts and beliefs they are proud of.  The interplay between these and how the narrator of the book paddles upstream in this rough current would have taken longer to write and hunger for a wider vision.  It would probably be less timely and topical, though perhaps just as political, but it’s not a volume destined for the best seller list, though I hope Vance will try his hand at it anyway.</p>
<p>I’d like to imagine Vance spending an evening tapping his feet to Vassar Clements’ fiddle (&#8220;Orange Blossom Special,&#8221; for starters), an afternoon gawking and arguing at Ferrum College’s fall Folklife Festival, a weekend with<em> Cold Mountain</em> and <em>Saving Grace</em>.  None of his discoveries would be likely to crowd out what he has already recorded, but the result might be more lament than complaint, and here’s hoping that, though “misery” may belong in the title, perhaps he will find that “elegy” is a touch premature.<a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/661/2016/12/27/hillbilly-elegy-a-memoir-of-a-family-and-a-culture-by-j-d-vance-harper-2016/fid/" rel="attachment wp-att-280"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-280" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/661/files/2016/12/fid-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>

		<title>ALLEGHENY FRONT by Matthew Neill Null</title>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/661/2016/12/23/263/allegheny/" rel="attachment wp-att-264"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-264" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/661/files/2016/12/allegheny-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>Matthew Neill Null, recipient of the Joseph Brodsky Rome Prize, among other accolades, follows up his novel <em>Honey from the Lion </em>(2015) with a collection of short stories entitled <em>Allegheny Front </em>(2016)<em>. </em>Though his time is now split between Provincetown, Massachusetts and his native home of West Virginia, there is no question which location had its influence on the collection of stories. The mountain heritage and unique regional characteristics are vividly painted throughout each story and his expertise is never in question. Null’s use of native jargon and region-specific activities of hunting, fishing and rafting immerses the reader in the lifestyle of the natives through stories depicting rural life in the 20<sup>th</sup> century (with a few exceptions) and the reliance on and connection to nature. In this collection, readers will find themselves in the rural backcountry of West Virginia, whether it’s with a plow salesman or a fish researcher, and will gain the perspectives of the rather ruthless, male-dominated, and harsh life these people lead.</p>
<p>While most of the pieces in the collection follow the trials of the native peoples’ lives, three of them fail to fall into place with the others. “Natural Resources,<em>”</em> third in the series, is one of these. The essay style account reads as an informational piece on the black bear population in Tuscarora County and contains no main characters, climax, or traditional plot. The collective lives of the bears &#8212; from their decline in numbers to protected, then overpopulated, and back to scarce again &#8212; are used by Null to depict the way of life of these people; describing the bear spectacles attended by folks from all over as “…the poor man’s safari.” Though there is no focus or connection to a main character in “Natural Resources,” Null is able to generalize these peoples’ ways of life, excusing that “In the country you make your own fun,” referring to the bear chases that were for sheer entertainment. The lack of connectivity to the reader due to the absence of characters, plot and climax gives the impression that this piece is unfinished as well as unnecessary to the collection, as it does not positively contribute to the set.</p>
<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/661/2016/12/23/263/null/" rel="attachment wp-att-270"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-270" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/661/files/2016/12/null-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://shenandoahliterary.org/661/files/2016/12/null-150x150.jpg 150w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/661/files/2016/12/null.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>“The Island in the Gorge of the Great River,” sixth in the series, is another piece that fails to flow with the rest of the stories. Not only does it seem disconnected from the others in terms of theme, erring more on the side of mystical and romantic than realistic, it lacks the deep-rooted rural nature that the other stories prominently display. The grimness of the isolated island on the other side of this “…brute river, the New, so unruly that the coal had to be hauled out by rail,” where the sick and dying are rowed across and isolated, contributes to a small-town-in-Europe-during-the-black-plague feel rather than somewhere in the Allegheny Mountains in the 1890’s. The story lacks the key indicators of jargon and nature so prevalent in the other stories. The only regional hints the reader gets are from names like John Drew and Burl, and the imperfect grammar and use of “them.” For example, “I feel bad for them people. I do. But the county’s damned foolish. People use that water. My God, them nurses washing and burning rags and burying, and just hells of people downriver.” Even the dialect lacks the distinct tones found in the other stories.</p>
<p>The second story in the collection, “Mates,<em>”</em> successfully combines nature, animals, activities and personalities that are all common to the area. It is more successful than others in the collection in creating empathetic characters while also helping readers gain better insight into what life in the Alleghenies is like. Sull Mercer is a native of the area and is more grounded in his ways than the trees on his property. His life of hunting and religion, and his lack of care for and understanding of the world outside his own, serves as a good guide to understand the natives values and priorities. The firearms terminology throughout the piece, how the .270 is “scoped with a 3&#215;9 Leupold&#8230;,” shows how integral and necessary hunting is to their lives, a vast contrast to the urban world today. The cynical and stubborn nature of Sull will enthrall readers and force them to walk in the worn boots of a true outdoorsman.</p>
<p>The most successful of the stories is the last one, “In the Second District<em>.</em>” The only story narrated in the first person, it effectively connects the reader to the characters’ thoughts and feelings on a deeper level. The story follows Roosevelt Daugherty, the son of the county chair for the Democratic party, who is facing an identity crisis similar to one seen in an earlier story “Telemetry”<em>;</em> knowing where one’s roots lie, but wanting to sever them. At times Null struggles with wording, creating accidental and out of place puns like “His face was red as his beard. <em>Gingerly</em> [my ital.], Conner unlaced Andy’s boot and slipped it off him.” These awkward descriptions and word choices don’t detract from this story nearly as much as they do from others, which could be credited to the use of the first person.</p>
<p>Though at times the flow of the collection is disrupted by the lack of cohesion between stories, Null still successfully submerges the reader into the adverse culture that is the Allegheny Mountains of West Virginia. For those looking to traverse through the woods into a world different from their own, and don’t mind a few rivers and logs across their path, <em>Allegheny Front</em> would make for a fine read. Null tried his hand at a difficult task in the matters of culture and language, especially as such a young writer, and it is an indication of even stronger books to come.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/661/2016/11/03/hard-lines-rough-south-poetry/hardlines/" rel="attachment wp-att-32"><img class="alignleft wp-image-32" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/661/files/2016/09/hardlines.jpg" alt="hardlines" width="160" height="239" /></a>Hard Lines: Rough South Poetry</em>.  Daniel Cross Turner and William Wright, editors. Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 2016.</p>
<p>Editor William Wright  introduces this collection of “rough southern poetry,” two hundred poems by sixty contemporary poets, in this way:<br />
As well as its centering on the darker side of southern experience, Dan and I want with this volume to revivify literature-loving audiences with an exposure to poets who have for some decades formed the heart of southern poetry; second we wish to introduce readers to poets perhaps unfamiliar but who we think will become significant facets in southern literature.</p>
<p>Epithets like “hostile spit, grit, grime, and gristle” abound in the editors’ intros. No “nightingales tender as the night” here, no Margaret Mitchell stuff either (as if anyone believed it these days), but a poetry that “keeps things real.” Meaning “serpents, cockfighting, rabid cats.”  Jim Dickey’s “Wild to be wreckage forever” seems the mantra for <em>Hard Lines</em>, and a reader may come to feel that the editors insist too much on it. For one thing, it omits a lot of  contemporary southern poets and poetry, and a canny reader might make his own list of omissions, as with any anthology.</p>
<p>Dickey is represented by”Canebrake,” “Cherrylog Road,” and the wonderful “The Sheep Child,” which on first appearance in <em>The Atlantic Monthly</em> in August, 1966, brought down a snowstorm of subscription cancellations, but which otherwise could teach a beginning poet a lot about smart ways to skirt questionable taste.  Perhaps victims of “the complex world of permissions,” Archie Ammons and Robert Penn Warren are absent, even though Warren’s brilliant <em>Audubon: A Vision, </em>(with only three lynchings) is declared to “brim with gore,” like a poetic slasher movie.  Each of the standard list of contemporary southern stars (canny reader necessary here, too) is represented by from one to four poems, as are the lesser-known poets. Traditional forms are represented as well, with sonnets, sonnet-sequences,  a villanelle, and ballad stanzas, among others, and these poems often have a narrative basis, proof that the Scotch-Irish and Irish roots of southern story-telling endure.</p>
<p>What isn’t here are poems their authors think you have all day every day to decipher, the Higher Gibberish and <em>non sequiturs</em> that regularly appear in some Big Apple Sunday venues, and the ones that illustrate the dictate to “Make it goofy.” There’s not a lot of the relentlessly clever here either, all of which is to say <em>Hard Lines</em> is very readable.</p>
<p>Characters in these poems sometimes see things which may or may not be there, have wild uncles, whole disfunctional families, and crazy dogs. There are weird businesses like “Wildman’s Civil War Surplus and Herb Shop.” There’s assorted violence, bar fights, lynchings, people vs. animal  contests. Sometimes a bit of honest dialect creeps in: “It is with his death I fear my own/ before the loving here gets as open/ as it might could get in such as me?” Or “Like circus posters/ After the show’s done/ Gone.” Fred Chappell’s “The Artful Dodger Out of the Bag” seems to be told by a cat. Animals get skinned, which you rarely find in poems from other parts of America. Same with bootlegging, and despite the fact that many of these poets have graduate degrees in Creative Writing, there’s a lot of  physical labor, digging holes, packing crates, fixing truck engines.There’s Linda Parsons Marion’s “Chicken Pickin’ ”and TJ Jarrett’s “There’s a solace in broke-down cars: you can find what/ / is broken. You can make it whole again.” The accusation that poets these days have spent their lives in the classroom would be wasted here.</p>
<p>Strangely, there is not a lot about Hurricane Katrina, given its violence to New Orleans, and I want to register a personal complaint that “Some Enormous Surprises,” a heartbreaker about the childhood of Adolph Hitler, is not included among George Garrett’s poems, though this too may be the result of “the complex world of permissions.”</p>
<p>As for eye-opening discoveries, one is Hastings Hensel’s “Filet,” almost a single sentence that the reader could follow in order to clean a fish:</p>
<pre>
The thin blade bends
              in fish skin
saws along the shoulder,
              fins, extends
through belly and breast,
             comes clean out
the other side, swept
              in air where
the eye has hardened
             to a marble . . .</pre>
<p>And sixteen lines later, a few quick similes but the poet always on the job, a proof  of experience,  and that the instruction poem, once fairly common, hasn’t gone out of business: </p>
<pre>
Then the stray
  shards of bone
discarded, the blood--
             flecks washed
away from the smooth
             grooves of vein.</pre>
<p>Or another kind of experience, from Sheryl St. Germain’s “Addiction,” in which shooting up and the sexual are paired by the speaker as “joy/ at any cost”:</p>
<pre>Like that I would enter him,
slowly, slowly, very still,
don’t move, 
then he would let the fist out,
loosen his grip on the upper arm--


and oh, the movement of his lips
when he asked that I open my arms.
How careful,
how good he was, sliding
the needle silver and slender
so easily into me, as though
my skin and veins were made for it,
and when he had finished, pulled
it out, I would be coming
in my fingers, hands, my ear lobes
were coming, heart, thighs,
tongue, eyes and brain were coming,
thick and brilliant as the last thin match
against a homeless bitter cold.</pre>
<p>Wild to be wreckage forever, indeed. John Lane’s “The Day Andy Griffith Died” takes on the romanticized South directly: “TV shows don’t have/ themes you whistle anymore. No one names a character/ Ernest T. Bass or Opie, Goober, or Gomer.” Lane is perhaps too kind to mention that Aunt Bee, whose character actually became attached to cookbooks, was played by an actress who in real life ended up dying in isolation in North Carolina with fourteen cats and no electricity, a rough south resolution if there ever was one. Mayberry “never existed,/ only lived like a wisp of smoke up somebody’s fake/ chimney.”  Lane exposes the cast “bleached white/ like the grits on [his] breakfast table,” that “Andy left Helen Crump/ at the church dance,” and Opie the film director lives seasonally in a condo at Hilton Head. Contemporary southern reality, this poet affirms, is wilder than <em>Gone with the Wind</em> and “Mayberry” when we have Cracker Barrel, Graceland, the Gourd Museum, and a state university whose mascot is an okra wearing boxing gloves.</p>
