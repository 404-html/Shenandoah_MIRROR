								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond Autobiography: Claudia Emerson Through Three Poems on Race</span><br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">To live in hearts we leave behind is not to die</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212; “Curing Time”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">      Claudia Emerson did not write many poems about race. In fact, in the seven collections she published between 1997 and 2015, only three poems appear that explicitly address the topic. The poems for which Emerson is best known—perhaps a majority of the poems in these seven books—employ a voice that is, or feels to the reader to be, autobiographical. There is, particularly now only two years removed from Emerson’s death, a powerful temptation to let her biography overshadow the strength of her poems. One can find easily in the poems reflections of the poet’s childhood and adolescence in rural Virginia, her tenures as the academic dean of a girls’ school and a rural mail carrier, the end of her first marriage, deaths of her father and brother, her second marriage, and the dread and courage with which she faced the cancer that caused her death at 57 on December 4, 2014. Yet, the poignancy of the biographical details, felt by many through the poems of the Pulitzer-winning third volume, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Late Wife </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(LSU Press, 2005), does not fully account for the resonance Emerson’s poems have with so many of her readers. Her subject, often broadly but inadequately categorized as loss, is hardly unique. There is no shortage of lives marked by sorrow, the realization that everyone is one or two generations away from oblivion. Those hearts one leaves behind and in which one may live for a time die, too. Some makers, however, leave behind artifacts that remind future generations what is was like to live in their time, in their circumstances, and do so in a way that commands attention in the present. Whether future readers turn to Emerson’s poems depends upon the vagaries of taste and, perhaps, the tenacity of critics. For now, there is much to appreciate, and one way to approach Emerson more objectively is to look not at poems that bear significant biographical weight but at the group of three poems addressing race, poems that may allow readers to understand not only that Emerson’s poems are powerful but that they are made so by Emerson’s meticulous attention to her craft.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not until “Elevator Operator, Danville Virginia, 1964” (hereinafter “Elevator Operator”) in her fourth volume, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figure Studies</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (LSU Press, 2008), does the first implication of race appear in Emerson’s poems. Here is the poem in its entirety.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All day she ferried them—almost all</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">women, all white—as they rose to fall</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">in strict passage, the gondola close to airlessness,</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">curfew-dark. She filled the forward corner, perched</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">on a small, fold-down stool from which she could</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">reach with ease both the lever and the collapsing</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">metal lattice of the door. All day she closed</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">them in like perfumed birds rustling nylons,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">shopping bags, purses—and released them again</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">to the few destinations she had to repeat, announcing:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">third floor</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">men’s wear</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">mezzanine</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">—unseen steel</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">cables controlling all of them in endless,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">storied looping. Only children saw her until</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">most learned not to, looking up instead to the dial</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">above the door, its face an eclipsed compass,</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">the ornate brass needle of her voice</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">sweeping east to west to east by the northern </span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">route—as though the south were never there.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Elevator Operator, Danville, Virginia, 1964” By Claudia Emerson, from FIGURE STUDIES: POEMS, copyright © 2008 by Claudia Emerson. Reprinted by permission of Louisiana State University Press.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surely many readers are drawn to Emerson by the precision of her imagery and the gift of metaphor that makes it spark. Because criticism is in significant part a task of comparison and discrimination, it seems appropriate to site one or two other examples of imagery by which one might consider its effects and thereby add to the discussion of Emerson’s approach. An obvious choice for one example are the Dickinson lines that Emerson employed as the epigraph for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Opposite House</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (LSU Press, 2015): “There’s been a Death, in the Opposite House, / As lately as Today— / I know it, by the numb look / Such Houses have—alway—”. If genius is evidenced by a poet’s ability to address a universal subject in a new way, Dickinson surely had it. She approaches the subject of death not directly by describing its consequences for the mourners but by describing the countenance of the houses—the “numb look” of the house in which someone has died. The success of this image derives, in part, from its uniqueness—its simultaneous strangeness and familiarity—and its resulting capacity to foment questions in the mind of the reader. In this instance, one might wonder, given the slow-changing nature of a house’s constructed façade, whether houses ever look any other way. Would the exterior of a house in which a birth just occurred look any different than a house that death has recently visited? What does it mean for a house to appear “numb,” and what would the opposite of that look be?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The power of an image, however, results not only from its originality. The words selected by the poet to express the image—the poet’s diction—combine with the relevant metaphor to press the image into the reader’s mind. In “The Cows at Night,” Hayden Carruth offers an example of how precision of diction and metaphor are essential to conveying an effective image:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet I like driving at night</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">in summer and in Vermont:</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">the brown road through the mist</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">of mountain-dark, among farms</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">so quiet, and the roadside willows</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">opening out where I saw</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">the cows. Always a shock</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">to remember them there, those</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">great breathings close in the dark. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Cows at Night” By Hayden Carruth, from FROM SNOW AND ROCK, FROM CHAOS, copyright © 1973 by New Directions Publishing Corp. Reprinted by permission of New Directions Publishing Corp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scene Carruth describes would have been common in the rural Vermont. The setting and the image are pastoral and hardly unique. The mental image alone—the picture in the reader’s mind—is not the element that makes these lines memorable. In lesser hands, the poem might be ruined by slipping into sentimentality; in this case, it is not a long journey. The language, however—“those / great breathings close in the dark”—removes the image from the snare of sentiment and allows this poem to endure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the great pleasures of reading Claudia Emerson’s poems is finding that she, like Dickinson and Carruth, has the imaginative capacity and the verbal dexterity to create endurable images in poem after poem and that she exhibited this in each of her seven volumes of poetry. Although Emerson surely developed and grew as a poet over the course of her writing career, this ability was abundantly and powerfully evident in all of her books, including </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pharaoh, Pharaoh </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(LSU Press, 1997). In that first volume’s “Romantic Fever,” one can see Emerson’s talent for imaginative description in the last stanza as the speaker describes a night in her recovery from rheumatic fever: “That night I lay harbored in the darkness, / watching the doomed fireflies rise; easier / to believe the stars had fallen, crippling / in the trees. In the damp grass one lay flat / on its back, coughing up light.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subtlety, too, sometimes plays a role in Emerson’s imagery. In “Elevator Operator,” the poet never says explicitly that the elevator operator, a woman, is black. In the first and seventh stanzas, Emerson hints strongly that the woman is black, first by noting the opposite for all of the elevator passengers—“almost all / women, all white”—and secondly by noting that the elevator operator was noticed only by children “until / most learned not to . . . .” Yet, the weight of the poem’s comment about race is born not by these more obvious, though still oblique, references to race but by the underlying image of the slave trade, interestingly reversed here to characterize the white occupants as captives. The elevator is a water-venturing vessel—a “gondola”—and the passengers are “ferried” from floor to floor and back again. The poem closes with a characteristic punch, “as though the south were never there,” but the power in that line derives from the description of the elevator car as a slave ship, its interior “close to airlessness.” Emerson mentions the light as “curfew-dark,” a more contemporary allusion, but it is her references to the elevator’s “strict passage,” its “storied looping,” the “compass” of the elevator floor dial, and the dial’s “sweeping east to west to east by the northern / route” that imprint in the reader’s mind the horror and complexity of the elevator operator’s circumstance and call to mind the Middle Passage, the slave route from Africa to the Americas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strength of this poem is also enhanced by Emerson’s use of one of her favorite images—birds. Birds figure prominently in Emerson’s poems, sometimes as the putative subject and sometimes metaphorically. This is an instance of the latter. Readers will first note that the elevator operator herself, the pilot of the gondola, is “perched” on her corner stool. The passengers appear to be birds of a different sort, “perfumed birds rustling nylons, // shopping bags, purses”, and the operator “released them . . . to the few destinations she had to repeat . . . .” Both the operator and the passengers are birds, but these passengers are released from the claustrophobic environment of the boat’s hold. But to what are they released? All of the players here are controlled by steel and are caught in the endless loop—a different kind of captivity perhaps. Emerson is not suggesting that the plight of the passengers is the equivalent of slavery; it is the elevator operator who cannot escape. Yet, the reversal that turns the passengers into caged birds with few available destinations does point at something involuntary, a kind of servitude that is perhaps more subtle and not recognized—but maybe felt— by the captives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As noted above more generally, the power of imagery and metaphor is inseparable from the poet’s diction. The poet cannot recreate in the reader’s mind the image that is in hers without the medium of language, and Emerson’s diction provides that effective vehicle consistently. One might consider how “Elevator Operator” would be diminished if Emerson used words other than “ferried” (line 1), “passage” (line 3), “perched” (line 4), “controlling” (line 12), “compass” (line 15), and “route” (line 18). The words do at least double duty. They work in their denotative role to move the short narrative forward, but their connotations give the poem its power and its edge. The poem with other word choices might serve nicely as a description of segregated society in Danville, Virginia in the mid-sixties, but Emerson’s diction enables the reader to understand not only one particular historical moment but to feel the weight of a centuries-long injustice. Yet the poet never makes an overt statement about race. That is remarkable; that is poetry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Careful readers will also notice other formal elements that make “Elevator Operator” something more than an engaging picture of racial segregation in the south. One should assume until disappointed that every aspect of a poem is there for a reason. That is certainly the case with Emerson’s poems. What, then, should one make of the stanza form of “Elevator Operator”? Readers will notice an arc in the poet’s stanza forms over the course of her seven volumes. The poems in Emerson’s first two collections, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pharaoh, Pharaoh</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinion: an elegy </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(LSU Press, 2002), were written in long stanzas, often with dropped lines, that suited the predominately narrative nature of the poems. With </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Late Wife</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one notices a distinct shift to more structured stanzas; the poems are written in couplets (many with a stranded last line), tercets, and quatrains. Section III, “Letters to Kent,” contains mostly sonnets. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figure Studies</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in which “Elevator Operator” appears, is written entirely in unrhymed couplets with justified left margins. The poems in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secure the Shadow</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (LSU Press, 2012) retain distinct forms—sestets, octaves, etc.—but often employ alternately or sequentially indented lines, much like those in the “Divorce Epistle” poems in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Late Wife.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Many of the poems in Section One of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Opposite House </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">employ the longer, narrative structure of the poems in Emerson’s first two volumes. Each poem in Section Two, “Early Elegies,” consists solely of single eight-line stanzas, but Section Three introduces, scattered among the thick stanzas of Emerson’s narrative style, poems with staggered lines, uneven spacing, and no recognizable stanzas. In her last volume, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Impossible Bottle </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(LSU Press, 2015), Emerson returns to regular stanza forms, with the exception of poems in the first section, “anatomies,” which use irregular spacing, unrhymed couplets, and no punctuation in that section’s alternating “metastasis poems.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerning stanzas, three temptations exert themselves. One is to ignore the arc of Emerson’s stanzaic forms as nothing more than an accident of the forms deemed appropriate for individual poems or sections. That is certainly possible. The second is to make too much of the progression of Emerson’s poems by analyzing the changing forms in connection with Emerson’s biography, thus falling into the autobiographical trap that hinders thoughtful analysis of her poems. It does not take much imaginative flexibility to consider how the white space, lack of punctuation, and resulting rhythmic jolts and uncertain syntax, especially given their appearance in Emerson’s last volumes, might reflect the poet’s experience of metastasizing cancer. Third, one could suppose that the poet simply wanted to try new forms, got bored with the long narrative structure of the first two volumes and decided to experiment a little. That does not sound like Emerson. There is likely no definitive answer to this minor quandary, but it does seem to be worth a reader’s effort to consider the development of the poet’s stanza style over the arc of her career. There is something there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What, then, more specifically, might be said of the nine, mostly unrhymed, couplets of “Elevator Operator”? There is surely more here than a number of lines equally divisible by two. The couplet form enacts several of the images Emerson uses to connote confinement. They suggest the “strict passage” and “airlessness” of the elevator (3), bounded canals navigated by the gondola (3), bars of the bird cage (7-8), and the “unseen steel cables controlling” their “storied looping” (11-13). The stanza form of this poem affects the reader by engaging her in the repetition and constraint suggested by the content. To go further than this would amount to speculation, but Emerson could not have selected a more appropriate way to support the poem’s images than to lay out these “storied loopings” on the page.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least on one occasion, Emerson described her approach to formal elements of craft as “echoes of form” (interview with author, 2008). This is evident in her occasional use of received forms (the sonnets in Section III of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Late Wife</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) but more importantly in her affinity for rhyme and other musical features. In “Elevator Operator,” the only exact end-rhyme appears in the first stanza, supporting the building sense of confining regularity that permeates the poem. Other end-rhymes come close—“until/dial,” “compass/voice,” “northern/never there”—but the idea of loosening suggested by the slant rhymes is overcome by the poet’s ongoing use of confinement and eclipse imagery until the poem’s end, where both the elevator operator and the Jim Crow south seem to be ignored, their presence and effect now simply assumed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emerson’s focus on music, however, is seldom found in end-rhyme. One usually must look at the internal chiming—rhyme, consonance, and assonance—to see her care with sound made manifest. And as the four sentences of “Elevator Operator” roll across stanza breaks, the reader will see great care taken with syntax and how it is used to reinforce the content of the poem. Emerson ends the poem on a note of despair, or perhaps resignation, as only the last line is formally end-stopped following the description of the elevator operator’s invisibility, even to the children who used to see her, and the south’s abiding, ignored presence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither should Emerson’s attention to rhythm be overlooked. Over the course of her seven volumes, iambic pentameter is her metrical guide star, yet she is never rigid in its use. In “Elevator Operator,” she uses rhythmic variations to great effect. The trochaic hexameter of line 13 reinforces the advance and pause motion of the gondola, of the “storied looping.” The reader feels the content. In lines 14 through 17, trochees battle iambs, but Emerson ends the poem with a firm iambic closure—“as though the south were never there”—following an initial trochaic rhythm (the strong stress on “route” followed by the caesura). Meter reinforces the pessimism of this ending. After the arguing rhythms in the preceding lines—a debate suggesting that roles of race and class might be more fluid that the anecdote might suggest—the poem ends with a settled iambic pentameter line, a comfortable rhythm that corresponds with the normalization of prejudice.     </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of Emerson’s more pronounced talents is with the persona poem. In the most startling examples, the poems of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinion: an elegy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> compose a book-length narrative in which the reader is engaged immediately in the world of Rose, the speaker and “change-of-life baby” whose birth resulted in her mother’s death. In Emerson’s second poem touching on race, “Dr. Crawford Long, Discoverer of the First Surgical Anesthetic, and the Case of Isam Baily” (hereinafter “Dr. Crawford”) from 2015’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Opposite House</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the speaker is no less believable. The poem’s first-person speaker is the physician, not the black juvenile patient. Neither here nor anywhere else in Emerson’s poems will a reader find any ground for charging the poet with cultural appropriation. In this poem, as elsewhere, Emerson treats her characters with dignity. A few are appropriately maligned (see, for example, the gas station owner in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pharaoh, Pharaoh</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s “The Moon is Made”) but even then not vehemently. The condemnations in these rare cases are made all the more effective by the poet’s decision to focus more on the speaker’s pain than the perpetrator’s maliciousness. The tone is not one of acceptance, but there is no vitriol. This tone of resolution, of matter-of-factness, is evident especially in “Dr. Crawford,” and that tone amplifies the horror of the narrative.  </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Opposite House</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Emerson’s penultimate volume, is divided into three sections. The poems in the first section and many of those in the third resemble in their stanza structures the poems in Emerson’s first two volumes. The stanzas are denser and often consist of a single long stanza interrupted by the occasional dropped line. The “early elegies” of the second section are all eight lines long; they offer readers a break from the intensity of other poems in the collection but are not among Emerson’s strongest work. “Dr. Crawford” is the first of four rather macabre poems in the third section of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Opposite House</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The others are “Limb Factory,” “Irene Virga Salafia,” and “The Ocularist.” One cannot read these poems about the body and its study without considering the poet’s deteriorating health at the time the volume was published. To do more than note that relationship, however, would be to indulge in speculation not warranted by the poems themselves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Dr. Crawford” is based on events that occurred in Georgia in 1845, when Dr. Crawford Long continued an experiment with surgical anesthesia previously used in a procedure to remove a tumor from the neck of an adult friend. The doctor’s neighbor brought to him “a boy called Isam, one of her slaves, two fingers / ruined from a burn she had neglected.” The doctor administered the anesthetic and removed one of the child’s two damaged fingers. When the boy recovered from the anesthesia, the patient, according to the speaker, could hardly believe that the amputation had been completed since he had not felt it. In a horrible twist in the narrative, the poet has the doctor amputate the boy’s second damaged finger without anesthesia:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, to demonstrate that he was not</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">merely suggestible to me, I removed</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">the other finger without it. He felt it,</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">of course, as I knew he would—and I found</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">myself working even more quickly to hasten it,</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">though I was accustomed to such displays</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">of pain—and knew his would be brief, that small</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">bone insensible, easy to prune</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">as wisteria at the root. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The narrative continues with the slave owner’s signing a “certificate of witness” to verify the doctor’s account of what had transpired and a commentary on how Isam would tell this story for the remainder of his life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story is unnerving. Emerson reminds readers of prejudices that continue to devalue others’ bodies. Her effectiveness in doing this, however, is as much a matter of the poem’s clinical tone as it is a matter of content. In “Dr. Crawford,” diction is significantly affected by historical period. Emerson’s use of “quail’s egg,” “neighborwoman,” “roused him to the news,” and the capitalized “Mesmerized” helps to set the action in the mid-19</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century, but Emerson chooses other words to create a tone reflecting an acceptance of Isam’s status as less than fully human. When the neighbor brings the injured boy, Dr. Crawford’s attention moves quickly from the unnecessary loss of the boy’s fingers to the woman’s real concern—the loss of the boy’s value resulting from her neglect. Dr. Crawford’s concern with Isam, it is fair to note, is not really about perfecting his surgical method. After all, he had already performed a successful surgery with the anesthetic. No, the doctor saw the circumstance as an act of Providence, an opportunity to enhance his reputation. Emerson gives additional energy to the underlying racism of the anecdote when she describes Crawford’s concern that skeptics might see in the tale only an instance of taking advantage of a witless “simple black child.” The effect is strengthened further by the speaker’s statement of the obvious—that Isam felt the second amputation. The obviousness of the statement suggests that some people hearing the story might not believe the black child would feel pain or at least that his pain would not be much to worry with, much like one might hear about docking the tail of a puppy or a pig: “that small / bone insensible, easy to prune / as wisteria at the root.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not until the poem’s closing lines, however, that Emerson puts tone to its most powerful use. Recalling the speaker’s earlier aside that Isam’s delivery to his care was an act of God, Crawford here reveals the extent both of his hubris and of his sense of mastery, particularly over the enslaved boy:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">                   I suppose it might be compared</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">to the womb—known place and time no one can recall   </span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">and so can never forget, where fingers</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">are knit, webbed to the hand, Isam’s for this;</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">and this was no experiment, but a miracle by design,</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">a proof—like a Lazarus—and I had performed it. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emerson ends the poem with the speaker’s claim to be in a category with Jesus. The surgery is no longer the experiment it was when performed on Crawford’s friend, James Venable. It has now become a miracle, a sign, and Crawford had been selected by God to perform it. Most damning, Crawford suggests that Isam exists for the purpose of proving the physician’s mastery. Isam exists only for Crawford’s glory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before leaving “Dr. Crawford,” the poem’s rhythmic effects should be considered to determine their effect on tone. Although “Elevator Operator” has a narrative element, it can safely be characterized as a lyric. “Dr. Crawford,” although it contains lyric elements, is a narrative poem, and Emerson employs irregular rhythms to reinforce the speaker’s conversational tone. Irregular as they are, some of the lines of the poem submit themselves readily to scansion. See, for example, line 15. Its dactylic opening is followed by a trochee, an anapest, an iamb, and a feminine ending. The lack of metrical regularity and the liberal sprinkling of Latinate words moves the poem toward a prose rhythm that may well strike the reader as the more reliable monologue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like “Dr. Crawford,” the poem which marks Emerson’s last comment on race, “Virginia Christian” (also from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Opposite House)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is based on an historical incident, this one occurring in the early twentieth century. The poet introduces “Virginia Christian” with a note summarizing the basis of the narrative. An African-American maid killed her widow employer after an argument over the employer’s accusation that Christian, 17, had stolen a piece of jewelry. The commonwealth argued that the girl’s physical maturity should be reflected in the sentence, and Virginia Christina in 1912 became the first female electrocuted by the Commonwealth of Virginia. If the poet noticed the irony of the girl’s name and the government’s action, she did not reflect it in the poem’s text.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having outlined the facts in the introductory paragraph, Emerson devotes the poem to particulars: the reaction of the town’s men; the girl’s version of the incident; a description of a photograph taken of Christian at the penitentiary (an interesting word choice—the root suggesting a place for penitents—since “prison” or “jail” might work nearly as well); and a lament that a fate of this sort was predetermined for a girl born in circumstances such as Virginia’s. Emerson is not given to broad political statements, and the same is true in this poem, but that does not mean her poems are devoid of political content. The reader, upon approaching “Virginia Christian” for the first time, may be inclined to consider it solely in terms of race and inequality. She will quickly gather, however, that race in this poem cannot be viewed in isolation from gender. Emerson describes the white men of the town as a lynch mob whose members want to send Christian “to a black man’s / death.” To convince themselves of the justice of this course of action, they talk of her as a man, not as a girl. “They reported her / to have a black man’s / appetite, a black / man’s sleep, / untroubled, sound / as though from some / hard labor.” They convinced themselves that she was something other than she was so that they could unleash their fury upon a more appropriate victim, a black male. Remarkably, the poem refuses to sentimentalize Virginia Christian. By the prisoner’s own account, the girl and the widow each fought with broken broomsticks, and Virginia shoved a towel, the widow’s tongue, and some of the widow’s hair down the older woman’s throat. Assuming no racial prejudice, even if the girl had left the house when the widow was still alive, as she claimed, a murder conviction would have been likely. The poet also does not omit from the account that, after Virginia had subdued the widow Belote, she did take a ring, a purse, and some coins. Emerson even leaves open the possibility that Christian took the locket as the widow originally charged. Yet Emerson probes the particular, beyond the facts of the case, to get at the race and gender underpinnings of this tragedy. Even if matters transpired in a manner that revealed the worst about Christian, the girl</span></p>

</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia Christian” By Claudia Emerson, from THE OPPOSITE HOUSE, copyright © 2015 by Claudia Emerson. Reprinted by permission of Louisiana State University Press.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As noted earlier, “Virginia Christian” is only the second poem in Emerson’s first six volumes that uses the broken, stair-step line. The repetitive downward motion of the line carries with it an air of inevitability that supports the poem’s suggestion that Virginia Christian was born to her fate when born into her black, female body. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The forward pull of the broken lines cannot be ignored, and Emerson adds additional momentum by incorporating alliteration liberally. In the poem’s closing lines excerpted above, readers will both see and feel the repeated “w”s (white, woman’s, widowed, wrath, washing), the “b”s (buried, body, breasts, belly, bed, born, breath), and the assonance of “black,” “wrath,” “strand,” and “casting.” Emerson, of course, is well aware that the pull is nearly overpowering; that is her intent. The best way to read this poem might be simply to succumb to the flow at first and only on subsequent readings look for the handholds that the poet offers as points of reference and orientation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among those points of reference are four finely crafted images. The first, in particular, is powered by Emerson’s characteristically precise diction. Emerson describes the electric chair (and the odd aside that it was “newly made / from a single tree”) and focuses on the straps that would hold Christian in the chair as the current worked through her body, those “stiff leather / harnesses she would / wear.” The image of harness returns in the poem to describe the pooling of the current that will be loosed in the electrocution, but its first mention draws the reader’s mind ineluctably to an animal working a field. The image is not only precise but damning. The effect is supported by a second, subsidiary image, as well. The poet uses the word “scaffold” to describe the chair; the connotation of death by hanging, i.e. lynching, is clear. The third image is one of enclosure. It appears first in the horizon that is closing in at the beginning of the poem but is more jarring when the root “chamber” is used to describe the electrocution room and the locket (the container of an image). The enclosure theme continues as the image changes from a chamber to a grave in the last lines of the poem, climaxing with the final lines’ equation of Christian’s birth and burial: “her first / drawn breath / the casting down / of a fistful of earth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fourth and dominant image in the poem is electricity. It appears first in the opening lines as the gathering lynch mob is described as “a horizon closing in,” a storm cloud forming in the distance. Its next mention is in the description of the electric chair. The image recurs more rapidly in the second half of the poem. The speaker recalls the afternoon of the killing, when Christian was seen buying candy, as a “stunned / reprieve of a spring / afternoon.” This is the way one would describe a quiet interval in an otherwise stormy day. The camera’s flash suggests lightning, and then the electrocution itself is described in advance: “the black glaze / of a sky that was to come / as it always did / with August, the strike / they would harness / for her, send / into her brain a thing / she could not have / imagined, one cloven / tongue enough / to light forever / the house she would never / again see, enough / to light the city.” The last explicit mention of an electrical strike, however, is the most powerful—the metaphor of Christian’s very conception constituting both the first and the fateful strike. This strike set the others in motion, a motion that ultimately could not be resisted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surely approaching Claudia Emerson through poems that avoid the autobiographical bent displayed in her best known and best loved work is an act of evasion. It is possible that delving deeply into those poems, poems that expose readers to the frankness and vulnerability that many of Emerson’s friends and readers have found so attractive and accessible since she first jolted Southern poetry with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pharaoh, Pharaoh</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, will require more distance—more time and less personal familiarity with the poet. So be it. Emerson’s poetic legacy will not depend on her biography. Her “art of sorrow,” as she put it, is “familiar.” Her work will survive, or not, based on the merits of the poems themselves. Those merits do not depend on the poignancy of the poet’s life and death but on the attention she paid to her art.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Writers of fiction have used prisons as settings for centuries, and prison escapes have long been a feature of Hollywood films.  <em>Papillon</em>, <em>The Great Escape</em>, <em>Escape from Alcatraz</em> are just a few, and who hasn&#8217;t seen the rather sentimental <em>Shawshank Redemption </em>or <em>The Green Mile</em>?  In novels, the prison itself is usually one of several locations, and, in films, generally the setting that the characters leave behind.  When inmates don&#8217;t, or can&#8217;t, escape, the prison is the site of an inmate&#8217;s unlikely heroics or redemption.</p>
<p>Novels unfolding primarily in prisons are less common than films, but they tend to provide more realistic, stark details about a prison life.  Almost a sub-genre of crime fiction, prison fiction, particularly by American novelists, uses the physical buildings almost as characters&#8211;and certainly as metaphors for crime and guilt.  But do they reinforce or undermine social norms about crime and punishment?  In these novels, punishment for felonies becomes the penalty every human pays for the sin of participating in human fault&#8211;which we all do.  As crime fiction often shows that any person can become guilty, given the right set of circumstances (read a little Patricia Highsmith or Ian Rankin), prison fiction often shows that the differentiation between being &#8220;inside&#8221; or &#8220;outside&#8221; is less distinct than we may believe.</p>
<p>One of the best-known novels in which the prison itself is an integral part of the characterization is the classic <em>Cool Hand Luke</em>. Written by Donn Pearce and first published in 1965, this novel is purportedly about a petty thief who gets convicted after cutting the heads from parking meters.  In the movie, Paul Newman&#8217;s good looks keep the focus on Luke, but in the novel the characters all become secondary to the prison itself.  They don&#8217;t even have names; instead, they are all given nicknames&#8211;Dragline, Stupid Blondie, Dynamite, Gator.  Even Luke&#8217;s name isn&#8217;t Luke; it&#8217;s Lloyd Johnson.  The convicts acquire their prison names through some metaphor or habit. Dragline, for example, is out working, and the Captain asks &#8220;Boss Godfrey&#8221; how he is doing.  &#8220;Ain&#8217;t never seen nothin&#8217; like it, Cap&#8217;n.  He can shovel more mud than any six men put together.  He&#8217;s like a human dragline&#8221; (38).  And so his name becomes Dragline.  As the narrator says, however, &#8220;But once upon a time, his name was Clarence Slidell.&#8221;</p>
<p>This fairy-tale diction suggests the other-worldly quality of what is called the &#8220;Free World&#8221; in this novel.  Their &#8220;real&#8221; world is the prison and the chain gang.  It&#8217;s a white, male world, though they see a few women and people of color as they work and ride in the truck, and Luke&#8217;s final scene takes place in an African American church.  The convicts refer to themselves as &#8220;The Family&#8221; and &#8220;The Hard Road,&#8221; which they consider &#8220;a noun and . . .a proper name, capitalized and sacred&#8221; (6).  And the prison itself is &#8220;the Building,&#8221; also always capitalized.  The walls of the Building, along with its surrogates, &#8220;the Box&#8221; (a small cell for punishment) and &#8220;the cage truck.&#8221;  Despite allowing brief glimpses of the Free World, of cars and women, the truck remains their &#8220;caged world on wheels&#8221; (3).</p>
<p>The Building and the cage truck contain and control the convicts and are barely less human than the guards, who treat the convicts with inhuman rigidity:  &#8220;There is no privacy whatever in the Building.  Just as there are no wash basins nor cups.  You drink, wash, shave and brush your teeth beneath the one faucet in the shower stall&#8221; (60).  An &#8220;armed guard sits up all night keeping watch,&#8221; and it seems as though the Building itself is watching them through its windows that are &#8220;square holes without any glass, covered over with chain link fence material and also with fly screen.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Luke, with &#8220;that smile&#8221; (68) and lack of concern for following the rules of the &#8220;Fatherland&#8221; (83), becomes legendary, a &#8220;song&#8221; and a &#8220;story&#8221; (41), though by the time the novel opens, he is already dead.  Retelling the details of Luke&#8217;s escapes, his exploits when captured and recaptured, his insistence on playing it &#8220;cool&#8221; (hence his nickname) sustain the prisoners&#8217; hopes that they, too, will escape the deadening, meaningless monotony of their lives.  In fact, though, Luke&#8217;s story reinforces the similarity between the Building and the Free World.</p>
<p>One of the features of Luke&#8217;s past that the narrator mentions frequently without comment is his service in World War II.  The war looms large and seems to have had quite a lot to do with Luke&#8217;s criminal activity&#8211;and perhaps with the other convicts&#8217; as well.  They first see Luke in the paper, in two photos:  &#8220;the one a formal military portrait, the kind we all sent home during the war . . .the other the picture of a drunk peering through the bars&#8221; (44).  When Luke commits his crime, he sees the parking meters as soldiers, &#8220;advancing, marching forward in open ranks, a battalion of emaciated soldiers with ugly faces beneath odd-shaped foreign helmets&#8221; (47).  The word &#8220;VIOLATION&#8221; on the meters sends Luke into a mental tailspin: &#8220;Had he done a violation?  Did he dare make a violation?  Had a violation been committed against him? . . . Is a violation done to you&#8211;are they made&#8211;or do you commit them?&#8221; (47).</p>
<p>This uncertainty bleeds into the prison itself.  When Luke is incarcerated at Raiford, he (like the narrator before him) rides past the &#8220;Visitor&#8217;s Park,&#8221; where a band is playing &#8220;a rousing military march&#8221; (57).  The second prison is a &#8220;Camp,&#8221; and its highest figure of authority is a &#8220;Captain&#8221; (59).  After Luke gets his banjo back from his brother, he slowly retells his experiences during the war.  He and his fellow soldiers robbed, raped, and killed innocent civilians.  They acted indiscriminately.  Sometimes &#8220;prisoners were fed.&#8221;  Other times, &#8220;prisoners were shot.&#8221;  Local girls &#8220;were given chocolate bars.&#8221;  Or they &#8220;were raped&#8221; (158).  Luke&#8217;s war became &#8220;an orgy of vandalism&#8221; until he was confronted in a room where he has gone to attack a girl with &#8220;a huge crucifix, the figure of Christ . . . .Luke stood there and looked at it.  He looked down at the girl.  He waited for a long time, hanging his head and thinking and quietly slung his banjo over his shoulder and left the room&#8221; (159).</p>
<p>This incident seems to have driven Luke into an agony of non-belief.  He taunts God when a lightning storm threatens the chain gang, asking Him to &#8220;show your stuff, Old Timer!  Make me know it!  Make me know you&#8217;re up there!&#8221; (174).  But Luke fails to get an answer&#8211;or a lightning bolt.  No matter how Luke tries to provoke the Almighty, terrifying the other convicts, his answers come only from the prison system.  Luke is shot in the church by lawmen, &#8220;his hands . . .still raised&#8221; in an almost cruciform position.  And in the retelling, Sailor notes that the universe is controlled by guards.  The worst of these, &#8220;the Walking Boss,&#8221; becomes almost godlike, as the narrator, speaking collectively for the entire &#8220;Family&#8221; reveals:  &#8220;we knew that sun was really the left eye of the Walking Boss just as his right eye is the moon&#8221; (77).  Later, when Luke escapes, Boss Godfrey shows his &#8220;outraged moon-eye&#8221; (242).  And the guards are just one link in the hierarchical chain that binds the convicts:  &#8220;in the complex hierarchy of the Chain Gang every boss has another boss, the purely eternal rising on high right up through the Captain and even beyond until it ultimately reaches the Great White Father himself, who reigns supreme in Tallahassee&#8221; (188).  So it comes as no surprise that the fury over Luke&#8217;s escapes manifests itself in the eyes of the Walking Boss, which become &#8220;two balls of blinding celestial fire&#8221; (254).</p>
<p>Luke cannot escape, and neither can anyone else.  After Luke&#8217;s death, the  Building itself puts out &#8220;subtle vibrations&#8221; in response to the steps of the Floorwalker, who is, like everyone else, &#8220;wearing away his Time&#8221; (298).  The memory of Luke becomes the only hymn they sing, because he dared to &#8220;do it the hard way and make history by escaping from the Building itself&#8221; (197).  But as Luke tells them all, to escape the Building can only mean death, because &#8220;It&#8217;s a hard world out there&#8221; (259).  He makes clear to them &#8220;quite calmly&#8221; (and to readers as well) that, in contrast to the convicts&#8217; belief that the Free World is essentially different from theirs,  &#8220;there was really no other world but this&#8221; (260).</p>
<p>A close contemporary of <em>Cool Hand Luke </em>(though less well-known), Patricia Highsmith&#8217;s <em>The Glass Cell</em> (1964) features the unjustly imprisoned Philip Carter, who has been convicted of embezzling company funds.  Highsmith  usually endows her criminals and villains with charm and intelligence&#8211;and she often allows them to escape detection&#8211;so this is an unusual novel in her body of work.  Carter is self-doubting, mild, and devoted to his unfaithful wife, at least for a while.</p>
<p>Like <em>Cool Hand Luke</em>, <em>The Glass Cell </em>begins in the prison, but Highsmith&#8217;s setting is fully integrated racially, and she makes it clear that sexual encounters among inmates are not uncommon.  She also sees her main character, Carter, all the way through his sentence and devotes the second half of the novel to his post-prison life.</p>
<p>Carter could not be more different from Luke, at least initially.  He becomes frustrated when he gets &#8220;demerits&#8221; because &#8220;he did not yet know everything he could and could not do&#8221; (14), especially since &#8220;there was no list of regulations anywhere that an inmate could read and so avoid committing misdemeanors&#8221; (15).  As a result of a minor infraction of the rules, Carter is put into &#8220;the Hole&#8221; (roughly equivalent to &#8220;the Box&#8221; in <em>Cool Hand Luke</em>) and strung up by his thumbs.  The torture, as well as the pleasure that the guards seem to derive from inflicting it, causes Carter to view the prison as a madhouse.  The prison doctor&#8217;s attitude only reinforces this: &#8220;Dr. Cassini had a cheerful, matter-of-fact way of talking about the Hole, and victims of it whom he had treated, that gave Carter an eerie feeling that he was in a madhouse instead of a prison a madhouse in which the caretakers were the madmen, as in the old cliché&#8221; (24).</p>
<p>Madness, for Carter, suggests a chaotic state of mind, in contrast to the orderly rules and regulations he seeks.  After his thumbs are ruined beyond repair, he lies in the infirmary wondering &#8220;Who was mad? . . . Which ones of them?&#8221;  He seems to be referring to the other inmates, but in fact his thoughts move on to the legal system:  &#8220;Which jurors and which judges out of the thousands who had sent these six thousand men here?&#8221; (26).  As his faith in rules dissolves (even Dr. Cassini tells him, &#8220;You try to fight city hall and you go crazy&#8221; 27), Carter conflates the law and prison life.  When his wife comes to comfort him about the appeals process (ironically being sought by the man with whom she is having an affair), he becomes complacent: &#8220;The law.  Where is it?  What good is it?&#8221; (34).  Indeed, the law has abandoned Carter, who was set up by others in his firm to look guilty, when in fact he has only been guilty of a tendency to &#8220;carelessness&#8221; (46).</p>
<p>What is Carter&#8217;s response to this injustice?  He becomes &#8220;cool,&#8221; like Luke; he has &#8220;to have hope, and at the same time not take things too seriously&#8221; (60).  And like Luke, he realizes that he must &#8220;arrive at a &#8216;right attitude&#8217; or else&#8221; (60).  He learns that the prison system is rigged against him&#8211;and against other prisoners&#8211;to allow authorities like the doctor to ignore illness and corruption, and so when another inmate dies after neglect, and Carter discovers the body under a sheet, it is &#8220;like unveiling a crime&#8221; (63).  And &#8220;thus the years rolled on&#8221; (101) while murders during a riot seem &#8220;right and proper&#8221; (109) and Carter makes &#8220;an effort to see things differently&#8221; (110).</p>
<p>One of the significant features of Highsmith&#8217;s novel is that Carter is released, having served his full sentence, halfway through the story.  He goes home to his wife and son, and despite the continuing problem of having had his thumbs mangled by prison guards manages to secure a job.  All seems well.  But he discovers then that his suspicions about his wife&#8217;s fidelity are true&#8211;she has been having an affair with a family friend for years&#8211;and that his son considers the lover more of a father than Carter.  He is addicted to morphine and misses Max, the one friend he had inside.  Max is long dead, but he seems &#8220;more alive and real than any of the rest of them&#8221; (134).</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Carter comes to the conclusion that &#8220;the whole world is like one big prison, and prisons are just an exaggerated form of it&#8221; (143).  The title of the book then comes into focus:  a &#8220;glass cell&#8221; may have invisible walls, but it&#8217;s a cell just the same.  When events lead to Carter committing what actually is a crime, and then another, he does so without remorse.  Even the police, when questioning him, remark, &#8220;&#8216;Ain&#8217;t he a cool one'&#8221; (203).  And he is&#8211;so cool, in fact that he has &#8220;no pangs of conscience&#8221; (214) about anything.  When the police look as though they&#8217;re closing in on him, Carter imagines his position as &#8220;a difficult spot&#8221; which he can escape if he remains &#8220;cool.  Very, very cool, just idealess&#8221; (222).  He removes his tie so that his shirt is &#8220;more like a prison shirt&#8221; (246).  Unlike Luke, who cannot stop himself from dreaming of a better life, Carter accepts that the world is a &#8220;glass cell.&#8221;  Unknowable rules govern everyone, and anyone can come  under surveillance.  This knowledge allows him to survive, even to thrive, and when the police threaten never to stop &#8220;watching&#8221; him, Carter can say, with what sounds like relatively good humor, &#8220;I know&#8221; (249).</p>
<p>Ben Greer&#8217;s <em>Slammer</em>, first published in 1975 and reissued by LSU Press in 2002, marks a decidedly grim turn in the prison novel.  Unleavened by the wit and intermittent humor of <em>Cool Hand Luke </em>and <em>The Glass Cell</em>, this short book seems hardly aware of the outside world at all, and though the violence of the earlier books was certainly detailed, the despair and brutality in <em>Slammer</em> are unrelenting.</p>
<p>While all of the other novels under consideration here center, at least largely, on one character, Greer provides an ensemble cast of guards and prisoners, all of whom have become so deeply enmeshed in the prison culture that it&#8217;s impossible to see a way out.  The story begins with Aaron Walsh, a new guard, entering the prison through &#8220;Carter&#8217;s gate&#8221; which was named &#8220;for a guard who had been stabbed to death there some years ago.&#8221;   Although the &#8220;large sign&#8221; hanging above the last set of stairs reads &#8220;&#8216;Prison Is a Highway Not a Dead End'&#8221; (5), incarceration does in fact become that dead end&#8211;literally for some.</p>
<p>The guards, most of whom are impaired by &#8220;a shot or two just before they came in&#8221; or &#8220;uppers and downers&#8221; that they take &#8220;through the long day&#8221; (9), extort money and favors from the prisoners, and Walsh is assured that &#8220;&#8216;Cons don&#8217;t trust men who aren&#8217;t on the take.  Neither do guards'&#8221;(49).  The priest, a recovering alcoholic, despises his new assistant, whose &#8220;fingers were slim and dark and even the nails perfectly rounded and without flaw&#8221; (43).  The prisoners rape and attack each other, seemingly at will, and the race hatred among them has divided them into rival gangs, each bent on controlling the prison.  James Moultrie, a new convict, believes that the &#8220;whites had put him here because he tried to help his brothers&#8221; by calling his actions &#8220;armed robbery&#8221; (31); his rival is &#8220;the Muslim,&#8221; whom Moultrie considers &#8220;nothing more than silk and Beethoven, a perfumed cancer that ate up his brothers&#8221; (54).  On only one point do Moultrie and &#8220;the Muslim&#8221; agree:  &#8220;&#8216;The whites are our trouble.  They are bright wolves, but they will fade'&#8221; (56).</p>
<p>Nothing in <em>Slammer</em> operates as it should.  The prisoners are better-armed than the guards.  While the guards carry unloaded weapons, the prisoners carry &#8220;prison-made knives&#8221; and Walsh is told that if he ever &#8220;feel[s] a shiv on a man&#8221; during a search, he should &#8220;let him go&#8221;:  &#8220;Give him a hard one-eye.  Write a report.  When we had clubs, it was different.  We had a chance.  But now&#8211;we just write a report&#8221; (94).  One inmate, John Darcy, is called &#8220;the angel of Death&#8221; and carries, along with an alarming body odor from an untreated cancerous growth, an ice pick with which he kills by stabbing people through the ear.  Another prisoner has had two of his sons &#8220;commit minor offenses&#8221; so that they can join him in making whiskey and selling it inside.  It&#8217;s &#8220;like the service,&#8221; he says (157).  The two priests, who might have acted as moral centers for the prison community, end up in a boxing ring, bloodying each other.  Someone shouts, &#8220;&#8216;Good God!&#8217; (123) when the battered clergymen are discovered, but no benevolent deity is evident in this novel.</p>
<p>In such a place, where race hatred and personal gang warfare dominate, mass violence is predictable&#8211;and when Moultrie has &#8220;the Muslim&#8221; murdered and then incites a riot&#8211;it becomes inevitable.  And even that is bungled.  A guard is accidentally killed, and his colleagues, armed by the Governor when the prisoners will not lay down their own weapons,  accidentally shoot one of the priests.  Several hostages are murdered.  The guard, whose appearance at the prison opens the novel, can&#8217;t take the shot to kill Moultrie, and it costs two more hostages their lives.</p>
<p>Nothing is really resolved, and nothing really changes.  <em>Slammer </em>ends as bleakly as it begins, and its lack of humor, of dreams, and of respite from violence set it apart from the other novels here in many ways.  Most of the references to an outside world mark a sharp difference between freedom and imprisonment.  And yet that difference is blurred by the larger arcs of the various intertwined stories.  &#8220;Rose,&#8221; one of the retired &#8220;whores,&#8221; tells a young inmate who is turning tricks to stay alive, &#8220;&#8216;Here you cannot choose.  Outside you dare not'&#8221; (198).  The older priest considers his appointment to the prison &#8220;<em>a life sentence</em>&#8221; (137) and equates offerings with robbery: &#8220;&#8216;I make a heist every Sunday in broad daylight'&#8221; (139).  And when the guard fails to kill the riot leader, he agrees with his colleague&#8217;s assessment about his future:  &#8220;&#8216;On the roof, you got into debt.  Where else can you go&#8221; (254).  Everyone, the novel suggests, is one error away from punishable guilt.</p>
<p>Joseph Bathanti&#8217;s <em>Coventry</em>, published in 1975, moves the focus of the prison novel to the guards and so provides a balance to the majority of prison novels, which focus largely on prisoners.  The main character, Calvin Gaddy, has followed his father&#8217;s lead in working for the prison system, and the entire novel makes the separation between guard and prisoner murky and tangled.  This book strives very hard&#8211;a little too hard sometimes&#8211;for the poetic in its imagery and language, and its primary register is spiritual (often biblical).  Cal&#8217;s father, Mac, is haunted by the ghosts of the men he has guarded and becomes increasingly maddened by their presence.  Cal himself is haunted by the seemingly mystical knowledge that the baby his wife Rachel is carrying is male (despite ultrasounds which have indicated that it is female) and will continue the Gaddy legacy of prison work.  Grisly scenes are suddenly revealed to be nightmares; prisoners bewitch guards; the guards deal in illegal drugs with the prisoners; Cal himself becomes enmeshed in buying and using both drugs and alcohol on the job.  Incarcerated men may be saints, and the prison officials may be devils.  This is a nasty world, deeply rooted in the Civil War, and though the point of view is primarily Cal&#8217;s, the characters are all prisoners in the closed system of Coventry.</p>
<p>Mac has been a hard task-master in his time, and he repeatedly reminds Cal that the difference between a guard and an inmate is stark.  He is relentless in his pursuit of escapees and will stop at nothing to recapture one:  &#8220;MacGregor Gaddy would throw rocks.  He hit a convict with a dog once, beat another with a live black snake.  He&#8217;d run him down with the truck, throw himself on him from the speeding vehicle.  Pound him with his fists, with a coffee pot, never saying a word.  Few of them tested him, but came on out, solemn as church, and surrendered at the sight of him&#8221; (12).  He tells Cal that the separation of right and wrong is unassailable: &#8220;you are right because you carry the keys, and he is wrong because he wears the stripes. You go messing with the order of that in jail and you might as well peel off your britches and bend over&#8221; (240).</p>
<p><em> </em>Cal accepts the truth of what his father tells him, at least consciously.  He has, after all, become a guard as his father was, and eventually makes sergeant.  He, however, is &#8220;not the same sort as his father.  He did not really believe in prison, nor own the proper temperament&#8221; (12).  Cal, like Cool Hand Luke and Philip Carter, needs to get his mind right, but he can&#8217;t&#8211;and the justice system, including his own father, seems to be telling him that he doesn&#8217;t need to, because he&#8217;s a guard.</p>
<p>This novel, however, suggests that the wisdom of the system simply isn&#8217;t true.  Guards are like convicts, and the convicts include both the saintly Frank and the demonic Pitch.  Cal, high as he often is on marijuana, feels among the prisoners &#8220;a familiarity which was both comforting and disorienting&#8221; and finds himself &#8220;lost . . .among them&#8221; (17).  When he goes home, he must pass his father&#8217;s house, which is falling apart but illuminated by &#8220;spotlights&#8221; (32), like the prison itself.  The prisoners watch prison shows on TV, and old Mac Gaddy still wears &#8220;a brown state conflict shirt&#8221; (36).  Cal soon begins to &#8220;identify&#8221; his unborn child with an executed convict (111), and when another guard insists that the drugs are being sold by &#8220;one of them&#8221; (113), Cal immediately thinks, &#8220;One of us&#8221; (114).</p>
<p>Much of the world of <em>Coventry</em> may seem implausibly mystical&#8211;conjurings; dreams that leave physical injuries on the dreamers; ghostly apparitions on walls after a prison fire; the many memories of Cal&#8217;s lunatic mother, struck dead by lightning on her own threshold; the sudden personification of the prison cook shack&#8211;but the blending of good and evil, of prison and &#8220;free world,&#8221; are perfectly believable.  Cal knows that he has &#8220;made the crossover&#8221; to criminal, but he also realizes that this &#8220;stepping over&#8221; has made him stronger as a new sergeant (133).  It also makes him more responsible when the cook shack burns and kills a number of inmates, as well as one of the guards.</p>
<p>Cal is at home, asleep, when the fire starts, but as a senior officer he must shoulder much of the burden of explanation.  This proves easy enough to do, when his father tells him to &#8220;will&#8221; himself into the right.  Cal &#8220;turn[s] this over a time or two in his head&#8221; and finds that he can do it&#8211;will himself into believing that preserving himself at whatever cost is &#8220;right.&#8221;  He decides that he will &#8220;live with it&#8221; if he must lie: &#8220;He would live with it until it became his truth, and then it would no longer be a lie.  Like the prison itself&#8221; (240).  He can become brutal and violent, tearing the beard from a man&#8217;s face, and his victim sees that he has been &#8220;out convicted by a free man&#8221; (246).</p>
<p>But Cal is not free, nor is anyone else in this novel.  At the end, the novel seems to accept, even to embrace, its premise that the world is a prison.  The baby is a boy, as Cal somehow knew, and is named Eli, after Cal&#8217;s dead mother Elizabeth.  The infant, somehow infected with the ghostly world of the prison, has a preternatural ability to understand the adults around him.  He can see his dead grandmother; he can see the dead convicts.  He even plays with one of them, and their games make &#8220;the tiny boy laugh and laugh&#8221; (260-261).  He embodies the likeness of prison and free world, and he is &#8220;not afraid,&#8221; because his grandfather has built &#8220;a wall . . .to protect him&#8221; (261).</p>
<p><em> `</em>The world of prison life continues to intrigue readers and viewers.  Television shows like <em>Orange Is the New Black</em> and <em>Women in Prison</em> now focus on female prisoners, both fictional and real, and the endless number of reality shows about law enforcement officers indicates that the appetite for seeing what happens to offenders has not slackened.  TV tends, however, either to glamorize or to downplay the grim details of prison life.  In these novels, there are no superheroes, or even sympathetic parole boards or guards, to mitigate the dehumanizing grind of incarceration.  But what is more striking in them all is the suggestion that we are all, at best, one misstep or mistake, one unrealizable ideal or one moment of madness, away from a cell.  In fact, we may all be in cells that we cannot&#8211;or will not&#8211;see.</p>
