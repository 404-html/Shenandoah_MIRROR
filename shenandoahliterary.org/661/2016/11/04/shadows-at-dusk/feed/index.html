					<description><![CDATA[This piece is hilarious! I love how ludicrous the situation is, and how the competitiveness of these two men is enough to keep them glued to their seats. The aimless gondola floating through the square was just the cherry on top. The absurdity of it all reminded me very much of many short stories written by the likes of Roald Dahl. A wonderful story indeed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Laurel. My wife and I visited Venice, Florence, and Rome on a Rick Steves tour a couple of years ago, and I wrote a flash set in each city to commemorate the trip. I liked Venice the most and would move there tomorrow if I could afford it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a humorous and intriguing story! The characters are so vivid and the dialogue is captivating and real. The competitive aspect of their friendship adds enough tension to ground the absurd scene.The slow deluge creates a mounting sense of suspense that spills into the conclusion. Thank you for such a delightful example of flash fiction.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I thoroughly enjoyed this piece. Pauly and Cass are easily pictured in my mind as I read through this story, their bantering mannerisms so familiar and well depicted. The story switches between the chess game and water situation seamlessly, making the matter of their predicament all the funnier. The author is able, in an efficient manner, to show friendship, stubbornness, loyalty, and competitiveness all in one piece.]]></description>
