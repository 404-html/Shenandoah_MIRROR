					<description><![CDATA[A raw exploration of grief and anger told in a direct but sympathetic manner. The dichotomy of the sisters highlights Denise&#039;s anger while the inner monologues show the all-encompassing effect of grief. The descriptions are just strange enough to grab my attention while also perfectly portraying the situation. The character development is magnificent, making readers side with Denise even at her lowest point.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Holly Hunt does an incredible job with a 12-year-old girl&#039;s grieving diction, while still using the third person narrative to incorporate the inner dialogue of the father, younger sister and (absence of) the mother. I especially like the allegory of the tiny rocks that Denise places in her socks that find a use later, representing the process of her grief after the abandonment of her mother. As Zan Jarvis said above, &quot;Looking at the genesis of someone else&#039;s pain makes me consider the origins of my own.&quot; This digs deep inside me, searching for my own child within.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a beautiful tale of fierce anger at abandonment. The dream death shows so clearly how our brains sift and recombine the worst to make emotional justice for our hearts. It&#039;s so true it seems almost documentary. I love it that the mad child loses all sympathy for her family who suffers with her. It shows how defended she needs to be in her new circumstances. We all harbor justifiable grudges. They are the deepest wounds, the ones that hurt us the longest, and the ones that are most difficult to unseat.  Looking at the genesis of someone else&#039;s pain makes me consider the origins of my own. That&#039;s the magic of a story. This one&#039;s magical.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This piece is full of interesting and unique descriptions, my favorite being &quot;flee like a reptile that quickly forgets her eggs.&quot; The change in diction and writing style part way through matches the change that is seen in Denise, a quick turn I wasn&#039;t expecting, which kept me engaged and excited to see what was coming next. This characters in this piece and their situation are relatable, making the struggles that Denise faces understandable, and I found myself being sympathetic towards her despite her angry actions.]]></description>
