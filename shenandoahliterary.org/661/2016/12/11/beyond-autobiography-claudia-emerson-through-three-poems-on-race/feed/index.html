					<description><![CDATA[Wow. This is a masterful close reading of a selection of Claudia Emerson&#039;s poems. I have never read work by her and I think that if I had, I would have missed out on its craft without Philip Belcher&#039;s analysis and commentary. When I read &quot;Elevator Operator,&quot; I did not even pick up on the subject of the poem - the black woman who operates the elevator, who is a stark contrast to the white female shoppers that she transports. It reflects the whole point of her invisibility, which makes me wonder if I am that affected by my own white, privileged blindness, or if I was just manipulated by Emerson, to reflect that all along. 

The broken, stair-step line structure of &quot;Virginia Christian&quot; is interesting because I&#039;ve always had a problem truly deciphering it. But Belcher clears all that up by interpreting it as a a representation of the carried motion of the events, beyond the control of Christian because of who she is. Belcher&#039;s reading of the characterization of the poem&#039;s subject is refreshing: &quot;She will quickly gather, however, that race in this poem cannot be viewed in isolation from gender.&quot; Intersectionality of identity is something we study in my Women&#039;s, Gender and Sexuality Studies and I love when I see academic and literary crossovers (which I think is a goal of Belcher&#039;s piece here).

I definitely want to read more Emerson because of this and Belcher has started a seed in me for truly getting at her meaning.]]></description>
