								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/661/2016/12/27/hillbilly-elegy-a-memoir-of-a-family-and-a-culture-by-j-d-vance-harper-2016/hillbilly/" rel="attachment wp-att-273"><img class="alignleft wp-image-273" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/661/files/2016/12/hillbilly-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" /></a>Perhaps in part because I live at the foot of the Appalachians and occasionally teach the region’s literature, I was eager to read J. D. Vance’s best-selling <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em>.  And I’ll admit that my enthusiasm was amplified by Vance’s appearances on CNN political shows, where he was enlisted, effectively, as an expert on the frustration, anger and near-hopelessness of the divested and marginalized natives of the Appalachian highlands and their kin who have moved to the Midwest in search of employment and dignity.  I was, however, disappointed with the book, and by the time I reached the last chapters, I realized that the disappointment was to some degree my fault.</p>
<p>The subtitle of the book is <em>A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis</em>, but the gap between my expectations and the reality of the book is the result of the main title.  “Hillbilly Elegy<em>”</em> is an inviting phrase, because the two words are born of such different diction and their pairing implies a willingness to forego the euphemisms about superficial identity of Appalachians and avoid the distraction of linguistic niceties.  “Hillbilly” suggests candor and transgression; “elegy” suggests both erudition and lamentation for the loss of something precious, perhaps even beyond prosperity.  I expected a book exploring a culture and its identity crises, but Vance’s book is really a more personal memoir, which succeeds in portraying his early navigation through a family beset with the habits and attitudes that currently assail the poor and uneducated highlanders who migrate when mining plays out in their region.  But its focus is, for about three-quarters of the book, much narrower, as if the larger picture of Appalachian culture and history can be adequately represented by one clan’s difficulties, awful and pitiable as they are.</p>
<p>In that focal capacity, the personal story is effective and alarming.  The drug addiction, violence, premature procreation, dearth of hope and widespread of denial all play a role in the defeat of every family member less disciplined, intelligent and lucky than the author.  Along his path from Jackson, Kentucky (and Middletown, Ohio) to the Marine Corps, Yale Law and on to Silicon Valley, Vance reveals a rogue’s gallery of people he calls “hillbillies,” evidently intending to show that he pulls no punches and toes no politically correct line.  I suspect the true driving force behind the book is a desire to explore and perhaps explain how he can love his people while detesting most of their actions and beliefs.</p>
<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/661/2016/12/27/hillbilly-elegy-a-memoir-of-a-family-and-a-culture-by-j-d-vance-harper-2016/j-d-vance/" rel="attachment wp-att-274"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-274" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/661/files/2016/12/J-D-Vance-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>Unfortunately, his decision to shoot from the hip does not protect him from clichés of situation and language, generalities and digressions.  One acute longing I felt reading this book was to experience the sensory vigor of a life attentively lived, for arrestingly acute observations and provocative contrasts.  And to be fair, Vance is handy with the demographics and predictable conflicts, while he occasionally turns a pithy anecdote certifying his family’s routine dysfunction and occasional sacrifice.  Unfortunately (and he readily admits this) the story he tells is not limited to mountain people and not very different from the adversity that besets urban African Americans.  He also mentions, but only briefly, that there is Appalachian life beyond the pattern his family follows.</p>
<p>Even more greedy, I also wanted to hear the sound of genuine Appalachian dialogue, those neologisms and transgressive figures of speech that approach poetry (like &#8220;nar a steam to go around” or “wallop my dodger, if you please”), instead of being told that mountain people have a saying – “too big for his britches” – a phrase long ensconced in the mainstream of American slang.  I most wanted to see how problems &#8212; like the proclaimed respect for hard work he records from those who exhaust their ingenuity avoiding it – are exacerbated and given mythic status in the midst of a contrarian culture which inspires both scorn and admiration.</p>
<p>So Vance’s title, and his TV persona, gave me an appetite for a book which he was not on a mission to write.  My error.  Truth is, when a book says “memoir” on the  cover, I’m inclined to spring in the other direction.  But I took a chance, figuring that one who loved literature as much as Vance says he does would be familiar with the word work of everyone from Lee Smith (say <em>Saving Grace</em>) to Ron Rash (perhaps <em>The World Made Straight</em>), Charles Frazier to Charles Wright, Wendell Berry and Harriet Arnow.  In short, I wanted to hear about the evolution, amid economically-driven diaspora, of those features of mountain life which invited and nourished the famous hillbilly pride – the music and storytelling, the resourcefulness (right down to but not emphasizing moonshining), the timbering legacy, hunting, mining, union life, ecology, animal husbandry, agriculture, medicine, humor, matters ethnographic, demographic and linguistic.  These are not subjects I wanted instead of the recent history of the Blanton-Vance story – ending in the high cotton of law school, beautiful wife, affluence – but rather broader matters which I wanted to see the Blanton-Vances negotiating.  I wanted the larger historical, spiritual, aesthetic context, and though the author touches briefly on religion, he seems unengaged with even the various robust kinds of faith that still both staunch and hobble Appalachians today.  In short, Appalachian culture extends far beyond his topical and personal use of the term, and even when his family didn’t practice many Appalachian virtues, they may have been living in the midst of them.</p>
<p>The rogue but loving grandmother with a foul mouth and an aptitude for firearms seems important to the tale, and she gets more backstory than most, but mountain music, dancing, instrument making, highland craft, generosity and suspicion all deserve to play a larger role and set the stage for Vance’s Horatio Alger chronicle.  What would have gone a long way toward satisfying me?  The author seems to feel that very few sources other than family memory and economic analyses would help a reader understand why one particular region was the perfect (and ironic) locale for his pilgrim’s progress.  I wish he had spent a few hours with the U. of Tennessee Press’s <em>Encyclopedia of Appalachia</em>, some time reading creative works like those of Robert Morgan, Denise Giardina, Anne and Breece Pancake, Chris Offutt.  A journey through the photographic albums of Shelby Lee Adams would have provided valuable touchstones, and some hours listening to Doc Watson and Dock Boggs, Earl Scruggs and Vassar Clements, Ralph Stanley and Jean Richie.  The hymns and murder ballads, the Jack tales and rusties.  I suppose I wanted to see how his story and those which it parallels exists in relation to the Foxfire books, the early research of Horace Kephart, Williams’ <em>Appalachia: A History</em>, Drake’s <em>A History of Appalachia</em>, or Tom Burton’s lively books about folk customs and religious practices.  In short, the story Vance tells loses force when isolated (or nearly so) from the truth and falsity of common notions concerning “the hillbilly.”  While there is no substitute for personal experience and word of mouth, he might have cast a wider net for a richer catch.</p>
<p>I hope it’s clear what I’m suggesting here: you can’t get a good grip on Appalachian Culture and the people who are genuinely enmeshed in it unless you address Appalachian folk culture, which is soil and seed and weather from which contemporary migrant Appalachians have sprung.  Their journey from the hills to the cities may be an alternative to what Weston la Barre calls a “crisis cult” in <em>They Shall Take Up Serpents</em>, his landmark study of serpent handling believers.  How much richer this story might have been against the backdrop of  the Carters, Hazel Dickens, courting dulcimers and beekeeping, mountain heroes from the Skillet Lickers to those who follow “The Sacred Harp.”  Acuff  and lumbering, hunting and Tommy Jarrell, railroading, the cultivation and employment of ginseng and other herbs.</p>
<p>When I think of Hillbillies (rabbit twisters, stump jumpers – mountain dialect is full of synonyms), I think of resourceful and sometimes desperate people who suffer the deprivations and inspirations of living on the margins.  In this memoir we see plenty of what they have to be ashamed of, but the balancing measure in their equation would involve the indigenous acts and beliefs they are proud of.  The interplay between these and how the narrator of the book paddles upstream in this rough current would have taken longer to write and hunger for a wider vision.  It would probably be less timely and topical, though perhaps just as political, but it’s not a volume destined for the best seller list, though I hope Vance will try his hand at it anyway.</p>
<p>I’d like to imagine Vance spending an evening tapping his feet to Vassar Clements’ fiddle (&#8220;Orange Blossom Special,&#8221; for starters), an afternoon gawking and arguing at Ferrum College’s fall Folklife Festival, a weekend with<em> Cold Mountain</em> and <em>Saving Grace</em>.  None of his discoveries would be likely to crowd out what he has already recorded, but the result might be more lament than complaint, and here’s hoping that, though “misery” may belong in the title, perhaps he will find that “elegy” is a touch premature.<a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/661/2016/12/27/hillbilly-elegy-a-memoir-of-a-family-and-a-culture-by-j-d-vance-harper-2016/fid/" rel="attachment wp-att-280"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-280" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/661/files/2016/12/fid-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/661/2016/12/23/263/allegheny/" rel="attachment wp-att-264"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-264" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/661/files/2016/12/allegheny-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>Matthew Neill Null, recipient of the Joseph Brodsky Rome Prize, among other accolades, follows up his novel <em>Honey from the Lion </em>(2015) with a collection of short stories entitled <em>Allegheny Front </em>(2016)<em>. </em>Though his time is now split between Provincetown, Massachusetts and his native home of West Virginia, there is no question which location had its influence on the collection of stories. The mountain heritage and unique regional characteristics are vividly painted throughout each story and his expertise is never in question. Null’s use of native jargon and region-specific activities of hunting, fishing and rafting immerses the reader in the lifestyle of the natives through stories depicting rural life in the 20<sup>th</sup> century (with a few exceptions) and the reliance on and connection to nature. In this collection, readers will find themselves in the rural backcountry of West Virginia, whether it’s with a plow salesman or a fish researcher, and will gain the perspectives of the rather ruthless, male-dominated, and harsh life these people lead.</p>
<p>While most of the pieces in the collection follow the trials of the native peoples’ lives, three of them fail to fall into place with the others. “Natural Resources,<em>”</em> third in the series, is one of these. The essay style account reads as an informational piece on the black bear population in Tuscarora County and contains no main characters, climax, or traditional plot. The collective lives of the bears &#8212; from their decline in numbers to protected, then overpopulated, and back to scarce again &#8212; are used by Null to depict the way of life of these people; describing the bear spectacles attended by folks from all over as “…the poor man’s safari.” Though there is no focus or connection to a main character in “Natural Resources,” Null is able to generalize these peoples’ ways of life, excusing that “In the country you make your own fun,” referring to the bear chases that were for sheer entertainment. The lack of connectivity to the reader due to the absence of characters, plot and climax gives the impression that this piece is unfinished as well as unnecessary to the collection, as it does not positively contribute to the set.</p>
<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/661/2016/12/23/263/null/" rel="attachment wp-att-270"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-270" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/661/files/2016/12/null-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://shenandoahliterary.org/661/files/2016/12/null-150x150.jpg 150w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/661/files/2016/12/null.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>“The Island in the Gorge of the Great River,” sixth in the series, is another piece that fails to flow with the rest of the stories. Not only does it seem disconnected from the others in terms of theme, erring more on the side of mystical and romantic than realistic, it lacks the deep-rooted rural nature that the other stories prominently display. The grimness of the isolated island on the other side of this “…brute river, the New, so unruly that the coal had to be hauled out by rail,” where the sick and dying are rowed across and isolated, contributes to a small-town-in-Europe-during-the-black-plague feel rather than somewhere in the Allegheny Mountains in the 1890’s. The story lacks the key indicators of jargon and nature so prevalent in the other stories. The only regional hints the reader gets are from names like John Drew and Burl, and the imperfect grammar and use of “them.” For example, “I feel bad for them people. I do. But the county’s damned foolish. People use that water. My God, them nurses washing and burning rags and burying, and just hells of people downriver.” Even the dialect lacks the distinct tones found in the other stories.</p>
<p>The second story in the collection, “Mates,<em>”</em> successfully combines nature, animals, activities and personalities that are all common to the area. It is more successful than others in the collection in creating empathetic characters while also helping readers gain better insight into what life in the Alleghenies is like. Sull Mercer is a native of the area and is more grounded in his ways than the trees on his property. His life of hunting and religion, and his lack of care for and understanding of the world outside his own, serves as a good guide to understand the natives values and priorities. The firearms terminology throughout the piece, how the .270 is “scoped with a 3&#215;9 Leupold&#8230;,” shows how integral and necessary hunting is to their lives, a vast contrast to the urban world today. The cynical and stubborn nature of Sull will enthrall readers and force them to walk in the worn boots of a true outdoorsman.</p>
<p>The most successful of the stories is the last one, “In the Second District<em>.</em>” The only story narrated in the first person, it effectively connects the reader to the characters’ thoughts and feelings on a deeper level. The story follows Roosevelt Daugherty, the son of the county chair for the Democratic party, who is facing an identity crisis similar to one seen in an earlier story “Telemetry”<em>;</em> knowing where one’s roots lie, but wanting to sever them. At times Null struggles with wording, creating accidental and out of place puns like “His face was red as his beard. <em>Gingerly</em> [my ital.], Conner unlaced Andy’s boot and slipped it off him.” These awkward descriptions and word choices don’t detract from this story nearly as much as they do from others, which could be credited to the use of the first person.</p>
<p>Though at times the flow of the collection is disrupted by the lack of cohesion between stories, Null still successfully submerges the reader into the adverse culture that is the Allegheny Mountains of West Virginia. For those looking to traverse through the woods into a world different from their own, and don’t mind a few rivers and logs across their path, <em>Allegheny Front</em> would make for a fine read. Null tried his hand at a difficult task in the matters of culture and language, especially as such a young writer, and it is an indication of even stronger books to come.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond Autobiography: Claudia Emerson Through Three Poems on Race</span><br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">To live in hearts we leave behind is not to die</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212; “Curing Time”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">      Claudia Emerson did not write many poems about race. In fact, in the seven collections she published between 1997 and 2015, only three poems appear that explicitly address the topic. The poems for which Emerson is best known—perhaps a majority of the poems in these seven books—employ a voice that is, or feels to the reader to be, autobiographical. There is, particularly now only two years removed from Emerson’s death, a powerful temptation to let her biography overshadow the strength of her poems. One can find easily in the poems reflections of the poet’s childhood and adolescence in rural Virginia, her tenures as the academic dean of a girls’ school and a rural mail carrier, the end of her first marriage, deaths of her father and brother, her second marriage, and the dread and courage with which she faced the cancer that caused her death at 57 on December 4, 2014. Yet, the poignancy of the biographical details, felt by many through the poems of the Pulitzer-winning third volume, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Late Wife </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(LSU Press, 2005), does not fully account for the resonance Emerson’s poems have with so many of her readers. Her subject, often broadly but inadequately categorized as loss, is hardly unique. There is no shortage of lives marked by sorrow, the realization that everyone is one or two generations away from oblivion. Those hearts one leaves behind and in which one may live for a time die, too. Some makers, however, leave behind artifacts that remind future generations what is was like to live in their time, in their circumstances, and do so in a way that commands attention in the present. Whether future readers turn to Emerson’s poems depends upon the vagaries of taste and, perhaps, the tenacity of critics. For now, there is much to appreciate, and one way to approach Emerson more objectively is to look not at poems that bear significant biographical weight but at the group of three poems addressing race, poems that may allow readers to understand not only that Emerson’s poems are powerful but that they are made so by Emerson’s meticulous attention to her craft.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not until “Elevator Operator, Danville Virginia, 1964” (hereinafter “Elevator Operator”) in her fourth volume, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figure Studies</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (LSU Press, 2008), does the first implication of race appear in Emerson’s poems. Here is the poem in its entirety.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All day she ferried them—almost all</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">women, all white—as they rose to fall</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">in strict passage, the gondola close to airlessness,</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">curfew-dark. She filled the forward corner, perched</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">on a small, fold-down stool from which she could</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">reach with ease both the lever and the collapsing</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">metal lattice of the door. All day she closed</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">them in like perfumed birds rustling nylons,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">shopping bags, purses—and released them again</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">to the few destinations she had to repeat, announcing:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">third floor</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">men’s wear</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">mezzanine</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">—unseen steel</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">cables controlling all of them in endless,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">storied looping. Only children saw her until</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">most learned not to, looking up instead to the dial</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">above the door, its face an eclipsed compass,</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">the ornate brass needle of her voice</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">sweeping east to west to east by the northern </span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">route—as though the south were never there.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Elevator Operator, Danville, Virginia, 1964” By Claudia Emerson, from FIGURE STUDIES: POEMS, copyright © 2008 by Claudia Emerson. Reprinted by permission of Louisiana State University Press.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surely many readers are drawn to Emerson by the precision of her imagery and the gift of metaphor that makes it spark. Because criticism is in significant part a task of comparison and discrimination, it seems appropriate to site one or two other examples of imagery by which one might consider its effects and thereby add to the discussion of Emerson’s approach. An obvious choice for one example are the Dickinson lines that Emerson employed as the epigraph for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Opposite House</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (LSU Press, 2015): “There’s been a Death, in the Opposite House, / As lately as Today— / I know it, by the numb look / Such Houses have—alway—”. If genius is evidenced by a poet’s ability to address a universal subject in a new way, Dickinson surely had it. She approaches the subject of death not directly by describing its consequences for the mourners but by describing the countenance of the houses—the “numb look” of the house in which someone has died. The success of this image derives, in part, from its uniqueness—its simultaneous strangeness and familiarity—and its resulting capacity to foment questions in the mind of the reader. In this instance, one might wonder, given the slow-changing nature of a house’s constructed façade, whether houses ever look any other way. Would the exterior of a house in which a birth just occurred look any different than a house that death has recently visited? What does it mean for a house to appear “numb,” and what would the opposite of that look be?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The power of an image, however, results not only from its originality. The words selected by the poet to express the image—the poet’s diction—combine with the relevant metaphor to press the image into the reader’s mind. In “The Cows at Night,” Hayden Carruth offers an example of how precision of diction and metaphor are essential to conveying an effective image:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet I like driving at night</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">in summer and in Vermont:</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">the brown road through the mist</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">of mountain-dark, among farms</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">so quiet, and the roadside willows</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">opening out where I saw</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">the cows. Always a shock</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">to remember them there, those</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">great breathings close in the dark. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Cows at Night” By Hayden Carruth, from FROM SNOW AND ROCK, FROM CHAOS, copyright © 1973 by New Directions Publishing Corp. Reprinted by permission of New Directions Publishing Corp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scene Carruth describes would have been common in the rural Vermont. The setting and the image are pastoral and hardly unique. The mental image alone—the picture in the reader’s mind—is not the element that makes these lines memorable. In lesser hands, the poem might be ruined by slipping into sentimentality; in this case, it is not a long journey. The language, however—“those / great breathings close in the dark”—removes the image from the snare of sentiment and allows this poem to endure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the great pleasures of reading Claudia Emerson’s poems is finding that she, like Dickinson and Carruth, has the imaginative capacity and the verbal dexterity to create endurable images in poem after poem and that she exhibited this in each of her seven volumes of poetry. Although Emerson surely developed and grew as a poet over the course of her writing career, this ability was abundantly and powerfully evident in all of her books, including </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pharaoh, Pharaoh </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(LSU Press, 1997). In that first volume’s “Romantic Fever,” one can see Emerson’s talent for imaginative description in the last stanza as the speaker describes a night in her recovery from rheumatic fever: “That night I lay harbored in the darkness, / watching the doomed fireflies rise; easier / to believe the stars had fallen, crippling / in the trees. In the damp grass one lay flat / on its back, coughing up light.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subtlety, too, sometimes plays a role in Emerson’s imagery. In “Elevator Operator,” the poet never says explicitly that the elevator operator, a woman, is black. In the first and seventh stanzas, Emerson hints strongly that the woman is black, first by noting the opposite for all of the elevator passengers—“almost all / women, all white”—and secondly by noting that the elevator operator was noticed only by children “until / most learned not to . . . .” Yet, the weight of the poem’s comment about race is born not by these more obvious, though still oblique, references to race but by the underlying image of the slave trade, interestingly reversed here to characterize the white occupants as captives. The elevator is a water-venturing vessel—a “gondola”—and the passengers are “ferried” from floor to floor and back again. The poem closes with a characteristic punch, “as though the south were never there,” but the power in that line derives from the description of the elevator car as a slave ship, its interior “close to airlessness.” Emerson mentions the light as “curfew-dark,” a more contemporary allusion, but it is her references to the elevator’s “strict passage,” its “storied looping,” the “compass” of the elevator floor dial, and the dial’s “sweeping east to west to east by the northern / route” that imprint in the reader’s mind the horror and complexity of the elevator operator’s circumstance and call to mind the Middle Passage, the slave route from Africa to the Americas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strength of this poem is also enhanced by Emerson’s use of one of her favorite images—birds. Birds figure prominently in Emerson’s poems, sometimes as the putative subject and sometimes metaphorically. This is an instance of the latter. Readers will first note that the elevator operator herself, the pilot of the gondola, is “perched” on her corner stool. The passengers appear to be birds of a different sort, “perfumed birds rustling nylons, // shopping bags, purses”, and the operator “released them . . . to the few destinations she had to repeat . . . .” Both the operator and the passengers are birds, but these passengers are released from the claustrophobic environment of the boat’s hold. But to what are they released? All of the players here are controlled by steel and are caught in the endless loop—a different kind of captivity perhaps. Emerson is not suggesting that the plight of the passengers is the equivalent of slavery; it is the elevator operator who cannot escape. Yet, the reversal that turns the passengers into caged birds with few available destinations does point at something involuntary, a kind of servitude that is perhaps more subtle and not recognized—but maybe felt— by the captives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As noted above more generally, the power of imagery and metaphor is inseparable from the poet’s diction. The poet cannot recreate in the reader’s mind the image that is in hers without the medium of language, and Emerson’s diction provides that effective vehicle consistently. One might consider how “Elevator Operator” would be diminished if Emerson used words other than “ferried” (line 1), “passage” (line 3), “perched” (line 4), “controlling” (line 12), “compass” (line 15), and “route” (line 18). The words do at least double duty. They work in their denotative role to move the short narrative forward, but their connotations give the poem its power and its edge. The poem with other word choices might serve nicely as a description of segregated society in Danville, Virginia in the mid-sixties, but Emerson’s diction enables the reader to understand not only one particular historical moment but to feel the weight of a centuries-long injustice. Yet the poet never makes an overt statement about race. That is remarkable; that is poetry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Careful readers will also notice other formal elements that make “Elevator Operator” something more than an engaging picture of racial segregation in the south. One should assume until disappointed that every aspect of a poem is there for a reason. That is certainly the case with Emerson’s poems. What, then, should one make of the stanza form of “Elevator Operator”? Readers will notice an arc in the poet’s stanza forms over the course of her seven volumes. The poems in Emerson’s first two collections, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pharaoh, Pharaoh</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinion: an elegy </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(LSU Press, 2002), were written in long stanzas, often with dropped lines, that suited the predominately narrative nature of the poems. With </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Late Wife</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one notices a distinct shift to more structured stanzas; the poems are written in couplets (many with a stranded last line), tercets, and quatrains. Section III, “Letters to Kent,” contains mostly sonnets. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figure Studies</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in which “Elevator Operator” appears, is written entirely in unrhymed couplets with justified left margins. The poems in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secure the Shadow</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (LSU Press, 2012) retain distinct forms—sestets, octaves, etc.—but often employ alternately or sequentially indented lines, much like those in the “Divorce Epistle” poems in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Late Wife.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Many of the poems in Section One of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Opposite House </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">employ the longer, narrative structure of the poems in Emerson’s first two volumes. Each poem in Section Two, “Early Elegies,” consists solely of single eight-line stanzas, but Section Three introduces, scattered among the thick stanzas of Emerson’s narrative style, poems with staggered lines, uneven spacing, and no recognizable stanzas. In her last volume, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Impossible Bottle </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(LSU Press, 2015), Emerson returns to regular stanza forms, with the exception of poems in the first section, “anatomies,” which use irregular spacing, unrhymed couplets, and no punctuation in that section’s alternating “metastasis poems.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerning stanzas, three temptations exert themselves. One is to ignore the arc of Emerson’s stanzaic forms as nothing more than an accident of the forms deemed appropriate for individual poems or sections. That is certainly possible. The second is to make too much of the progression of Emerson’s poems by analyzing the changing forms in connection with Emerson’s biography, thus falling into the autobiographical trap that hinders thoughtful analysis of her poems. It does not take much imaginative flexibility to consider how the white space, lack of punctuation, and resulting rhythmic jolts and uncertain syntax, especially given their appearance in Emerson’s last volumes, might reflect the poet’s experience of metastasizing cancer. Third, one could suppose that the poet simply wanted to try new forms, got bored with the long narrative structure of the first two volumes and decided to experiment a little. That does not sound like Emerson. There is likely no definitive answer to this minor quandary, but it does seem to be worth a reader’s effort to consider the development of the poet’s stanza style over the arc of her career. There is something there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What, then, more specifically, might be said of the nine, mostly unrhymed, couplets of “Elevator Operator”? There is surely more here than a number of lines equally divisible by two. The couplet form enacts several of the images Emerson uses to connote confinement. They suggest the “strict passage” and “airlessness” of the elevator (3), bounded canals navigated by the gondola (3), bars of the bird cage (7-8), and the “unseen steel cables controlling” their “storied looping” (11-13). The stanza form of this poem affects the reader by engaging her in the repetition and constraint suggested by the content. To go further than this would amount to speculation, but Emerson could not have selected a more appropriate way to support the poem’s images than to lay out these “storied loopings” on the page.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least on one occasion, Emerson described her approach to formal elements of craft as “echoes of form” (interview with author, 2008). This is evident in her occasional use of received forms (the sonnets in Section III of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Late Wife</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) but more importantly in her affinity for rhyme and other musical features. In “Elevator Operator,” the only exact end-rhyme appears in the first stanza, supporting the building sense of confining regularity that permeates the poem. Other end-rhymes come close—“until/dial,” “compass/voice,” “northern/never there”—but the idea of loosening suggested by the slant rhymes is overcome by the poet’s ongoing use of confinement and eclipse imagery until the poem’s end, where both the elevator operator and the Jim Crow south seem to be ignored, their presence and effect now simply assumed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emerson’s focus on music, however, is seldom found in end-rhyme. One usually must look at the internal chiming—rhyme, consonance, and assonance—to see her care with sound made manifest. And as the four sentences of “Elevator Operator” roll across stanza breaks, the reader will see great care taken with syntax and how it is used to reinforce the content of the poem. Emerson ends the poem on a note of despair, or perhaps resignation, as only the last line is formally end-stopped following the description of the elevator operator’s invisibility, even to the children who used to see her, and the south’s abiding, ignored presence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither should Emerson’s attention to rhythm be overlooked. Over the course of her seven volumes, iambic pentameter is her metrical guide star, yet she is never rigid in its use. In “Elevator Operator,” she uses rhythmic variations to great effect. The trochaic hexameter of line 13 reinforces the advance and pause motion of the gondola, of the “storied looping.” The reader feels the content. In lines 14 through 17, trochees battle iambs, but Emerson ends the poem with a firm iambic closure—“as though the south were never there”—following an initial trochaic rhythm (the strong stress on “route” followed by the caesura). Meter reinforces the pessimism of this ending. After the arguing rhythms in the preceding lines—a debate suggesting that roles of race and class might be more fluid that the anecdote might suggest—the poem ends with a settled iambic pentameter line, a comfortable rhythm that corresponds with the normalization of prejudice.     </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of Emerson’s more pronounced talents is with the persona poem. In the most startling examples, the poems of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinion: an elegy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> compose a book-length narrative in which the reader is engaged immediately in the world of Rose, the speaker and “change-of-life baby” whose birth resulted in her mother’s death. In Emerson’s second poem touching on race, “Dr. Crawford Long, Discoverer of the First Surgical Anesthetic, and the Case of Isam Baily” (hereinafter “Dr. Crawford”) from 2015’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Opposite House</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the speaker is no less believable. The poem’s first-person speaker is the physician, not the black juvenile patient. Neither here nor anywhere else in Emerson’s poems will a reader find any ground for charging the poet with cultural appropriation. In this poem, as elsewhere, Emerson treats her characters with dignity. A few are appropriately maligned (see, for example, the gas station owner in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pharaoh, Pharaoh</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s “The Moon is Made”) but even then not vehemently. The condemnations in these rare cases are made all the more effective by the poet’s decision to focus more on the speaker’s pain than the perpetrator’s maliciousness. The tone is not one of acceptance, but there is no vitriol. This tone of resolution, of matter-of-factness, is evident especially in “Dr. Crawford,” and that tone amplifies the horror of the narrative.  </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Opposite House</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Emerson’s penultimate volume, is divided into three sections. The poems in the first section and many of those in the third resemble in their stanza structures the poems in Emerson’s first two volumes. The stanzas are denser and often consist of a single long stanza interrupted by the occasional dropped line. The “early elegies” of the second section are all eight lines long; they offer readers a break from the intensity of other poems in the collection but are not among Emerson’s strongest work. “Dr. Crawford” is the first of four rather macabre poems in the third section of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Opposite House</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The others are “Limb Factory,” “Irene Virga Salafia,” and “The Ocularist.” One cannot read these poems about the body and its study without considering the poet’s deteriorating health at the time the volume was published. To do more than note that relationship, however, would be to indulge in speculation not warranted by the poems themselves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Dr. Crawford” is based on events that occurred in Georgia in 1845, when Dr. Crawford Long continued an experiment with surgical anesthesia previously used in a procedure to remove a tumor from the neck of an adult friend. The doctor’s neighbor brought to him “a boy called Isam, one of her slaves, two fingers / ruined from a burn she had neglected.” The doctor administered the anesthetic and removed one of the child’s two damaged fingers. When the boy recovered from the anesthesia, the patient, according to the speaker, could hardly believe that the amputation had been completed since he had not felt it. In a horrible twist in the narrative, the poet has the doctor amputate the boy’s second damaged finger without anesthesia:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, to demonstrate that he was not</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">merely suggestible to me, I removed</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">the other finger without it. He felt it,</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">of course, as I knew he would—and I found</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">myself working even more quickly to hasten it,</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">though I was accustomed to such displays</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">of pain—and knew his would be brief, that small</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">bone insensible, easy to prune</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">as wisteria at the root. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The narrative continues with the slave owner’s signing a “certificate of witness” to verify the doctor’s account of what had transpired and a commentary on how Isam would tell this story for the remainder of his life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story is unnerving. Emerson reminds readers of prejudices that continue to devalue others’ bodies. Her effectiveness in doing this, however, is as much a matter of the poem’s clinical tone as it is a matter of content. In “Dr. Crawford,” diction is significantly affected by historical period. Emerson’s use of “quail’s egg,” “neighborwoman,” “roused him to the news,” and the capitalized “Mesmerized” helps to set the action in the mid-19</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century, but Emerson chooses other words to create a tone reflecting an acceptance of Isam’s status as less than fully human. When the neighbor brings the injured boy, Dr. Crawford’s attention moves quickly from the unnecessary loss of the boy’s fingers to the woman’s real concern—the loss of the boy’s value resulting from her neglect. Dr. Crawford’s concern with Isam, it is fair to note, is not really about perfecting his surgical method. After all, he had already performed a successful surgery with the anesthetic. No, the doctor saw the circumstance as an act of Providence, an opportunity to enhance his reputation. Emerson gives additional energy to the underlying racism of the anecdote when she describes Crawford’s concern that skeptics might see in the tale only an instance of taking advantage of a witless “simple black child.” The effect is strengthened further by the speaker’s statement of the obvious—that Isam felt the second amputation. The obviousness of the statement suggests that some people hearing the story might not believe the black child would feel pain or at least that his pain would not be much to worry with, much like one might hear about docking the tail of a puppy or a pig: “that small / bone insensible, easy to prune / as wisteria at the root.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not until the poem’s closing lines, however, that Emerson puts tone to its most powerful use. Recalling the speaker’s earlier aside that Isam’s delivery to his care was an act of God, Crawford here reveals the extent both of his hubris and of his sense of mastery, particularly over the enslaved boy:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">                   I suppose it might be compared</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">to the womb—known place and time no one can recall   </span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">and so can never forget, where fingers</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">are knit, webbed to the hand, Isam’s for this;</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">and this was no experiment, but a miracle by design,</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">a proof—like a Lazarus—and I had performed it. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emerson ends the poem with the speaker’s claim to be in a category with Jesus. The surgery is no longer the experiment it was when performed on Crawford’s friend, James Venable. It has now become a miracle, a sign, and Crawford had been selected by God to perform it. Most damning, Crawford suggests that Isam exists for the purpose of proving the physician’s mastery. Isam exists only for Crawford’s glory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before leaving “Dr. Crawford,” the poem’s rhythmic effects should be considered to determine their effect on tone. Although “Elevator Operator” has a narrative element, it can safely be characterized as a lyric. “Dr. Crawford,” although it contains lyric elements, is a narrative poem, and Emerson employs irregular rhythms to reinforce the speaker’s conversational tone. Irregular as they are, some of the lines of the poem submit themselves readily to scansion. See, for example, line 15. Its dactylic opening is followed by a trochee, an anapest, an iamb, and a feminine ending. The lack of metrical regularity and the liberal sprinkling of Latinate words moves the poem toward a prose rhythm that may well strike the reader as the more reliable monologue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like “Dr. Crawford,” the poem which marks Emerson’s last comment on race, “Virginia Christian” (also from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Opposite House)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is based on an historical incident, this one occurring in the early twentieth century. The poet introduces “Virginia Christian” with a note summarizing the basis of the narrative. An African-American maid killed her widow employer after an argument over the employer’s accusation that Christian, 17, had stolen a piece of jewelry. The commonwealth argued that the girl’s physical maturity should be reflected in the sentence, and Virginia Christina in 1912 became the first female electrocuted by the Commonwealth of Virginia. If the poet noticed the irony of the girl’s name and the government’s action, she did not reflect it in the poem’s text.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having outlined the facts in the introductory paragraph, Emerson devotes the poem to particulars: the reaction of the town’s men; the girl’s version of the incident; a description of a photograph taken of Christian at the penitentiary (an interesting word choice—the root suggesting a place for penitents—since “prison” or “jail” might work nearly as well); and a lament that a fate of this sort was predetermined for a girl born in circumstances such as Virginia’s. Emerson is not given to broad political statements, and the same is true in this poem, but that does not mean her poems are devoid of political content. The reader, upon approaching “Virginia Christian” for the first time, may be inclined to consider it solely in terms of race and inequality. She will quickly gather, however, that race in this poem cannot be viewed in isolation from gender. Emerson describes the white men of the town as a lynch mob whose members want to send Christian “to a black man’s / death.” To convince themselves of the justice of this course of action, they talk of her as a man, not as a girl. “They reported her / to have a black man’s / appetite, a black / man’s sleep, / untroubled, sound / as though from some / hard labor.” They convinced themselves that she was something other than she was so that they could unleash their fury upon a more appropriate victim, a black male. Remarkably, the poem refuses to sentimentalize Virginia Christian. By the prisoner’s own account, the girl and the widow each fought with broken broomsticks, and Virginia shoved a towel, the widow’s tongue, and some of the widow’s hair down the older woman’s throat. Assuming no racial prejudice, even if the girl had left the house when the widow was still alive, as she claimed, a murder conviction would have been likely. The poet also does not omit from the account that, after Virginia had subdued the widow Belote, she did take a ring, a purse, and some coins. Emerson even leaves open the possibility that Christian took the locket as the widow originally charged. Yet Emerson probes the particular, beyond the facts of the case, to get at the race and gender underpinnings of this tragedy. Even if matters transpired in a manner that revealed the worst about Christian, the girl</span></p>

</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia Christian” By Claudia Emerson, from THE OPPOSITE HOUSE, copyright © 2015 by Claudia Emerson. Reprinted by permission of Louisiana State University Press.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As noted earlier, “Virginia Christian” is only the second poem in Emerson’s first six volumes that uses the broken, stair-step line. The repetitive downward motion of the line carries with it an air of inevitability that supports the poem’s suggestion that Virginia Christian was born to her fate when born into her black, female body. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The forward pull of the broken lines cannot be ignored, and Emerson adds additional momentum by incorporating alliteration liberally. In the poem’s closing lines excerpted above, readers will both see and feel the repeated “w”s (white, woman’s, widowed, wrath, washing), the “b”s (buried, body, breasts, belly, bed, born, breath), and the assonance of “black,” “wrath,” “strand,” and “casting.” Emerson, of course, is well aware that the pull is nearly overpowering; that is her intent. The best way to read this poem might be simply to succumb to the flow at first and only on subsequent readings look for the handholds that the poet offers as points of reference and orientation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among those points of reference are four finely crafted images. The first, in particular, is powered by Emerson’s characteristically precise diction. Emerson describes the electric chair (and the odd aside that it was “newly made / from a single tree”) and focuses on the straps that would hold Christian in the chair as the current worked through her body, those “stiff leather / harnesses she would / wear.” The image of harness returns in the poem to describe the pooling of the current that will be loosed in the electrocution, but its first mention draws the reader’s mind ineluctably to an animal working a field. The image is not only precise but damning. The effect is supported by a second, subsidiary image, as well. The poet uses the word “scaffold” to describe the chair; the connotation of death by hanging, i.e. lynching, is clear. The third image is one of enclosure. It appears first in the horizon that is closing in at the beginning of the poem but is more jarring when the root “chamber” is used to describe the electrocution room and the locket (the container of an image). The enclosure theme continues as the image changes from a chamber to a grave in the last lines of the poem, climaxing with the final lines’ equation of Christian’s birth and burial: “her first / drawn breath / the casting down / of a fistful of earth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fourth and dominant image in the poem is electricity. It appears first in the opening lines as the gathering lynch mob is described as “a horizon closing in,” a storm cloud forming in the distance. Its next mention is in the description of the electric chair. The image recurs more rapidly in the second half of the poem. The speaker recalls the afternoon of the killing, when Christian was seen buying candy, as a “stunned / reprieve of a spring / afternoon.” This is the way one would describe a quiet interval in an otherwise stormy day. The camera’s flash suggests lightning, and then the electrocution itself is described in advance: “the black glaze / of a sky that was to come / as it always did / with August, the strike / they would harness / for her, send / into her brain a thing / she could not have / imagined, one cloven / tongue enough / to light forever / the house she would never / again see, enough / to light the city.” The last explicit mention of an electrical strike, however, is the most powerful—the metaphor of Christian’s very conception constituting both the first and the fateful strike. This strike set the others in motion, a motion that ultimately could not be resisted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surely approaching Claudia Emerson through poems that avoid the autobiographical bent displayed in her best known and best loved work is an act of evasion. It is possible that delving deeply into those poems, poems that expose readers to the frankness and vulnerability that many of Emerson’s friends and readers have found so attractive and accessible since she first jolted Southern poetry with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pharaoh, Pharaoh</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, will require more distance—more time and less personal familiarity with the poet. So be it. Emerson’s poetic legacy will not depend on her biography. Her “art of sorrow,” as she put it, is “familiar.” Her work will survive, or not, based on the merits of the poems themselves. Those merits do not depend on the poignancy of the poet’s life and death but on the attention she paid to her art.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Artist Statement: </em></p>
<p><em>            My work inhabits that elusive place where memory and reality overlap. With a concern for light and atmosphere, I lift elements from their otherwise quotidian context and elevate them to into the realm of icon. By capturing moments in time the way one remembers them – in fragments that hint at an underlying narrative – the intention is to create visual allegories that are intriguing and evocative</em><em>. </em></p>
<p>Brief Biography:</p>
<p>Linda Burgess is an artist and writer whose career spans more than three decades. She has exhibited in galleries and museums in throughout the U. S., and in Europe and Japan.  The National Museum of Women in the Arts, The Mint Museum of Art, The Polaroid International Collection, Zimmerli Museum of Art, and McGraw-Hill Publishing are among the many public and corporate collections in which her work can be found.  In addition to writing about art for <em>Art &amp; Antiques</em>, <em>ARTnews</em>, and <em>The Washington Review</em>, she is the author of <em><u>Mount Vernon’s Magnificent Menagerie and the Very Mysterious Guest</u></em>, a children’s book about George Washington’s animals illustrated by her daughter and artist, Maggie Dunlap.</p>
<p>Burgess received a BA in art and music from Appalachian State University, and an MFA in painting from Rutgers University, where she studied with Leon Golub. As an Associate Professor of Art, she taught painting at Birmingham-Southern College, and in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia as an Adjunct Professor with the University of New Haven.</p>
<p>More of her work can be viewed at <a href="http://lindaburgess.com">lindaburgess.com</a>.</p>
<p>Editor&#8217;s Note: I decided not to include a brief analysis of Linda&#8217;s paintings, as for once I&#8217;m heeding some of Barry Lopez&#8217;s wisdom: &#8220;The proper response to mystery is awe, not analysis.&#8221;</p>

who stump the hand-plow deep in earth,<br />
tilt and twist it, testing whether this year’s toil<br />
will break their backs or open wet and loose,</p>

men shining with sweat, dirt clinging<br />
to shoes, to shorts I yearn to remove,</p>
<p>men who thrust their hands in soil,<br />
finger the hole, fill and tamp it,<br />
men whose minds envision a bed,<br />
purple and yellow, crocus, iris,</p>
<p>bashful men, who come exposing<br />
their failing hearts, red tulips sunk<br />
in mossed earthen pots laced<br />
in maroon and green wild calla leaves,</p>
<p>men whose cars stay stuffed<br />
with clumps of mud and mulch,<br />
who prune with knives and clippers.<br />
Men who angle against time:</p>
<p>two lie boxed<br />
inside the dirt they worked,<br />
a third one slants.&nbsp; I, too, lean,<br />
edging toward earth.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two wealthy American widowers sat at an outside table at Caffé Florian in St. Mark&#8217;s Square in Venice, playing chess and drinking spritzes. Cass was mounting a Sicilian Defense, an opening he had recently learned in honor of the country he planned to visit, but he was faltering in the middle game.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at that puddle!&#8221; he said, partly to distract Pauly, his opponent. &#8220;There&#8217;s water coming up out of that drain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pay attention,&#8221; Pauly said, advancing his queen. &#8220;If you had bothered to read the guidebook I sent you, you would know that this whole place is built on stilts and that&#8217;s just the overflow from the Grand Canal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The overflow? If I had known that this was a flood zone I wouldn&#8217;t have agreed to come here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Check.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were old college roommates who had rediscovered each other at an alumni function after their wives died. Now, with time and money on their hands, they traveled to a different European city each year and played chess at cafes in the late afternoon following visits to local museums. They hadn&#8217;t been the best of friends in college, and they weren&#8217;t exactly the best of friends now, but they both loved to travel and to play chess, so they agreed to put up with each other for two weeks every summer.</p>
<p>The sun dropped below the Procuratie Nuove, casting long shadows on the puddles rising from the drains on the opposite side of the square.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure — ?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cass rescued his king and watched the puddles form a small pond that soon became a moderately-sized lake. The orchestra stopped playing and the waiters started moving tables and chairs into the main restaurant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe we should—&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mate in three.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What? No way!&#8221; Cass forgot all about the lake and studied the board, determined to find a way out.</p>
<p>The flood inched its way across the square and over to their table. Soon they were up to their ankles in dirty water. Pauly waved off a waiter who made a last attempt to retrieve their table and chairs, leaving them as the only people remaining in the square, two shadows at dusk.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to stop,&#8221; Cass finally said, realizing that his king was doomed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you resign?&#8221;</p>
<p>The water was up to their knees and swirling in eddies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not! But maybe we should postpone this game until later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you <em>do</em> resign.&#8221;</p>
<p>It made no difference as the flood waters reached the top of the table and washed away the chess board and pieces. The two men continued bickering as they treaded water until Cass spotted an empty gondola floating aimlessly through the square. He swam out to the boat, climbed in, and went back to pick up Pauly.</p>
<p>Their voices could be heard echoing in the streets of Venice — &#8220;Checkmate!&#8221; &#8220;Draw!&#8221; &#8220;Checkmate!&#8221; &#8220;Draw!&#8221; — all the way back to the hotel.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My wife, Alicia, told me that she never knew that she could swim until six years into her first marriage.  We sat on a nice well-stained second-floor porch at a lake rental house, thirty miles from where we lived, overlooking a cove.  Down below us floated a dock, a pontoon boat, a metal canoe painted green, and across the water only one other house stood in view. I’d gotten the place free for the long weekend, as long as I set the place up for wi-fi and figured out how to get these people’s entertainment system to work.  My job was to type up and print out a step-by-step process so future vacationers could come to a lake house surrounded by Nature, then have no problem getting on-line, or watching endless movies on those Premium channels.  Normally I’d’ve said something about how I needed payment, that I didn’t need a four-day weekend at the lake, that unfortunately I couldn’t barter with Duke Power, Piedmont Gas, or whoever my mortgage lender happened to be this year.  But Alicia probably needed some time away.  She felt as though she might be on the verge of a nervous breakdown, and had walked off her last job two weeks earlier.</p>
<p>“Because my father moved around so much in the Army, I never got the chance to learn how to swim,” Alicia said.  “It seemed like every summer he got stationed in places without lakes or pools.”</p>
<p>We’d gotten in at noon and unpacked our bags in the master bedroom.  This place had four single beds downstairs, two queen sized-beds on the main floor, and then another two beds upstairs in a crow’s nest.  The owner of the lake house, Carnell Henderson&#8211;he’d hired me out to run some cable from his house to his wife’s new greenhouse, and while I was there he asked if I knew computers, and so on. I kind of lied.  I mean, I knew that I could figure things out, but it’s not like I have an associate’s degree in computer science or electronics.  Me, I had a regular bachelor’s degree in psychology, plus a grandfather and father who worked as electricians and taught me the trade. I told Carnell no problem.  He made a point to tell me this investment property of his normally pulled in fifteen hundred dollars.  I didn’t ask him if that meant nightly, long-weekendly, weekly, or monthly.  I didn’t care.  He sounded like a landlord more than anything else, and maybe I held bad memories of landlords back before my second marriage.</p>
<p>Psychology ended up being a perfect degree for my future job as an electrician.  I had no fear of mice or rats living deep in crawl spaces.</p>
<p>I poured some wine into Alicia’s glass&#8211;we’d brought two coolers filled with chicken wings, catfish, pork chops, hamburger meat, and veggie burgers should we finally decide to go healthy&#8211;and got up to get myself the bottle of Four Roses.  We had kale, and early first-harvest cucumbers, tomatoes, squash, and jalapenos from our own garden.  I’d gone by the Bi-Lo on the way out and gotten corn, charcoal briquets, and lighter fluid. I bought four different six-packs of fancy beer I’d never heard of. Listen, if we’d had this lake house for a month we’d’ve had enough food and booze, is what I’m saying.  We brought along pumpernickel, rye, sour dough, and French bread.  Edam, cheddar, and brie.  Three bags of Doritos.  French onion and bean dip. Salsa. Hummus. Alicia’s eight bottles of Merlot and Rosé. Two fifths of bourbon.</p>
<p>My second wife pulled her legs up and set them across mine.  She wore a green and white sundress adorned with monkeys all linked together hand-by-hand swinging, like that Barrel of Monkeys kids’ game.  I’m not sure where she got it.  This might sound mean, but I was glad we had all that food and didn’t need to go out to a local restaurant, if there were any nearby. Alicia looked like a regular woman worried about her appearance in many ways&#8211;she dyed her shortish hair and worked a treadmill most mornings before dawn&#8211;but sometimes she chose to clothe herself in get-ups she thought either chic, suave, or hipsterish that I didn’t see other women our age wear when I showed up to keep their houses from sparking on fire. I picked up a pair of binoculars left out on the table and looked out at someone doing figure 8s with a jet ski in the lake’s main channel.</p>
<p>“I didn’t even care about swimming.  I never thought about it!  And then Tony and I were at his family’s reunion down at Lake Poke.  I must’ve been a little drunk.  I told you all about his family history.  Anyway, he talked me into this canoe, it flipped over when he went to stand up, and I found out that I could swim.  All the way back to shore.  We split up about a month later. You think it had something to do with my realizing I could swim and all?”</p>
<p>I shrugged.  I wanted to say something about how her last boss was named Tony, too, and that maybe she subconsciously looked for trouble.  Alicia complained for a year that he put too much pressure on her.  She worked for an audiologist, pretending to be a nurse of sorts, as far as I could tell. Mostly she worked the front desk and tried to figure out Medicare.  Sometimes she sat patients down and made them respond when they heard a beep from this audiology machine.</p>
<p>“You were, like, twenty-eight?  You didn’t learn how to swim until you were twenty-eight?  Wow.  I never thought about it. Have we never been swimming?”</p>
<p>Part of the “pressure” she perceived from this doctor might’ve concerned his wanting her to always speak just above a whisper to everyone who walked into Hub City Audiology.  And then she felt obligated to talk everyone into buying the most expensive hearing aids.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know.  After I had to swim out of Lake Poke and leave Tony, swimming became my favorite exercise for a couple years.”  Alicia re-crossed her legs over mine.  She raised her glass, then pointed it across the cove.  Just as she did, a dozen boys spilled out onto the porch, all wearing orange shirts.  By “boys” I mean frat brothers, and by “orange” I mean they must’ve gone to Texas, Tennessee, Clemson, or Syracuse.  I doubted that a fraternity would come spend the second week of June a thousand miles from their colleges, and Tennessee has a number of fine lakes.  I tried to think of other colleges with orange jerseys, but couldn’t.  I thought back to a number of gated community houses where I’d been hired out to do something as simple as changing a fuse, but couldn’t remember an orange motif in the family rooms.</p>
<p>I picked up the binoculars and looked across the cove.  After adjusting the cylinder and scanning our new neighbors, I noticed one guy looking back at me with a pair of his own binoculars.  He gave me the finger.  I set the binoculars down and didn’t say anything to Alicia.  She didn’t need more possible strife, what with her pressuring audiologist ex-boss and those horrific flashbacks that involved a capsized canoe.</p>
<p>Luckily Alicia and I didn’t say anything first, once those guys came out.  One of them said, in what I would bet a normal conversational tone, “Hey, let’s make some bets about that pontoon boat.”  He didn’t scream it out.  What with Alicia’s background in audiology, and this elective geography course I took in college that let me understand the tricky echoes that can occur in valleys, I put my index finger up to my mouth and whispered, “We can eavesdrop.  We need to speak quietly.”</p>
<p>She said, “Oh, I got that down,” and smiled.</p>
<p>From across the water one of the college boys said, “Hey, man, someone put on some music.”  Then for five minutes it sounded like background noise, like a group of a dozen people all talking at once.  I barely said to Alicia, “I hope they’re not up all night.”</p>
<p>She said, “I bet I didn’t dogpaddle but ten feet, and then went straight into the standard Australian crawl.  Maybe in the morning we can go out there&#8211;take out the pontoon, anchor it, and swim around.”</p>
<p>I picked up the binoculars and looked to the side of the house across the cove.  Sure enough: Breaker box right there in plain view, eye level. I thought, Do not do anything that would make Alicia look later for a third husband.</p>
<p>*<br />
I poured easy-light charcoal into the normal black smoker on the far end of the porch.  Alicia said she would wait until the coals were burned down before she decided what she wanted on the first day of our vacation.  I’d agreed to take the pontoon out in the morning, but then I wanted to fix Carnell Henderson’s problems, then re-check everything on both Sunday and Monday before we went home where, I assumed, Alicia would begin looking for a new job and I’d catch grief from my regular customers&#8211;I catered to a wealthier clientele who would not admit that they had mice chewing wires to the HVAC unit’s fan circuit board, or they bought elaborate outside ceiling fans for their verandas before understanding that they didn’t run on batteries. Or they forgot how to run their own dryers, blamed me, and then I had to come over and close the door to the Samsung before pushing the Start button.  House call.  Five minutes. Eighty bucks.</p>
<p>“I’m not even hungry now,” Alicia said.  “I feel like I’m not even going to get hungry for some reason.  Hey, did we bring any aspirin?”</p>
<p>The fraternity boys started playing Old School disco loudly, bands that I recognized even though they were before my time: Earth, Wind, and Fire.  The Commodores and Mother’s Finest.   The Ohio Players. I got out the binoculars again to make sure they weren’t in their fifties, or maybe their parents had shown up for the evening.  The bass reverberated across the water and made the foundation of Carnell’s house throb.  I said, “Fuck.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t bring the aspirin?  I put it out on the table before we packed,” Alicia said.<br />
I lit the grill and, in my mind, thought I foresaw what I’d be doing later in the middle of the night.  I said, “I got it.  It’s on the kitchen counter inside.”</p>
<p>“Come here, Ted,” Alicia said.  She tapped the chair beside her.  “Let’s just sit down here and do some drinking.”  She’d gotten up and relieved the freezer from its ice bin, and poured it into a cooler Carnell kept on the deck.  “You’re the smart one here.  Tell me what I should do.”</p>
<p>Even though Tony might’ve demanded too much of my wife, he didn’t harass her in any way.  Alicia and I weren’t the litigation-type of people anyway.  We met two years after both of our divorces&#8211;mine had to do with an ex-wife who cheated on me&#8211;and we married two years later.  In six months we’d celebrate our tenth year together, our eighth married.  At parties people liked to hear how we met: She had moved to an upscale apartment complex, I’d gotten hired to install lights around the pool, and we flirted with one another.</p>
<p>The next day Alicia called her landlord and said that her dining room lights no longer worked, could he please call up the electrician who had been there the day earlier. She had tripped the breaker on purpose.  A day later, Alicia put on rubber gloves and tennis shoes, then shoved a paperclip in one of her outlets, which caused a gigantic scorch mark.  She called the landlord.  Alicia and I went out to a fondue restaurant the next night.</p>
<p>I said, “Baby doll, we don’t really need the money.  You do what you want to do.” This wasn’t all that true, but it seemed like the right thing to say after two tumblers of bourbon and Coke.  I said, “You want to go back to school and take some classes?  Do that.  You want to come out with me and help out every day?  That’s fine.”</p>
<p>Alicia already had a college degree, too.  She had majored in early childhood education, spent three years teaching second grade at a public education elementary school, said Screw this, and decided to never have children.  She told me that at one point with Tony the first husband she took the pill, had an IUD, used a diaphragm, and shoved a sponge up there.  By the time I came around she was down to the pill and a diaphragm.</p>
<p>“I need a job, Ted,” she said.  “Those three years I have in the state retirement system?  It’s not even getting interest, what with the account being inactive.  If you died, I don’t know what I’d do.”</p>
<p>I didn’t say, If we had a couple kids maybe they could take over All Out Electric.  I said, “I got a life insurance policy.  We’ve got money saved up.  The house will be paid for in fifteen years.  I ain’t going to die.”</p>
<p>The boys across the way dumped out a bucket of golf balls onto the ground.  When their CD was between tracks I made out one of them saying, “Whoever hits the pontoon, everyone else has to do a shot.  Hit the canoe?  Two shots.”  I got out the binoculars and looked over there.  It appeared as if they dumped out nothing but brand new Titleist Pro V1s.  Those things cost four bucks apiece.</p>
<p>“These are really good binoculars,” I said to Alicia.  “They’re going to play a drinking game that involves our pontoon and canoe.  Or Carnell Henderson’s.”</p>
<p>She said, “I can tell you what got me depressed,” as if we had been talking about it for a solid month.  I’ll admit that at times I get consumed with work, but I felt sure that Alicia had not admitted any form of depression until this point.</p>
<p>I said, “What?” but held the binoculars back up and watched the first guy swing a nice Ping pitching wedge.  He fell short by a good forty yards.  I pulled the binoculars down, then swung the strap around my neck and let it rest on my lap.  I said, “Depression about the job?”</p>
<p>Alicia poured out the rest of the first bottle.  She said, “This is a weird story.  You have that degree in psychology.  Tell me if this makes sense.  It’s the only thing I can think of, as far as a cause.”</p>
<p>“I don’t have any advanced degrees, honey, you know that.  It wouldn’t be right for me to offer up any kind of diagnosis.  Or prognosis.  Which is the right word?  I never remember.”</p>
<p>Another guy swung hard, topped the ball, and it dribbled into ankle-deep water.  My wife said, “This woman came into the office about a month ago.  Tiny woman, maybe four-eleven.  You could tell she used to be taller, and regal.  She had a pretty bad hunched back, you know.  I know for a fact that she was eighty-eight years old, because I typed in her information.”</p>
<p>I said, “I’m listening.”  I kept eye contact with Alicia, but got up, dipped my cup in the ice chest, and got more bourbon.  I hadn’t come close to finishing even half of half a fifth, but bourbon’s a little more potent than merlot.  Across the cove, the CD skipped, and then someone turned it off.  I heard one of those boys say, “Let’s make it a little more interesting.”</p>
<p>Alicia stared over that way, but she had a look on her face similar to a farm animal lost in thought.  “Her name was Ms. Young.  Deaf as a railroad spike.  I mean, she could hear if you yelled at her, but that was it.”</p>
<p>I wanted to ask if the woman drove herself to Hub City Audiology, but didn’t.  Sometimes Alicia complained that Tony Husband #1 interrupted.  And so did Tony Boss the Last.  Also, I wanted to say how funny it is for people with the last name Young to get so old.</p>
<p>“She came in right at the end of the day.  Dr. McKinney had gone off somewhere and hadn’t returned.  I kind of think he forgot. I had to call him up and remind him, and he started cussing, you know.”</p>
<p>I wanted to say, At one of those schools for the deaf, I guess teachers could get away with cussing all they wanted.  I said, “He probably went out to play golf.”</p>
<p>“So Ms. Young took a seat in the waiting room and I yelled out at her that the doctor was with a patient, that he was running behind, and all those other lies I had to tell when things weren’t going smoothly.  When things weren’t going professionally.”</p>
<p>I said, “I only met him at those Christmas parties, but I thought right away that he had a drinking problem.  I mean, I can’t talk,” I said, raising my glass.  “But I’m not in charge of bringing sound into people’s lives. Just light.  I guess I’m an eye doctor’s worst enemy.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Alicia said.  “I never smelled booze on his breath.  At least not at work.”</p>
<p>My cell phone vibrated a little in my pocket.  I’d gotten a text message.  I said, “Hold on one second,” to Alicia and pulled it out.  Carnell Henderson had sent me a message that read, “I forgot.  Flag Day coming up.  Please put flag out on pole. In upstairs closet, on shelf.”</p>
<p>I texted back, “Okay.”  To Alicia I said, “Hell, I didn’t even know why we had a long weekend.”</p>
<p>She said, “And there aren’t great drugs in the audiology field, unless someone stabs your eardrum with an ice pick, which happens more than you’d think possible.”</p>
<p>*<br />
There were no members of the golf team in this particular fraternity.  One of them got so frustrated he pulled out an oversized driver and hit a duck hook that bounced below our deck.  I got out the binoculars to see if the guy who gave me the finger earlier might be looking, but all those boys simply turned around and feigned staring at their lake house, as if nothing happened, as if I witnessed a golf ball dropping from the sky.</p>
<p>I said, “We should’ve brought some marshmallows.  Hotdogs and marshmallows.”</p>
<p>Alicia got up, walked into the kitchen, and came back with four pork chops, but she didn’t put them on the grill, just set them down on a table nearby.  She said, “I said, ‘Tell me about yourself,’ because I couldn’t pretend that she wasn’t sitting on the other side of the window, not eight feet away.  I yelled out, ‘Tell me about yourself, Ms. Young!’ and thought I would get back something how she taught school for forty years. Maybe how she taught chorus or band.”</p>
<p>My phone vibrated again.  I looked down to see that Carnell Henderson texted me, “There’s a yellow Don’t Tread on Me flag, too.  Put that below the other flag.”</p>
<p>I looked at my wife and wanted to tell her about how we needed to trash this place, but she said, “They had one of those wildlife cameras.  You know, Ms. Young and her husband had one of those motion sensor cameras down toward the end of their driveway, pointed to the house.  In case anyone broke in, they could go look at the video or whatever and give it to the police.”</p>
<p>It might’ve been ninety-five degrees.  I got up and checked the top of the ice chest to make sure it felt secured.  I looked across the cove and watched the fraternity boys give up on their Hit the Pontoon game.  Presently George Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic would blast out of the house, that song about how people should get off their asses and jam.  I said, “I’ve been meaning to get one of those cameras for us.  I want to train it on the back of my truck, because in time someone’s going to try to steal my tools and sell them at the flea market.”</p>
<p>Alicia shook her head.  “This is bad,” she said.  “This will kill you.  Wait&#8211;that’s a bad way to put it, what with what I’m about to say.  This will explain my depression.”</p>
<p>Again, I didn’t say, “I didn’t know you’d been depressed,” for if indeed she’d mentioned it a number of times, this would only make it worse, I figured. I looked over at the pork chops and counted eight flies. I said, “Are you hungry?”</p>
<p>“Ms. Young’s husband got murdered two years ago.  She happened to be visiting her sister in the hospital up in Asheville.  She told me that she understood how she should feel lucky about it, but in most ways she felt guilty.”</p>
<p>I said, “Was he shot?”  I said, “Was it at night, and he was shot in bed?”</p>
<p>My wife held up her left palm. “I stood up from my station at Hub City Audiology so I could hear Ms. Young better.  She said the cops got the camera and checked things out.  Listen, to this.  Ted.  It went like this. Ted, are you listening to me?”</p>
<p>I said, “I’m looking right at you, honey.”</p>
<p>She said, “A deer showed up.  Then a possum.  Then one of the neighborhood dogs.  Then a raccoon.  Then that dog again.  I might be getting some of this out of order.  I know that she said to me ‘neighbor’s dog’ quite a few times.  A coyote showed up once or twice, then a man they didn’t know.  A cat showed up a couple times.  A fox.  The Youngs lived out in the country, way out there. The Duke Power meter reader.  Then that first man came again, and hung out for quite a while in the middle of the night.  He came back the very next night.  Then the camera showed Ms. Young coming back home. And then the sheriff’s deputy, and a coroner a little while later.  Like that. And then a hearse taking Mr. Young off the property.”</p>
<p>I thought, Goddamn.  I thought, None of us are safe.  “It was that guy?”</p>
<p>“That man ended up killing Ms. Young’s husband, then stealing a wallet, all the silver, a bunch of shit.  They haven’t caught him yet.”</p>
<p>I said, “Did the woman come home to find her husband dead in bed?”</p>
<p>“This is the saddest part.  She told me that when one of them was out of the house they had a Dr. Pepper rule.  They called each other at 10, 2, and 4, no matter what.  When Mr. Young didn’t answer the phone at ten in the morning, and then again at two in the afternoon, she drove back down from Asheville.  And that’s what she came home to.”  My wife got up and walked toward the grill.  She said, “We waited too long.”</p>
<p>The fraternity brothers came back outside armed with golf clubs.  They stood in a line and counted down before all of them swung at the same time.  One of them actually hit the pontoon, and the ball dinged off into the water.  I got out the binoculars and watched as they all did shots from a bottle of Rebel Yell.  I said, “We waited too long for what, Alicia?  Alicia.  What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“You need to put more charcoal on.  Or I could just go inside and put these things in the oven.  I could bake these pork chops.”</p>
<p>I sat there staring across the cove at young men dancing around, whooping, raising bottles and/or irons.  I envisioned this Ms. Young woman sitting there in Hub City Audiology, telling her story to a complete stranger receptionist.  I said, “Goddamn.  Why didn’t you tell me this story right after it happened?  No wonder you quit.  Did these kinds of stories happen a bunch?”</p>
<p>I caught myself looking at the soffit and facia of Carnell Henderson’s lakehouse to see if he’d rightly installed motion sensor cameras.  I looked off into the surrounding trees. “Not a bunch.  But there are stories like that everywhere, every day.”</p>
<p>I got up and poured more coals on top of what hadn’t quite burned out.  From across the water I heard another golf ball hit the pontoon, then another onslaught of battle cries.  I said, “I better go find those flags.  Now you got me paranoid that we’re being watched by a wildlife camera.”</p>
<p>At seven o’clock the drinking game stopped and the music came on full-blast.  It went from those Seventies disco tunes to Lynyrd Skynyrd, with the boys yelling out “Go Fuck, Alabama” during the chorus of that one song, which made me think that perhaps these scholars did hail from Tennessee.  I don’t want to say that Alicia and I had turned into the kind of people who eat supper at five and fall asleep by dark, but maybe we were.  At least after drinking way too much bourbon and wine, we were.  When we got back home and returned to normal routines, I felt sure that we’d eat during the national news, go to bed during the local news, maybe watch re-runs in between.</p>
<p>So Alicia put meat on the grill and I walked upstairs to gather the flags.  I know that I shouldn’t make assumptions about wealthy lakehouse-owning people, but I walked into the upper-level bedroom to find the two single beds, a lamp, and an old-fashioned Morris chair, plus one bookcase, loaded with hardbacks.  Listen&#8211;not that I’m a big reader or anything&#8211;but I immediately thought, Good on old Carnell Henderson.  I kind of envisioned his coming up here between rentals and plopping down to do something besides watching movies and trolling the internet non-stop.  I opened the closet to discover no hint of a normal American flag, folded into a triangle.  No, there was that stupid Gadsden flag with Don’t Tread on Me and the rattlesnake thing, plus a stars-and-bars flag of the Confederacy.  Beneath the shelf, dangling off of padded hangers, were what appeared to be six genuine confederate uniforms.  I couldn’t tell if they were moth-eaten or bullet-riddled.</p>
<p>I said, “Goddamn.  He’s one of those Civil War reenactors.”</p>
<p>I turned and looked up at the crown molding to see if there was a camera, or if there was one of those innocuous teddy bears stuffed with a camera, maybe perched against a pillow.  I kept the closet door open, walked over to the bookcase, and scanned the titles: <em>The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government</em>, by Jefferson Davis; <em>The Private Letters of Jefferson Davis; Stonewall Jackson’s Book of Maxims; The Quotable Robert E. Lee; Jewish Supremicism</em> by David Duke; <em>Mein Kampf</em> in both German and English.  Then there was a whole shelf of books written by Fox newscasters and frequent guests: Bill O’Reilly, Ann Coulter, the dude with hair growing on his forehead. The shelf below it contained books with titles like <em>How Come I’m Paying Taxes So Lazy People Can Live Off My Success?</em> and <em>Send Him Back to Kenya</em>! and <em>How Come They Can Say the N-Word But I Can’t?</em></p>
<p>I bent down closer to find those last three books self-published by CreateSpace, BookSurge, and iUniverse, and all written by one Carnell Henderson.</p>
<p>*<br />
I said, “I can’t help this guy out,” to Alicia.  She stood at the end of the porch, staring over at the frat boys.  I wondered if she flashed her boobs at these kids while I pored over a library and closet of a probable racist.  I said, “Something’s burning,” and looked over at the pork chops, which at this point could’ve been used for a tailless beaver’s prosthetic device.</p>
<p>Alicia said, “Goddamn.  I forgot.  Where’ve you been?”</p>
<p>If I’d’ve gone into further studies in psychology, I would’ve probably honed in on paranoia, its causes and effects, its importance in regard to evolution.  I told my wife all about what I found upstairs, but ended it with, “You know, it might just be a test.  Maybe Carnell Henderson’s a raging liberal, and he set this whole thing up just to see how I’d react.  Like if he called me over to work on his heat pump in the Fall, he might really want to see if I said something like, ‘Hey, brother, you ought to join my chapter of the KKK,’ or ‘You want to go out on a lynching with me some night?’ This could all be a trap.  Or one of those reality TV shows and we’re being filmed by that group of Hollywood executives across the cove, all of them dressed up like frat boys as a disguise.”</p>
<p>Alicia went and picked up my bourbon bottle and said, “You’re cut off.”</p>
<p>I said, “I’m serious.  Hey, you want me to go get out that chicken?”</p>
<p>My wife walked up and hugged me.  She set the bottle down on a table.  “I never finished my story about Ms. Young,” she said.  “I didn’t get to the important part.”</p>
<p>The guys across the cove put on that Charlie Daniels’ song about being proud to be a rebel and how the South was going to do it again.  They whooped and played air fiddles, which you don’t see that often in polite, sane company.  I thought, Where are we?  I thought, Did I take a wrong turn and end up at the far western arm of this lake, maybe in Alabama or Mississippi?</p>
<p>I yelled out, “Hey, shut up” across the way, knowing that they’d not be able to hear me.<br />
Alicia said, “Ms. Young wanted to know if Dr. McKinney could do something about making her more deaf.  She said she constantly heard her husband screaming.  Inside her head.  She wanted to know if there was a procedure that could stop sounds from ever entering.  Do you see what I mean?”</p>
<p>I looked at my wife and sobered.  I thought, Is Alicia trying to tell me something?  Is she saying that she wants my voice out of her head?  I thought, Is this her way of asking for a divorce?</p>
<p>I was about to say, “Hey, let’s go skinny-dipping and we can sober up a little,” when out of nowhere one of the orange-clad boys came around the corner of the deck.  That meant he would’ve come through the house downstairs, and so on.  I felt sure, later, that I had locked the door, just out of habit.  I’ll give myself this: I didn’t scream like a kid on his first roller coaster.  I saw the boy peripherally, turned my head, and said to Alicia, “Anyway, yeah, I brought along the pistol,” as if I really had one.</p>
<p>The kid spun toward the other house and yelled out, “Turn that down!” but there was no way anyone could’ve heard him.</p>
<p>Alicia said, “Who are you?”</p>
<p>This boy looked to be about twelve to me.  “My daddy called and said you need to make sure and turn the light on below the flag pole.  He said that after you put up those flags, turn on the light so anyone driving by can see them.” He pointed back to his house and said, “We done got our flags up.” Sure enough, a stars-and-bars, plus a Gadsden flag.</p>
<p>I said, “You’re Carnell Henderson’s son?”</p>
<p>He nodded.  “I’m Carnell, too. We own this house and the one across the way.” He pointed with his thumb but didn’t turn around.  He wore one of those baseball caps with the flat brim.  “Me and my brothers got that house for the whole week.  Daddy lets us have it twice a year.  Me and my brothers put up our car keys, you know, so we don’t drive nowhere. Me and Pierpont over there have to run the weedeater at some point before we leave, to pay for it all.”</p>
<p>Alicia&#8211;and I’ll give her this&#8211;said, “Me won’t drive drunk, either.  Me one time hit a pebble with the weedeater and shattered a window.”</p>
<p>He didn’t seem fazed.  I started laughing.  I said, “Y’all have bad taste in music.  And it’s too loud.”</p>
<p>Carnell, Jr. said, “From what me and the brothers understand, you’re just a regular worker staying here for free. Daddy didn’t say you was some kind of music critic. You want to hear loud?  Wait till you get that stereo working here, and then leave.  Half of us gonna come over here and crank the music at the same time.  We brung us two CDs of everything.”</p>
<p>Then, in case I didn’t quite comprehend what he meant, Carnell Jr. explained how one boy over at the other house and one boy over at this one would go one-two-three over a cell phone, then both hit Play simultaneously.  He said, “We gone blow this lake up, Cuz.  Me and Porter over there just talking about a way to make y’all leave early so we could crank the tunes both sides.”  Again, he pointed over his shoulder without turning.  “I’m talking stereo-stereophonic.”</p>
<p>I said, “Man, go back to your party.  I’ll get the flag up and turn on the lights.”</p>
<p>He nodded sharply once, stared at me too long&#8211;as if to scare me, I assumed&#8211;then said, “We gone eat steaks the like you ain’t ever seen before, cows raised right there on the college.  I know you can’t do it, but don’t ruin your night wishing you was me.” He said, “Ma’am” to Alicia.</p>
<p>Carnell Jr. went back through the house, down the stairs, out the door.  On the other side of the cove came another one of those Lynyrd Skynyrd songs, the one about a someone named the Breeze.</p>
<p>I poured one more drink, knowing that it would be the last for the evening.  Alicia grabbed my arm, put her index finger up to her lips, and cocked her head.  Through all that music she heard Carnell, Jr. say to one of his fraternity brothers, “About three in the morning?  We gone fuck with them people.”</p>
<p>Someone said to Carnell, Jr., “Don’t he know who your daddy is?”</p>
<p>Someone said, “Steaks ready.”</p>
<p>Of course I couldn’t make out any of these conversations, but my wife, with her audiology training and expertise, could.  She told me one sentence at a time, like a regular United Nations interpreter.<br />
*<br />
Unfortunately it doesn’t matter flying a Confederate flag upside down.  An American flag&#8211;you can fly that flag upside down in order to display some kind of distress, I guess like if everyone inside the fort has food poisoning, I don’t know.  I could’ve wiped myself with the flags as some kind of statement, kind of like I did with the last check I wrote out for the student loan corporation after they defaulted me twice for one-day-late checks.</p>
<p>Besides her bat-like sonar, Alicia possessed some mind-reading skills.  We piled the rest of the charcoal on the grill, she led me inside and, whispering, said, “Hoist the flags.  Turn on the light.  You don’t want to appear a troublemaker, so then later on Henderson&#8211;or those boys across the way&#8211;won’t suspect you.”</p>
<p>I said, “We should just leave.”</p>
<p>“Nope.  Go fix the TV and wi-fi now.  I know that you’re a moral person, Tedrick.”  She meant it, for Alicia rarely used my full name, partly because I asked her to never say it in public. “I know you never think up things like I thought up all the time over at Hub City Audiology.  You know how many near-deaf people treated me badly?  Every other one.</p>
<p>You know how many times I thought up some kind of retaliation?  Every day.  And then there’s Dr. McKinney.  Some people play solitaire.  Or sudoku. They keep a crossword puzzle handy.  Me, I started thinking up ways to retaliate early on. I guess I started right about the time Tony stood up in the canoe and forced me to swim.”</p>
<p>I stood there like an idiot, trying to remember every time Alicia wanted to change the channel to one of those shows about mysterious murders, maybe on Dateline, or City Confidential.  I said, “Let’s just go for a swim and clear our heads.  I’ve been thinking about exercising more anyway.”</p>
<p>My wife told me to fix the entertainment center, again, and to raise those flags for Flag Day.  She said, “I’ll meet you downstairs on the landing.”  She looked at her wristwatch, then took it off.  “Midnight.  That seems appropriate.  One minute after midnight.”</p>
<p>I could’ve rigged Carnell Henderson’s house so that an electrical fire occurred as soon as someone turned on the dryer, or TV, or stereo.  For a racist, though, he’d always treated me fairly.  I guess I might not say the same thing if I were non-Caucasian.  He wouldn’t have hired me in the first place had I been black, Hispanic, or Asian.</p>
<p>I got the TV and stereo connected correctly and turned the volume up on both so that when those college boys came over they’d blow the speakers. I set the place up for wi-fi, but couldn’t think of how to blow out a computer.  Outside, I raised those flags.</p>
<p>I tried not to think, You are such a pussy.</p>
<p>I tried to think, If this makes Alicia happy, then it’s all that matters.</p>
<p>I’m not sure where she found the box of roofing nails. She also held my full plastic bottle of lighter fluid.  I met her below the deck where we’d spent the evening.  Across the way the music blared louder than ever, the windows and doors to that lake house open.  And it started to rain, barely, which kept the boys inside.</p>
<p>“Here’s how this’ll work,” she whispered to me.  “We’re both swimming across the cove. You and me. It’ll prove that our marriage is better than my first one.”  Already I foresaw the plan&#8211;scatter roofing nails around the base of the flag pole, douse the rope, light it up.  Frat boys run out barefoot, and so on.  Alicia said, “This will make me happy.  It’ll make me happy in about three ways.” Later on I would talk myself into realizing that she’d lay a trail of fluid from charcoal grill to front porch.</p>
<p>I said, of course, “How’re we going to carry the nails?  How’re we going to keep a lighter or matches dry?”  I thought, We are too old and slightly normal to do these kinds of things&#8211;but figured that her third need for happiness fell into the Let’s Be More Spontaneous category, something I rarely achieved, and my wife seemed to attain only when walking off jobs.</p>
<p>I backstroked, with the box of nails on my belly and my Zippo atop the box.  Alicia swam  a one-armed sidestroke, the container of Kingsford held just above water level.  Although we never mentioned it, we both knew not to talk in the water, or on Carnell Henderson’s other property, or while packing up and leaving.  We understood not to even speak while driving home, late at night, on back roads. We required complete quietness. I wanted to say something&#8211;slowly transversing the cove&#8211;about how the Army celebrated its birthday on June 14, also, and how we kind of acted like Green Berets I’d seen on one of those movies, way back during my first marriage when I never slept well. Back then, I didn’t see myself as an accomplice. Back then, I never considered myself patriotic, either.</p>
<p>Back home, I would install security cameras, and ask my hardware guy about top of the line listening devices.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prone to a mildly paranoid view of the universe and her place in it, Ms. Hicks figures the weather is out to teach her a lesson.  She can’t imagine what she’s supposed to learn, but she thinks it probably has to do with her daily harvest of hope and despair.  Heavy on the despair side.</p>
<p>Ms. Hicks has self-diagnosed herself as everyday bi-polar.  A sunny morning with the city’s crabapple trees dropping blossoms on the sidewalk stupefies her with spiritual yearning.  Sleet slapping her face from a February wind makes her wish somebody would shoot heroin into her veins.</p>
<p>She’s learned weather has its own code of conduct and most likely it won’t kill her or even make her crazy enough to kill herself.  <em>Don’t like the weather?  Just wait a few minutes.  </em>Ms. Hicks thinks the local folk say this as a mantra against their uneasiness with ever-changing weather.</p>
<p>A lesson from the weather could be okay.  Depending on the content.  She doesn’t like the way she is&#8211;how she thinks, feels, or behaves.  Problem is, even if she could change, there are no role models.  Male or female.  Lots of lousy ones.  At least she can say <em>I’m glad I&#8217;m not so-and-so</em>.</p>
<p>A man stands on a street corner asking pretty women who walk by him, “Wanna fuck?”  He gets dirty looks, he gets kicked, slapped, punched, kneed in the balls.  Somebody asks him, “Why do you do this?  You’re taking a hell of a beating.”  The man says, “Yes, but I get a lot of fucks.”</p>
<p>Ms. Hicks thinks that joke is almost the story of her life.  <em>I’m taking a beating because I really want something.  It’s not exactly a fuck, but I think it’s similar. I’m okay with the beating, it’s just that I’d like to get a little of whatever it is that I want.  I wish I could say what it is.</em></p>
<p>Ms. Hicks has her house and her badly tended flower garden out back.  She knows she’s done little to deserve these benefits.  She won’t say <em>blessings</em>&#8211;she’s purged that word from her vocabulary.  If she were homeless she’d kill herself as dramatically as possible.  Set herself on fire.</p>
<p>The roof over her head is her defense against everything.  When big storms rampage through her city at night, Ms. Hicks wakes up and feels her house shaking.  Sometimes she goes out to her garden and squints up at the sky.  <em>Go away</em>, she whispers.  Take your nastiness off of my property.</p>
<p>Fact is, she respects weather.  Especially lightning.  Only an idiot wouldn&#8217;t take lightning seriously.  Thunder makes dogs tremble.  Cats run under the bed.  Ms. Hicks thinks even elephants must get nervous when they see lightning.  Giraffes are probably the most afraid of all.  Poor dears.</p>
<p>Ms. Hicks put in a crop of begonias.  Dug up dirt to make shallow holes, added store-bought manure, gingerly removed the young plants from their plastic cartons, gently placed them roots down, lightly packed dirt around them.  Got her hands dirty.  Did her best to savor the dirt fragrance.</p>
<p><em>No children but I’ve got my garden.  No husband but I’ve got weather.  Weather’s faithful.  It lies to me, but it stays by my side wherever I go.  Flatters me in April.  Takes me to the beach in August.  Then in February it kicks me around the house and tells me I’m an ugly old hag.</em></p>
<p>She entertains herself.  Like eating her croissant topless.  Warms it up while she’s still half asleep, goes to the bathroom, pulls off her nightgown and dines in front of the mirror.  <em>Nice boobs,</em> Ms. Hicks tells her mirror self.  <em>Don’t talk with your mouth full</em>, her mirror self tells her.</p>
<p>When she first went to college and read D.H. Lawrence she took to walking in thunderstorms.  That must have been when she and weather started up their bad romance.  She’d come back into her dormitory soaking wet, shivering, teeth chattering.  Maybe she was daring the lightning to hit her.</p>
<p>Maybe lightning would have struck her if she’d been pretty, but she was plain then and more so now.  She had a few months of prettiness as a sophomore in high school.  Like her physical self was trying to make up its mind which way to go.  She wasn’t pretty long enough to get her hopes up.</p>
<p>Plain is better.  Plain girls develop stronger inner resources.  Ms. Hicks thinks maybe she overdid it.  Her own thoughts seem so much more intriguing and funny than those of anyone she knows.  Whenever she tries to lower her standards and socialize, people give her funny looks.</p>
<p>Being plain doesn’t bother her.  What rankles her is wanting something desperately without being able to figure out what it is.  Not Jesus.  Not even full-time ecstasy.  She spends a lot of time staring out her window.  The birds that come to her garden won’t put up with her pouty ways.</p>
<p>Birds persuade her that Science is a whimsical genius.  And that maybe when the weather does teach her a lesson, it’ll be kind to her.  It’s not kind to the birds, but if they’re unhappy it doesn’t show.  When she sees a junco or a chickadee riding a gusty wind she wishes she could do that.</p>
<p>She’s eating lunch by her bird-watching window when she sees a scruffy man just walk into her back yard.  She can’t see her gate, but he must have unlatched it.  His dark jacket and pants have that shaggy, long-unwashed look of the homeless.  But he’s focused on something back there.</p>
<p>He’s wearing a baseball cap pulled low on his forehead, so she can’t see his face, but she sees that his scraggly hair has long needed cutting.  He’s taking slow steps as if he’s trying to sneak up on something.  Well of course, now she sees it!  A little wing flapping over in the back corner.</p>
<p><em>You can’t just walk into somebody’s garden</em>, she’ll tell him.  She leaves her sandwich on its plate and fetches her warm sweater from the closet.  It’s April and not yet warm.  When she steps out her back door, she feels her heartbeat.  The man must be drunk or crazy, but she’s not afraid.</p>
<p>She’s not so much angry as she is curious about why somebody would trespass so openly.  And why <u>her</u> back yard?  Ms. Hicks’s house looks respectable, but it’s small and ordinary.  It’s a house that makes a statement.  Not much <em>money here</em>, it says.  <em>Who lives here isn’t worth robbing</em>.</p>
<p>“Hey!” she says.  Staccato but not quite a shout.  Startles herself more than she does him.  He’s right there, maybe ten yards away.  Without turning to face her he uses one hand to make a palms-down gesture in her direction.  He’s no taller than she is but shapeless in his lumpy clothes.</p>
<p>She can’t tell if he’s skinny or fat.  The thought occurs to her that this person could be a woman.  She squints and looks carefully and decides it’s a man.  A darned nervy fellow to shush her and not even look at her.  But at least he’s not threatening.  She looks where he’s looking.</p>
<p>It’s a house finch having a sort of seizure.  She’s never seen a bird act like this.  She’s also never seen anybody so interested in a bird they’d trespass on private property to watch one die.  Yes, it’s a pretty thing, reddish head and neck, grey striped breast, but finches are common.</p>
<p>Ms. Hicks sees no need to sentimentalize the death of such a creature.  There are probably three or four house finches hatched for every one that dies.  What’s their life-span anyway?  A couple of years?  This is a part of herself she doesn’t admire.  To herself she admits she has a stunted soul.</p>
<p>To get a better look at the dying finch, she steps toward it.  Which short journey takes her almost alongside the homeless man.  <em>My intruder, </em>she thinks.  <em>My intruder could use a bath.  </em>The bird flops onto its back and twitches.  Ms. Hicks thinks it’s obviously in its final moments.</p>
<p>The man takes three strides, bends, and scoops up the creature.  He stands and gingerly works at clasping its wings to its body.  He seems unaware of Ms. Hicks.  She’s barely aware of herself.  With both hands he holds the finch so that its head pokes out between his forefingers.</p>
<p>The bird blinks, but it also looks calm, maybe even comfortable in the trap of the man’s hands.  It makes no sound.  <em>Maybe the little thing thinks it’s dead and this is how it goes in bird afterlife.  A giant comes along, picks you up and holds you carefully in its warm palms.  </em></p>
<p>This is one of the ten thousand silly thoughts that visit Ms. Hicks all the time.  She knows she’s smarter than most people, but she also knows her mind can be that of an unruly five-year old.  She’s noticing that her intruder’s hands are big but not clean.  Then her eyes meet his eyes.</p>
<p>His face is pie-shaped, oddly pink, and bigger than she expected.  His eyes, nose, and mouth are too small for such a face.  He looks like a character in a children’s book.  His expression is mindlessly sweet and alert but also suspicious.  He squints at her.  He’s damaged, she thinks.</p>
<p>Evidently he’s sized her up and decided he doesn’t need to account for himself or what he’s doing.  He glances around, taking in her weedy little garden, the back of her house with its peeling paint.  Also her windows are filthy.  Who is he to be making judgments about her and how she lives?</p>
<p>He heads for her rag-tag lawn furniture, a metal table and two battered metal-and-wood beach chairs&#8211;pieces on the sidewalk with “Free” signs on them she found on her walks.  No one but her ever sits out here.  Holding the finch with both hands her intruder plops himself down with a grunt.</p>
<p>She’s followed him to her makeshift patio arrangement.  Now that he’s sitting down she expects he’ll speak.  She stands and waits.  He says nothing, doesn’t look at her.  He’s a rag pile.  She’s five feet away, near enough to take in his garbagy smell.  He studies the bird like it’s a book.</p>
<p>“My house,” she says, lifting her arm in what she intends to be the gesture of a person who’s made something of herself.  She considers making another gesture toward his dilapidated shoes and saying, “My land.”  The rag pile doesn’t quite shrug, but she knows he’s thinking about it.</p>
<p>Now Ms. Hicks glances around her garden, her house, her neighborhood.  It’s not much of a place.  Her parents scrimped and saved to pay off the mortgage and leave it to her.  She’s made no improvements.  She can barely pay the taxes.  She knows the neighbors sneer at it and her.</p>
<p>The rag pile begins whistling softly and tunelessly.  He’s looking at the finch, but surely he’s not whistling for the bird’s benefit.  Ms. Hicks sits down in the other chair.  Her intruder has taken the one she usually sits in, and she hopes this one won’t collapse under her.  She watches him.</p>
<p>It’s mid-April, a fickle time of year in Vermont, but this afternoon the sun feels pleasant to her.  The rag pile is not what she’d consider human company, but she finds herself relaxing as if he were an old college friend who’s come to visit.  She’s never known a homeless person.</p>
<p>Because she lives by herself, with her imagination serving as something like a companion, Ms. Hicks isn’t surprised when she falls into a peculiar spell.  She envisions taking on the rag pile as a project.  Cleaning him up, sharing her food with him, coaxing him into communicating with her.</p>
<p>Ms. Hicks is also long accustomed to entertaining ridiculous notions, and as she studies her intruder&#8211;who seems to be wearing at least five layers of clothing&#8211;she recognizes the thought of taking him in as ranking among her all-time worst ideas.  <em>I’d kill him or he’d kill me.</em></p>
<p><em> </em>She sees his eyes flick up toward her face, and she could swear the corners of his mouth twitch into about a five-second grin.  He lifts his hands with the bird in them up and slightly toward Ms. Hicks as if he’s offering it to her.  She sits up straight and prepares to receive it.</p>
<p><em>Does he really mean to give it to her?  Is she really going to accept it?  </em>The rag pile ever so slowly opens his hands.  The bird fluffs its wings slightly but remains sitting in the rag pile’s two palms as if nesting.  It blinks, then stands up on its legs that are like twigs with tiny talons.</p>
<p>Ms. Hicks is enthralled by the sight of the finch swiveling its head like a beautiful toy.  She’s never been this close to one.  There’s a sudden soft <em>pft!</em> as the bird streaks off and away.  In an instant it’s gone.  Ms. Hicks is both exhilarated and bereft.  Her intruder watches her intently.</p>
<p>She’s a little stunned by the intimate presence of the finch followed quickly by its absence&#8211;as if an exquisite painting she’d begun examining had been whisked out of her sight.  Also the strangeness of her intruder and his behavior feel like a dream from which she can’t wake up.</p>
<p>Ms. Hicks remembers a sixth-grade classmate, a loud and obstreperous boy, whose nickname among the children was “Big Face.”  She gives her head a little shake and instructs herself to focus.  She realizes she’s defenseless and not a very competent person.  She’s has zero survival instincts.</p>
<p>The two of them are watching each other now, but she thinks they aren’t really exchanging looks as people do who want to communicate.  This is two animals, each estimating its chances of overcoming the other.  She remembers a saying of her mother’s:  <em>It’s so easy to be nice to people.</em></p>
<p>She never thought her mother had much common sense, but she’s about to ask her intruder if he’d like something to eat when he stands up and shakes himself.  <em>Like a dog or a horse</em>, Ms. Hicks thinks.  Then the man actually smiles at her.  <em>He’s beaming</em>, she thinks.  <em>He’s beaming down on me.</em></p>
<p>He pats her shoulder as he steps past her.  Then he’s out the gate and gone.  <em>He’s very good at exits</em>, she thinks.  The unappealing smell of him lingers around her, but she’s not ready to move.  Her feelings are in an uproar.  At the moment they are mostly a mix of sadness and well-being.</p>
<p><em>And that’s what I’ve been wanting?</em> she asks herself.  It’s the well-being part of it she means.  The sadness is to be expected.  In fact she expects it to expand and bully the other feeling until it goes away.  <em>I’m too easy,</em> she thinks.  <em>All I need is a smile and a pat on the shoulder</em>.</p>
<p>The sun keeps her warm, and she hears bird song, though the birds keep themselves out of sight.  She thinks that’s as it should be.  After all, the look she just had at that finch may last her for the rest of her days.  Finally, though, the air turns chilly.  She shivers and stands up.</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>Mornings now, Ms. Hicks awakes and rises from bed without her daily measure of fury.  It’s not that her days entirely lack occasions for bad temper.  When she reads or hears the news, she’s quickly riled up as usual.  If a car drives too fast down her street, she shakes her fist at it and shouts.</p>
<p>But now her rages dissolve.  Her bad temper has no stamina.  Even the loneliness and sorrow that used to keep her simmering seem to have lost their hold on her.  She thinks her new self lacks backbone.  <em>I’ve been upgraded</em>, she says aloud with a little snort.  <em>Against my will</em>, she says.</p>
<p>She accuses herself of being a fool for missing her old unhappiness.  She’d be embarrassed if anyone knew how she’d savored being so irascible.  <em>Maybe I was just putting on a show</em>, she thinks.  But that’s not true.  She doesn’t like admitting it, but she knows she felt hurt all the time.</p>
<p>Afternoons she goes out to her garden.  She actually does a little work out there.  Mostly just weeding, but one day she gets down on her knees and puts in whole row of pansies alongside the fence.  <em>Big pansy plants a bunch of little pansies</em>, she mutters.  She hasn’t lost her sense of irony.</p>
<p><em>The thing with feathers is screwing up my life </em>becomes her mantra.  She knows the intruder won’t be back, she just wishes she could purge him from her thoughts.  She gets weepy when she brings up the evidence of his taking an interest.  <em>Didn’t he pat my back?! </em>she demands of Science.</p>
<p><em>Next thing you know I’ll be going to Sunday School</em>, she tells Science.  <em>Their big guy couldn’t possibly pay less attention to me than you do,</em> she says.  More and more it pains her to glance out her window and see the empty beach chairs where they sat.  The sight is the rag pile’s insult.</p>
<p>So she’s almost back to her former self when&#8211;wouldn’t you know it?!&#8211;she glances back that way and there he is.  Not just sitting but leaning back in the chair with his hands clasped at his belly, his hat off, his face turned to the sun.  He hasn’t changed his clothes since she last saw him.</p>
<p>Ms. Hicks’s first thought is <em>What an odd-shaped head he has!</em>  Her second thought is to call the police.  She’s still got the salt in her for such meanness.  Her third thought is one that’s familiar and hateful.  <em>What if I’m hallucinating?  What if the cops come and think I’m nuts?</em></p>
<p>She steps closer to the window.  If he evaporates in front of her eyes, she’ll know for sure she’s nuts.  He’s still as a statue.  Or a cadaver.  The mild stink of him comes back to her, though of course she can’t really smell him from where she stands.  She can’t imagine why he came back.</p>
<p><em>He’s no threat</em>, she tells herself.  If he were knocking on her door she might have a reason to be worried.  She goes to the kitchen to fetch an apple, then tiptoes back to the window.  She’s foolishly pleased to see him still sitting there.  She goes back to the kitchen for a knife.</p>
<p>It’s not exactly a plan she’s thought through, but she feels as if she’s acting decisively.  From the kitchen she takes her paring knife, the apple, and a saucer.  She exits the back door, walks at a normal pace out to her makeshift patio, and sits down in the chair opposite her intruder.</p>
<p>She hasn’t looked directly at him yet.  She’s not sure why.   She sets the dish in her lap and cuts the apple in half.  Now she does look at him.  He’s sitting up straight, scrutinizing her.  <em>He’s completely ready to leave</em>, she thinks.  “Would you like half of this apple?” she asks him.</p>
<p>Ms. Hicks has kept her voice neutral and her face pleasant.  The situation interests her anthropologically.  Voice, tone, facial expression&#8211;those signals must have determined the life or death of many a person.  The rag pile doesn’t move, doesn’t stop watching her.  <em>He could just disappear!</em></p>
<p>Ms. Hicks lowers her eyes to the knife, the dish, and the halves of the apple.  “I know people who eat every bit of an apple,” she says quietly.  “Even the core and the seeds.  If you’d like me to leave the peeling on it, let me know.  I’ve gotten used to peeling each slice before I eat it.”</p>
<p>She prides herself on her ability to peel an apple slice quickly, precisely, and with a certain grace.  No living person could care about such a skill.  Even so, she’s aware that her fingers are performing for her intruder.  The peeling drops onto the plate.  She hands him the slice.</p>
<p>Their eyes meet in the split second of the chunk of apple passing from her fingers to his.  She peels a second slice for herself.  She’s surprised to see him waiting for her.  If it’s manners, she appreciates it.  For some moments they observe each other as they chew their bites of apple.</p>
<p>When she peels another slice, he accepts it.  While they finish up the apple, Ms. Hicks decides that the human face is so unappealing in the act of chewing that it’s odd they’ve studied each other’s faces while they eat.  She’s sure that people at dinner parties don’t behave similarly.</p>
<p>She sets the plate with the knife and the apple scraps on the tottery table beside her.  After some silence, during which they both cast their eyes around the yard, Ms. Hicks folds her hands in her lap and says, “I’ve been wondering what was wrong with that finch you brought back to life.”</p>
<p>The rag pile smacks the fingers of one hand against the palm of the other.  The smack is loud enough that it startles Ms. Hicks.  What interests her is that the smacking hand drops through a foot or so of space with its fingers wriggling slightly.  <em>How the bird fell</em>, she thinks.</p>
<p>“A car?” she asks.  He makes no gesture, though he looks straight at her, and his face tells her she’s right.  Exactly how his face conveys it she can’t say.  He didn’t move his eyes or mouth, didn’t blink, didn’t nod.  It’s as close to mental telepathy as she’s ever experienced.</p>
<p>Nothing comes to her to say or do.  Her intruder leans back in his chair and lets his eyelids droop.  Ms. Hicks feels a little drowsy herself.  It amuses her to think they’re about to take a nap together.  Her thoughts meander as they often do when she’s alone.  She wonders if he can talk.</p>
<p>Something makes her suspect that he can talk but that he’s choosing not to.  <em>Maybe he was someone who used to talk for a living.  An actor, a newscaster, a pastor, an academic.  </em>She detects herself making up a romantic past for him.  <em>Maybe he was a protester who got beaten up by the police.</em></p>
<p><em> </em>When she jerks awake, he’s gone.  She hadn’t meant to fall asleep.  She can’t remember ever having done so like this&#8211;outdoors and in the immediate presence of another person.  She finds herself reluctant to move.  As if she’s holding on to the few minutes she and the rag pile spent together.</p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>Ms. Hicks is confident he’ll come back.  The Pattern of Threes applies.  She thinks that pattern is hard-wired into the human brain.  <em>It’s not religion, it’s not fairy tales or myths, it’s Science, </em>she argues against the litigious voice in her that whispers, <em>You’ll never see him again</em>.</p>
<p><em>All right, it’s a willed confidence</em>.  She doesn’t care if it’s informed by her powerful desire to know more about her intruder.  She’s shameless nowadays, though she has her shame all to herself.  Nobody else knows the rag pile was here.  Only she knows about the finch. Or the apple slices.</p>
<p>Ms. Hicks has had years of training in solitude, more than half a lifetime thinking her thoughts and feeling her feelings without anyone else’s input.  <em>All by my lonesome </em>has come to be her mantra.  <em>Actually</em>, she thinks, <em>it always was my mantra, I’ve just now discovered the words for it.  </em></p>
<p>She knows she’s her best self when she’s without human company.  The actions and words of others call up the rage that lies dormant within her.  She’s especially vulnerable to Tea Party Republicans.  She has a vocabulary for them that can be activated by even a short quote in the news.</p>
<p>The rag pile, however, hovers in her mind as more spirit than flesh, more creature than human.  <em>Probably because he never said a single word</em>, she thinks.  The last person to whom she granted this ethereal status was Lucy Beth Grosclose in first grade, she of the transcendent pigtails.</p>
<p>Of course no one will ever ask her about Lucy Beth, but if anyone did, Ms. Hicks thinks she’d weep.  The times she’d played with silent Lucy Beth at recess made her whole body resonate with happiness.  Somehow the gleeful look on Lucy Beth’s face made her aware of the wild bliss she felt.</p>
<p>She realizes there must have been other times when she was happy without realizing it.  She was not a sad child, maybe moody and quirky but rarely sad.  She has no use for that word.  But she doesn’t like the words <em>happy</em> or happiness either, especially when spoken aloud.  Hates to hear them.</p>
<p>In the last few minutes she spent in the rag pile’s company she felt contented and aligned with the world.  She felt a kind of rightness about her life.  <em>If I’d been happy I wouldn’t have fallen asleep, </em>she tells herself.  <em>Happiness is for children, and even then it has no staying power.</em></p>
<p>A word that nags her but that she’d never say aloud is <em>mindful</em>.  It’s a word she associates with extremely self-indulgent people who pay thousands of dollars to talk about themselves to a person who takes notes, sometimes asks questions, but offers neither advice nor opinions.</p>
<p>The ongoing discussion she holds with herself is whether or not she is a mindful person.  She knows she constantly monitors her thoughts and feelings.  She’s so self-aware she sometimes has to remind herself that other people are out there.  That the world and time exist without her.</p>
<p>So does that make her mindful? Does that mean she possesses mindfulness, that quality that only gurus and highly spiritually advanced people are said to have?  Ms. Hicks doubts it.  She sees herself as a self-made spiritual lout. She distrusts all religious thinking.  Even her own.</p>
<p>Her intruder’s first visit was in mid-April, his second in early August.  She’s astonished that she’s continued to believe the rag-pile will return to her garden.  She no longer uses the term <em>back yard </em>for the land behind her house.  She’s tended it enough now to call it a garden.</p>
<p>In November she stops weeding and trimming, though she still takes her walking tours at least twice a day.  If the weather’s decent, she’ll sit a while in her makeshift patio.  She does that even after she needs a sweater.  Then a jacket.  She sits until she starts shivering.</p>
<p>A light snow falls just after Thanksgiving.  The days are shorter.  <em>He’ll come back</em>, she tells herself in the morning when she wakes up.  And she tries to say it just before she falls sleep.  <em>It’s not a prayer</em>!  But she feels like she’s pushing against something she’s not strong enough to move.</p>
<p>4.</p>
<p>Police are investigating the death of a 52-year-old homeless man found inside a tent off the Burlington bike path near Texaco Beach.  At this time there is no evidence of foul play.  There is some indication that the death is related to exposure, according to police. A toxicology test and autopsy will be performed, police say.  An acquaintance of the man notified police, who arrived on the scene shortly after 6 p.m. Tuesday evening and found the man unresponsive in his tent.</p>
<p>5.</p>
<p><em>Unresponsive</em> is how Ms. Hicks begins to think of herself in the days following her reading about the unidentified dead homeless man.  Her custom has been to fetch the paper from her front steps and to read it in her kitchen as she drinks her juice and waits for her coffee to finishing brewing.</p>
<p>She knows it’s him of course.  The knowledge is so absolute and problematic it feels like she’s had major surgery that isn’t healing properly.  For one thing, distasteful as it is to her even to think it, she needs a way to cope with his never coming back.  Knowing so little about him is a help.</p>
<p>She cancels her subscription to the paper, though she has to bring in a week’s worth of papers until the cancellation goes into effect.  She takes them straight to the recycling bin.  Because she knows the dead homeless man will be identified, she doesn’t listen to the radio or watch the news on TV.</p>
<p>Ms. Hicks doesn’t consider what she’s going through as grieving.  <em>I am merely unresponsive</em> she tells herself.  Actually it makes no difference what she calls it, no other human being knows about her visits with the rag pile when he trespassed on her property and sat with her in her garden.</p>
<p>When her parents died she did not grieve.  That’s when she realized that <em>grief</em> was the name other people gave to what she was going through.  A painful period of time from which eventually she would recover.  Out of consideration to her parents’ friends, Ms. Hicks pretended to be troubled and sad.</p>
<p>Both her parents, however, had been old and ill for many days.  They had vaguely wished for an afterlife, but mostly they just wanted their lives to end.  What Ms. Hicks felt about their deaths was exaltation.  They were free of their suffering, and she was free of watching them go through it.</p>
<p>So the pain of grieving as she experienced it was in acting like she felt the opposite of what she actually felt.  That was troublesome, but her performances were limited to the hours she had to spend with the real grievers who brought her casseroles and wanted to reminisce about her parents.</p>
<p>Ms. Hicks suspected most of them were putting on an act for her benefit.  Even so, she’s proud of having done the right thing.  She knows her parents would approve and be grateful to her for it.  They would know that hiding her true feelings was the way she showed the world they’d raised her properly.</p>
<p>Now in these shortened days of January, February, and March, she senses that her flattened-out spirit is an instinctive alignment with the harsh weather and dark season.  There are times when she feels herself about to plummet into despair, but she simply won’t allow it.  She fights it off.</p>
<p>She realizes that <em>I am unresponsive</em>, is what she says now instead of <em>He’ll come back</em>.  She knows her intruder would understand.  She can see his face telling her she’s doing the right thing.  Telling her without a squint, a twitch of his nose, or a tightening of his lips.  Just making her know.</p>
<p>6.</p>
<p><em>I’ve always thought March was the meanest month, Robert.  I hope you don’t mind that name.  I’ve needed something to call you that would restore the dignity my other names for you never acknowledged.  I’ve liked almost every Robert I’ve known, so that’s why I chose it.  So, as I say, March has always seemed to have it in for me, and it’s been no kinder this year.  But this time I’ve found it illuminating.  Maybe it’s been trying to get through to me all these years, and I’ve finally gotten the message.  </em></p>
<p><em> I woke up very early one morning a few weeks ago and couldn’t get back to sleep.  The wind was whistling around the house, the thermometer said it was 16 degrees out, and I knew I had to do something.  It had rained and snowed and sleeted and then snowed again; the sun seemed to have gone into retirement, and I’d been indoors for I don’t know how long.  I felt like I’d read everything in the house, there wasn’t anything I really wanted to eat or drink, I didn’t want to hear what the radio had to say, and I was determined not to turn on the TV.  </em></p>
<p><em> I felt so desperate it actually made me giggle.  4:30 in the morning, two more hours of darkness, and then another whole day to get through.  That was when I thought of you.  I was so ashamed of myself for being whiny that I felt my face heat up the way it does when I’ve done something stupid or wrong or idiotic.  But the thought of you cleared my mind, and I knew what I had to do.  It was like I’d been wandering in some ridiculous fairy-tale forest, and you came along and just nodded your head toward a path.  I was suddenly “filled with purpose,” as they say.  </em></p>
<p><em> I put on long underwear and two pairs of pants, a vest, a parka, a hat, a scarf, gloves, boots, and Yaktrax.  All that clothing was ridiculous, too, but at least I was doing something other than walking from one room to the next and feeling sorry for myself.  I went out into the snow and wind.  It was dark, but of course the streetlights were on.  The sidewalks hadn’t been plowed, but the street was clear, and there were no cars out.  So I walked out into the middle of the street and headed up the hill toward the University.  I thought the Green up there might be a good place to walk.  </em></p>
<p><em> I was wrong about that, the wind got stronger the farther up the hill I went.  I figured March really had me where it wanted me.  It had been saving up this special punishment for me, and I was really going to get it now.  But I figured I was as ready for it as I was ever going to be.  All those clothes were protecting me except for the skin around my eyes between the scarf over my mouth and my hat and parka hood pulled down to my eyebrows.  I had to walk tilted forward, and I had to take baby steps because it was crazy windy, and the street had a coating of ice and packed snow on it. </em></p>
<p><em> The sidewalks into the green were fairly clear, so I took the one that led straight to the fountain at the very center.  A blast of wind struck me so hard that I actually staggered and had to catch myself with a hand on the back of one of those benches where people sit to watch the fountain in pretty weather.  The thought that I might die did occur to me, but I was so insanely alive right then that it seemed like a trivial idea.  I was eight minutes away from my warm house.  Can a person really freeze to death when she’s fifteen minutes away from a cup of hot tea?</em></p>
<p><em> But March got my attention back with a super blast of wind that seemed aimed directly at me.  It was the weather version of a Mack truck, and it made me sit down on the bench and hunker down over my knees.  My body took the cold and wind more seriously than my mind did.  I actually made myself stay where I was, and when the wind let up a bit, I straightened my back and found myself gazing at the waterless fountain.  The campus lights focused on it with that eerie kind of purple whiteness that turned the whole green into a nightmare landscape. </em></p>
<p><em> But here’s the thing.  The wind was blowing a steady stream of sifting snow over the lip of the fountain.  This flowing grey white condensation rose up in an elegant curl.  It formed a perfect arc, which then dissolved into nothing.  I kept trying to see the exact point where the something turned into a nothing.  It was a vision&#8211;or as close to one as I’ve ever witnessed&#8211;and the sight was so compelling that I don’t know how long I sat there staring at it.  I could have died and not even noticed it.  Robert, of course the state of mind I was in made me vulnerable to what I was seeing.  </em></p>
<p><em> I knew that curl of sifting snow was telling me a truth about life on the planet.  Or it was demonstrating a fact that was the opposite of uplifting or beautiful or anything like that.  I confess I had you in mind, Robert.  You were part of the trance that held me there until I started shivering.  When I stood up I knew I’d stopped being </em>unresponsive<em>.  That phase of my life was over.  I had also come to terms with the perverse way I’ve been configured by my genetic make-up and the whole history of my life right up until the wind made me sit down on that bench.  I made sense to myself. </em></p>
<p><em> As you know, I can hardly stand the company of other people, and yet&#8211;as you can plainly see&#8211;I’m someone who needs to talk, someone who needs a particular kind of human contact. I’m not nearly as self-contained as I thought I was.  Which is why&#8211;now that April has brought us some civilized weather &#8211;I’ll be here in the garden pretty often.  You can count on me, Robert.  There’s work to be done out here.  And there are these chairs just waiting for the two of us.  It’s very kind of you to visit with me here.  I appreciate it.  And I’m looking forward to many more conversations with you. </em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Fincastle, Virginia: 1808</em></p>
<p>When trees cast their shadows<br />
in a long line, their gathered shade</p>
<p>brushing the nearest tree’s trunk<br />
&amp; branches, they may be cleared</p>
<p>in a single roiling wave. Cuts<br />
must be well-placed. The wedged</p>
<p>mouth of the notch determines<br />
direction of fall, heartwood collapsing</p>
<p>against itself upon vacant space<br />
until the hinge tears, &amp; the first tree</p>
<p>goes, forcing down the next,<br />
&amp; the next’s deep weight dragging</p>
<p>under its neighbor like drowning men,<br />
all husked &amp; stripped, limbs</p>
<p>like severed things, heart bucked into<br />
pieces inside the flesh’s splintered calm.</p>

<p>St. Louis, Missouri, 1810</p>
<p><em>I thank providence for directing the whale to us; and think Him much more kind to us than he was to Jonah, having Sent this monster to be Swallowed by us in Sted of Swallowing of us as jonah’s did</em>.<br />
– William Clark, January 10, 1805 Journal Entry</p>
<p>The curved breast<br />
of the carcass like a ship,<br />
its great beaked head<br />
beached. You arrived<br />
too late for harvesting<br />
much, a bit of blubber<br />
to season with salt<br />
boiled on the cragged,<br />
fog-shucked shore,<br />
&amp; a splash of oil, lighting<br />
a few wet nights. Into<br />
the darkness where<br />
the beast was born<br />
flows the river where you<br />
forgot my name, gifting<br />
it to the girl only a father<br />
ever summoned as <em>Judith.</em><br />
Forgivable, like most sins<br />
of omission,  for a man<br />
who  knew only<br />
the obedient child, the one<br />
trying to swallow<br />
the vastness of it: memory’s<br />
cold sinew, western sky,<br />
whale, the will of a lord<br />
who strands what he made.</p>
