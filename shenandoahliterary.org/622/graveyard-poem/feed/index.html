					<description><![CDATA[I believe this poem speaks to me so completely due to its stark contrasts between the living and the dead, a feeling that immediately hits me every time I enter a graveyard.  Although the narrator does &quot;lie on the grave&quot; and feels the &quot;concrete cold&quot; on her spine, the sun is up, her companion sits waiting, and they both belong to the world of the living.  Perhaps my favorite line from the poem, &quot;all the wives adored or endured, corseted or cossetted&quot;, also emphasizes this break between being alive and being dead.  It does not matter what these women were like in life because they now belong to the graveyard.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am probably most struck by the opening and closing lines of this poem. The idea of the engraved names being &quot;wept onto granite&quot; is a beautiful image, especially for anyone who has revisited the grave of a loved one and been struck by the sight of their name in that particular place. I also like the rustling leaves saying &quot;risk it, risk it,&quot; which I assume are responding to the phrase, &quot;it&#039;s right to be so afraid/Of love.&quot; I really like what&#039;s going on here-the eery, mystical graveyard is haunting because it reeks of loss, and that loss is made more painful because of love. The presence of death discourages love in preventing pain, but the natural elements in the poem encourage love, like the earth giving back footprints. Unlike the bodies that have become one with the earth, the footprints of the living do not belong to the earth yet, and so whoever they belong to shouldn&#039;t be so concerned with loss.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with Sam. The image of “names wept into granite” is very powerful. I envisioned an old grave perhaps with slightly faded engraving on it. Another thought I had when reading this was perhaps the grave itself was still weeping as a personification of the person who it marks. 
Although the subject of a graveyard is not the most uplifting I also really enjoyed the image of 

&quot;We wend past the mossy graves on soft earth
which takes our footprints in and gives them back.&quot; 

This paints a vivid image to me as anyone who has stepped on moss can relate to. Also, it almost suggested to me that the graveyard was not ready to accept the narrator yet, as she &quot;bounced&quot; off the moss. I enjoyed this poem a lot.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The images and fascinating diction in this poem really impressed me. The very first two-line stanza includes an image I&#039;m quite fond of, &quot;names wept into granite.&quot; The idea that tears could carve names into grave stones is a captivating one for me. In the next stanza Wootton writes of a &quot;defoliating&quot; oak and crisp leaves that &quot;flitter,&quot; both unique diction for discussing common fall imagery. I also love the image of the gravestone lids as toboggans, a moment in the poem that introduces a bit of levity, if only for a moment. The ending, where the author urges us that the danger of loss is worth the risk of loving, rings true for me.]]></description>
