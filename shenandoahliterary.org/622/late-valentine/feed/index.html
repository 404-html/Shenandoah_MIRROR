					<description><![CDATA[This poem conveys the emotion of someone who has lost a spouse. Because of the title, &quot;Late Valentine,&quot; it can be inferred that the spouse has died. This loss has affected the speaker in profound ways, to the point where even the lack of those things that previously annoyed him about his significant other have transformed into awful reminders of what he or she has lost. My favorite part of this poem is the last five lines, especially the line &quot;this makes me always late and always lost&quot; because I believe it truly conveys the immense loss the speaker of the poem feels.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think this is a beautiful poem that reminisces on what was, and the direct address to the author&#039;s lost love is very poignant in creating a very strong view of his wife and how much he loved her.  The focus on very simple things they shared makes this poem more powerful, because it shows that it isn&#039;t the big things that are remembered, it&#039;s all the routine events, such as being called to watch the news, or running out to get a wine-stained shirt.]]></description>
