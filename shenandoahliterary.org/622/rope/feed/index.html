					<description><![CDATA[I read this poem as a successful evocation of the utter horror of child sexual abuse. It brought to mind a time I saw a Francis Bacon painting and understood, I felt, his power to depict the indescribable, previously I had just thought his paintings ugly.
I loved the language till I got to the last two lines, I want the poet to stay with her own more than adequate words. I want this poet in all her work to be more direct and courageous, I think she sometimes hides in cleverness .]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with Molly. I really wish I knew more about this poem because I enjoyed it a lot but I am a little confused about what the turquoise feathers connection is to the poem. 

I really enjoyed the lines:

&quot;He roped me from the East like light rising, from the
West like light falling&quot;

The image of the light rising and falling and the use of East and West really caught my attention.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Like Molly, I really like the sing-song flow of the poem. I also the author&#039;s use of enjambement. It allowed the images to bleed to together. I also appreciated the placement of italicized words. It helped to tie up loose ends-- pun intended.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was thoroughly delighted by this poem! The sing-song repetition and cadence at the poem&#039;s opening provide a nice contrast to the poem&#039;s darker turn toward the end. I don&#039;t understand the reference to turquoise feathers, but it is intriguing, I wish knew more. I&#039;m definitely interested in looking up the novel that elements of the poem were influenced by.]]></description>
