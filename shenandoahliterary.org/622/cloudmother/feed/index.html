					<description><![CDATA[I love so much about this poem. The Maori words along with the soft, beautiful images of clouds and weather that grow progressively stronger and colder throughout the poem are beautiful and resonant. I also like structurally how the couplets mirror the unity of the mother and her son. I wouldn’t have guessed this poem was about a boy with autism without reading the endnote...I thought the poem conveyed the ideal of any mother wanting to protect her child from the same pain she experienced, which could have been from being different in any sense. And at the same time, the potential for children to follow in their parent’s footsteps remains. This contrast is nicely mirrored in the couplet structure and positive/negative weather imagery as well.]]></description>
