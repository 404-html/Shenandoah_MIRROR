					<description><![CDATA[This poem is interesting to me because it is the same basic story as a Hawaiian story I was told in elementary school.  In that version, Maui is a demi-god and he reigns in the sun for his people on Mount Haleakala, a dormant volcano on the island of Maui (now named after him).  I like this version because it focuses on tension between Ra and Maui, and it is a very different story, in which Ra loves Maui, and he attempts to slow her down.  I especially like the third stanza&#039;s use of colors that help create Ra&#039;s feelings for him, using colors associated with the sun but also with love.  In addition the use of dark and light, in relation to both Ra as the sun, and day and night, as well as the metaphorical dark place that Maui seems to be in.  The last line is also beautiful, saying that in love, you can only trap yourself.]]></description>
