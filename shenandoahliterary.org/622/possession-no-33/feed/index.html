					<description><![CDATA[I wouldn&#039;t say that there&#039;s exactly a power/powerlessness dichotomy going on within the poem, but there&#039;s a sort of powerless/being aware of powerlessness dichotomy going on. I believe that the latter is evidenced in the hard words and the soft phrases flipping back and forth in procession. The first line is soft followed by the hard jaw &quot;[shooting] out.&quot; another soft line then the &quot;clack&quot; of &quot;castanets.&quot; Soft line followed by &quot;jitter as if bats&quot; followed with a soft line then &quot;knee caps.&quot; Then a smattering of hard-sounding diseased words, one after another then a few soft lines. I don&#039;t know, I just thought something exists between the hard and soft words and how he feels like a puppet pulled around on strings in half the lines yet is aware of it in the other half]]></description>
