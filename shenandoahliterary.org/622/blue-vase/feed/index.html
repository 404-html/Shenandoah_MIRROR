					<description><![CDATA[The presence of the vase brings the story full circle.  I enjoyed reading into the Amish lifestyle and watching Lucy become the woman whom she wrote about in her poem, &quot;Hannah Binding Shoes.&quot;  At first, I questioned the image of the vase and what it possibly stood for.

The flowers in the vase are bright, but their life is short.  Their joy is fleeting.  Lucy&#039;s redeeming moment occurs when she realizes that the flowers, which parallel the quick success of the youthful Miss Hamilton, are nothing when compared to the everlasting object that holds them.]]></description>
