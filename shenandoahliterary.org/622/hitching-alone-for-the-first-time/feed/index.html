					<description><![CDATA[An interesting dialogue is worth comment... I believe that you must write more on this topic; it might not be a taboo topic but generally people are not sufficient to speak on such topics. To the next.

					<description><![CDATA[Throughout the poem&#039;s narrative the speaker is inactive. Even if she is moving it&#039;s rather slow; &quot;five rides and three hours to get seventy kilometers.&quot; But more importantly, she&#039;s only observing, the town, the alps, the rain, or being transported by other entities...the bus, the five rides. She even got dropped on the corner. There is just such a passiveness here, but interestingly she ends it with cautious optimism. The bounding rabbits show that she is ready to move, as well as anxious. But the space, the open daffodil farm and the hours of daylight remaining show that there is space and time for her to grow and move.]]></description>
