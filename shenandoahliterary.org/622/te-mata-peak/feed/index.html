					<description><![CDATA[This poem&#039;s constant juxtaposition of nature with distinctly man-made elements really made it stand out for me. Every time the author takes a moment to describe the beauty of the place she is in, she stops to interject some modern-day technology into the moment. As they walk up the mountain, someone takes a picture of it. At the top, they read a man-made plaque. As &quot;an exaltation of larks soars above,&quot; she hears music from nearby. This constant weaving of imagery from the natural world  along with the man-made helps to emphasize the fragility of nature and man&#039;s role in protecting it.]]></description>
