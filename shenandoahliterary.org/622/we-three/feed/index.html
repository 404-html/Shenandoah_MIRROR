					<description><![CDATA[I liked this poem a lot when Max presented it during the SSA conference, and  now I&#039;ve come to like it even more, especially with the audio. Annie makes a really good point about the repression of the woman as a mother and a wife, but I&#039;m wondering if that repression is also represented by her lover physically abusing her. I&#039;m a bit confused by the exchange she has with him when he tells her to &quot;get into the back,&quot; which I&#039;m guessing is the back of whatever vehicle they are in. Their &quot;struggling&quot; certainly seems like a physical altercation, but it also could be construed as sexual given their relationship and his instruction to &quot;get into the back.&quot; The fact that she feels the gun at her back makes this action seem much more violent, as well as the scream she says is &quot;only a weka.&quot; Still, the nature of this relationship with her lover does not seem like its the escape it was meant to be.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I usually like prose poems and this one is no exception. The poem perfectly captures the stream-of-consciousness structure with punctuation, progression of images, and the opening in the middle of the speaker’s internal monologue (and literally in the middle of a sentence). The poem has other conceived poetic elements such as the juxtaposition of natural versus artificial, and really strong imagery. I was particularly struck by the motif of repression, specifically of women, by both the duties of being a mother and a wife. The speaker feels trapped by these duties and also like she is natural and wild like the weka, yet neither her lover nor her family can understand her wild call for help.]]></description>
