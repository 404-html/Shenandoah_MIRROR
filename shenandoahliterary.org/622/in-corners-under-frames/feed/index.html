					<description><![CDATA[In burning his ships, Cortes took away all options to retreat and, 
I am sure, got the full buy-in from his troops to make it a successful campaign.
The game will quickly end if the mismatched pieces 
show up more and more. &#039;	The system has high tech liquid crystal display that lent great graphics in black and green. Polyominoes have been used since 1907 in popular puzzles. This game is located on a Hugh variety of free online games websites with a lot of different versions within the game, some classics and some are pretty brand-new and up-to-date.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[“After coming back inside from the farm,
Pop would hang his coat on that very peg.”

I found this line to be particularly strong. It reminds me of the little things that make a home so important. The distant memory of her father hanging his coat up on that very peg is something that the mother-in-law so vividly remembers. It&#039;s also interesting about how the little things can matter most. As the current owner of the house remembers the man who tried to sell her the house was eating &quot;Weet-Bix with gravy.&quot; These two seemingly minor memories go a long way in the poem.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This poems makes me think a lot of how often I moved as a child. I really enjoyed it, mostly because I thought it was a kind of adventure, moving to a new place, but I also remembered thinking that if I ever grew up and got really rich, I&#039;d buy every single house I&#039;d ever lived in. (Obviously not feasible, but it made sense to 12-year-old me!) For some reason, we grow incredibly attached to the dwellings we spend our years in, a message this poem conveys as well. The woman&#039;s desire to visit her old home and reminisce is one common to most people, I think. I particularly like the moment where the author&#039;s mother-in-law notices a brass hook were her husband used to hang up his coat. It reminds us that often, no matter how much things change, there will always be remnants of what came before.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like this poem a lot because it is true that every house has a story, and this one&#039;s is simultaneously happy and sad. I enjoyed the imagery in the poem. The title is also of note to me because it is what first piqued my interest, and I feel like the poem is a bit like finding a hidden treasure, just like the recounting of vivid memories.]]></description>
