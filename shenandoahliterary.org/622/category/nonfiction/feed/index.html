								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Travel cleanses our character. Travel etches its reality on our soul.</em><br />
— Steve Zikman</p>
<p>The water is dark, a hot swirl of red and brown. I step in and my feet disappear. As I feel for the edges of steps and sink down, heat attacks my naked calves, thighs, buttocks, and belly.  My body shudders. I pause to equalize with the water, run my hands through the bath until pain becomes pleasure. Flattening my back against the tiled wall, I slowly slide down to my chin.</p>
<p>I have bathed since I was a child, of course, but I have never bathed like this, in the waters of a Japanese hot spring rich with iron and salt. I am in the town of Arima set into the northern slope of Mt. Rokko above Kobe. Here, hot water is a ritual for the Japanese, an immersion into culture for the traveler.</p>
<p>“Few visitors to Japan fail to remark on the extraordinary Japanese passion for bathing,&#8221; writes Peter Gilli in his book on the Japanese bath. “The early Chinese historians commented in the third century A.D. on the peculiar habits of their primitive island neighbors to the east. The Christian missionaries and traders of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and foreign tourists, soldiers, students, and businessmen of the present day—all have quickly taken note of the Japanese penchant for frequent bathing, their custom of bathing communally, and their delight in soaking in waters so hot as to seem beyond human tolerance.” A sign above the pool at Arima reads 42 degrees Centigrade; 107.6 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>*<br />
My husband, David, and I were in Japan on a two-week trip. One week in Tokyo where he taught a class in geophysics, and I used trains and subways to navigate and explore the city. One week traveling together to the temples of Kyoto, the A-bomb memorials of Hiroshima, the weaving village of Arimatsu. And to the hot springs at Arima.</p>
<p>Within the bedrock of our marriage, travel is one of the glittering minerals. Throughout our three decades as a couple, we have mined other countries for the sensations that shake us awake, rearrange our inner landscapes, teach us the question marks of our own culture. We decided to marry only after we knew we traveled well together.</p>
<p>Our trip to Arima began on a bullet train, a <em>shinkansen</em>, headed south from Tokyo to visit friends who live near Kobe. Fred and Kiyoko had recently moved into a townhouse built into the hillside above the town of Takarazuka. We were invited to stay with them.</p>
<p>“The house starts here,” said Fred the first time we entered their home, dragging our luggage up the first two flights of stairs. “This is where you take off your shoes.” Street shoes are not worn inside a Japanese home. We added ours to the slippers, flip-flops, and running shoes already kicked off there.</p>
<p>Fred is a professor of English at a Japanese university. He is American, tall with graying blond hair, my friend of many decades, since we were in college together. Japan has been home since the 1980s. Kiyoko is his wife. She is Japanese, from the northern island of Hokkaido. With chin-length black hair and wire-rim glasses, she is lithe and moves as if she has little springs in her legs. She is many inches shorter than we three Americans, who all hit at least six feet.</p>
<p>That first evening Kiyoko set out a dinner of<em> shabu shabu</em>. We sat on the floor at a kotatsu where a red plastic tablecloth—puffy and padded like a winter jacket—draped over our laps as we stretched our legs into the warmth of a heat lamp set into the underside of the low table. With chopsticks we clasped fat white oysters, marbled slices of red beef, thin slabs of pink pork and plunged them into the simmering broth of the shabu shabu pot. We swished our selections until judging them cooked and swooped them into our bowls. With chopsticks to mouth we savored the welcome, the warmth on this cold February night.</p>
<p>David and I slept in their <em>tatami</em> room, a traditional Japanese space within an otherwise Western-style home. To enter we slid open the<em> shoji</em> of wood frame and opaque paper.  We snuggled into the softness of futons spread upon the floor and fell into sleep scented by the sweet grass of the mats beneath.</p>
<p>***<br />
<em>Sento</em> is the Japanese word for public bathhouse. It combines the characters for “sen,” money, and “toh,” hot water. It began to appear in writing in 1401, an indication that, by the 13th century, bathing in Japan had spread beyond its original uses for the ritual lustrations of temple priests, the healing of the sick. A <em>sento</em> that offers the hot water of a natural spring is an “ohn-sen,” <em>onsen</em>. When I paid my money at the bathhouse at Arima to enter naked with other women in a communal bath, I paid to enter into a tradition.</p>
<p>But what can an outsider understand of the passions of another culture so dense with history and centuries of practice? According to Scott Clark, most Japanese were still regular “social bathers” at the beginning of the twentieth century. Because of the lack of baths in private homes and the abundance of neighborhood <em>sentos</em>, “they bathed with their families and neighbors and while so doing exchanged news, gossip, and ideas, thus reinforcing a sense of community.” And though the practice thinned as baths were placed in houses, what has not waned is the allure of hot water rising from the tens of thousands of natural hot springs found in volcanic Japan.</p>
<p>***<br />
The next day was a Sunday. Fred and Kiyoko were free of requirements at work and home. There was sunshine and a bit of warmth that spoke of the coming spring. We decided to take a hike in the nearby mountains and end at Arima for a bath. It was a route Fred had taken once before. We walked from their house to the train station and followed them through a chain of changes, express to locals, then up streets to a cable car station where we sat backwards as the funicular screeched and groaned up the steep mountainside of Mt. Rokko.</p>
<p>From the observation deck at the top, the density of Kobe spread out below us—clustered cubes of buildings, right angles of artificial islands and docks, the straight line of an airport runway where a jet knifed onto its landing path through the blue haze of dirty air. We spoke of the great earthquake in 1995, the death and destruction, now covered. The city was rebuilt before Fred and Kiyoko arrived.</p>
<p>David and I know that we too could suffer a great quake like Kobe’s. We live in Seattle, on the other side of the Ring of Fire, that zone encircling the Pacific Ocean where the great tectonic plates of the planet are colliding in slow crashes that can unleash monstrous and destructive powers.</p>
<p>The islands of Japan are a geological jumble of tectonic plates: to the southwest, the Amurian, once part of the great Eurasian continental plate; to the north, the small Okhotsk that some scientists say used to be part of the North American continent. Offshore, to the east, the oceanic Pacific plate is being bent, cracked, swallowed beneath the Philippine Plate that pushes in from the south.</p>
<p>This jumble riddles Japan with earthquakes, some of which are deadly, and with volcanoes, which can be both deadly in their eruptions and lovely in their liberality in the landscape. The molten rock of the volcanoes is the source of heat for many of Japan’s hot springs; abundant fractures provide abundant escape routes for underground water to travel to the surface. Hot water as reward for living in a landscape that can be deadly.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>We had lunch late in the afternoon in the restaurant near the observation deck: curried beef with rice, bowls of <em>udon</em> noodles and shrimp, and cups of tea, <em>bancha</em>. Armored by food, we set out for Arima, an all-downhill hike from the top. Wooden signs and maps, mostly in Japanese, were posted along the trail. One of the first showed a big pig and warned of the wild boar that live in the surrounding forests.</p>
<p>“Boar? “ I asked, when I heard Fred’s translation. I tried to keep my voice casual, unconcerned. “Are they a problem?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so,” said Fred. I was not reassured.</p>
<p>It was a springlike day, but the sun was still at the low angle of winter. As we walked we were soon swallowed by the shade of valleys. Dusk was settling like a veil.  None of us had a flashlight, not even a cell phone. Suddenly, nighttime felt too close to be at the beginning of a hike down a steep and rocky trail. The signs were not always clear. Fred and Kiyoko read aloud the characters carved into the wood. We ran our fingers over the lines for the trail, compared them to the map Fred had brought. It was hard to tell where we were: near the first dam, an angular concrete bulwark that reared above the riverbed, dry at this time of year? Or we were next to the second dam, downstream?  Should we go right or left when the path branched? We made our choices and continued on, hoping we were right.</p>
<p>Down, down, down. I stepped slowly over, around, between rocks in the trail to keep sprained ankles at bay. My knees whined. My feet throbbed. I held my complaining inside. Once I heard a rustle in the woods and startled, thinking of boar. Fred teased me about spending a night in the woods with the wild pigs. I tried to laugh back but when David stopped to take a photo I urged him on. To soothe my spirits, I held onto the thought of hot water.</p>
<p>By the time we reached the relief of Arima, the streetlights were coming on.</p>
<p>***<br />
With a recorded history from 631 A.D., Arima is one of the oldest hot spring resorts in Japan. It was discovered, the myth goes, when two gods noticed injured crows splashing in a puddle of hot water. Within days the crows were cured and the gods were convinced: the waters held the power to heal. There is another story of a visitor to the springs, a sick and aged man who turned into a golden Buddha after a good soak. Then there is the feudal lord who unified Japan in 1590, said to have brought his infertile wife to the baths for a cure. I have found no record of whether or not it worked.</p>
<p>There are two types of hot water at Arima. The <em>kinsen</em>, the golden waters, are born from deep within the Earth, from molten rock, magma, that released fluids as it cooled. These are the deep brines of Arima, rich with iron, the source of their reddish brown color. Like cloudy tea. Like red smoke. Like rust. The <em>kinsen</em> are unlike any others in Japan and they are twice as salty as the sea.</p>
<p>The other waters at Arima are the <em>ginsen</em>, the silver waters, clear and carrying carbonic acid, waters that can be drunk as a stomach purifier, some say. The <em>ginsen</em> began as rain that fell from the skies of an ancient world, then percolated downward through cracks in the crust of the Earth, traveling deep enough to be made hot by heat and pressure. These are the meteoric waters, atmospheric in origin. At another hot spring in Japan, not far from Arima, the meteoric waters are thought to be 16 million years old. The Miocene epoch. Fossil water. Paleowater. This astounds me. The thought of bathing in ancient water. What was happening at the surface when this rainwater formed and fell?</p>
<p>Meteoric or magmatic, all the waters are travelers, made buoyant and energetic with heat, compelled to journey upward through cracks toward their cravings for the lower pressures of the surface. As they travel they are changed. The waters reach the top as a rock potage rich with minerals etched from below. At Arima, the waters emerge at 200 degrees Fahrenheit. Dangerously hot. Deadly hot. Waters that must be cooled to be bearable to a bather.</p>
<p>***<br />
In the darkness at the end of our hike, we saw little of Arima, but I have read it is a pretty town, famous for an abundance of <em>onsen</em>, temples, shrines, parks, and hotels. Shops were closing early on this Sunday evening and the streets were sparse of people. We followed Kiyoko like sheep following a shepherd, knowing that she, who had grown up in a hot springs town, whose father had worked at an <em>onsen</em> in Hokkaido, would lead us to a good place. We were tired, ready to stop walking, ready to release our bodies to the baths.</p>
<p>She chose an <em>onsen</em> where the baths were filled with <em>kinsen</em>. Walking into the lobby felt like entering a hotel. It was brightly lit and crowded with people, some of whom sat on wooden benches, faces flushed, wet black hair combed smooth, waiting for friends, family to emerge from the baths and join them. We followed Kiyoko into a room with walls of small cupboards, some with keys sticking out. Shoe lockers. My feet wriggled with the relief of being freed as I levered off my shoes, tucked them into an empty locker, and slid the wristband with key over my hand.</p>
<p>Kiyoko bought our tickets at a counter and handed them out. Our husbands went left. We went right.</p>
<p>Traveling in Japan, a country known for its precise and complex codes of behavior, its expectations of conformity, I had found the Japanese accommodating and kind, forgiving of a foreigner’s mistakes: standing in the wrong line waiting for the bullet train; forgetting to remove my shoes before I stepped into a temple. When we had met up with Fred in the public plaza of his university, I had asked if it was all right to give him hug. “Sure,” he said. “We’re foreigners. We can get away with it.”</p>
<p>But I knew there was one place that leniency was not likely to extend: the public baths. The rules of behavior are rigid. I was afraid I might make a mistake. I did not want to offend. I was glad to have come to Arima with Kiyoko as my guide.</p>
<p>In the women’s changing room, we peeled off our clothes and put them away in lockers.  Kiyoko handed me one large and one small towel that she had carried in her backpack. She opened the sliding doors to the baths. Instantly my glasses fogged. My bare thighs, dry from the hike in cold air, chafed by the rub of cloth against skin, sparkled with pricks of pain. I did not know why. Later I realized even the air of the golden <em>onsen</em> was salty.  The room we entered was cavernous but filled with the spatter of splashing water, the chime of female voices, ringing and ringing again off the tiled walls. I followed Kiyoko’s shape through the hot fog to a row of showerheads with faucets below. She pointed me to a low stool and a large plastic bowl on the floor. I copied everything she did: Soap well. Shampoo. Rinse. Rinse again. In Japan you must enter the bath with a clean body. This is the most important cultural point to remember.</p>
<p>***<br />
Although I was at Arima only for the heat, for the soothing release of muscle melting into hot water, the balneotherapeutic properties of spring water are highly valued in Japan. Balneotherapy: the treatment of disease by bathing, from Latin, <em>balneum</em>, bath. The therapeutic qualities are derived not only from the heat and but also from the minerals once held in the rocks: albite, chlorite, calcite, epidote, muscovite, sphaelerite, pyrite, galena, and siderite. Minerals that the water has resolved into the chemical elements of potassium, lithium, calcium, magnesium, iron, bromine, sulfur, sodium and chloride.</p>
<p>In the <em>kinsen</em> of Arima, the sodium chloride, salt, is said to be good for rheumatism, surface wounds, infertility, arthritis, hypertension, indigestion. The iron is for rheumatism, menopause, anemia.</p>
<p>***<br />
At Arima I alternate immersion with lifting myself out to cool.  Kiyoko and I talk little. We are focused on hot water. I know my bath is not Kiyoko’s bath. Communal bathing is a combination of words unfamiliar in my culture, yet bedrock of Kiyoko’s whose life as a child was shaped by the practice.</p>
<p>I emerge from the water for the last time, unable to absorb, tolerate more heat.  As I cool, I towel off my glasses and put them on. I feel like I am viewing a woodblock print of women bathing, a <em>ukiyo-e</em> from 17th -century Japan. A woman rests against the side of the pool, black hair pulled back from her round face. Her body is hidden in the dark waters and her head seems to float, disembodied, on the surface. A small white towel, a <em>tenugui</em>, used to sluice water while bathing, is folded precisely and placed on top of her head, held out of the way of other bathers.</p>
<p>With my withdrawal from the pool, I sense that the picture returns to balance, purity perhaps. I am the only Caucasian in the baths. I was prepared for my body to be an object of curiosity, yet not once have I looked up to find eyes surveying my tall frame with too much flesh, now glistening wet and splotched red. I am reminded this is a culture untainted by my heritage of Judeo-Christian embarrassment and taboos on public nakedness. Perhaps this is why I cannot help being an observer, cannot help notice the black pubic bush of a young woman and her firm mountains of breast. I see dark brown nipples cradled in the sunken breasts of an older woman with curly white hair. Ribs, clavicle, hip bones poke from beneath the pale skin of a very thin woman. I feel like a voyeur. My American eyes are not trained to look without being seen. I am probably being impolite.</p>
<p>I rise and go to the shower to rinse off the salt water of Arima. Not all bathers do. Some leave it on believing it is beneficial to the skin. I dry off with the towel Kiyoko has brought for me. Then I cringe for all I have to put on are the sweaty cold clothes I have worn in. But even my damp and dirty jeans and turtleneck do not dim the glow of the baths.</p>
<p>We rejoin the men, catch a bus down sinuous and dark roads to return to the city.  Near the station, we follow Fred and Kiyoko into a restaurant. We feast on <em>edamame</em>, grilled fish, octopus, prawn <em>gyoza</em>, washed down with beer, hunger honed by the long hike down, the renewal of the <em>kinsen</em>.</p>
<p>***<br />
It is our last night in Japan and we are in Tokyo. We are staying at a Japanese inn, a <em>ryokan</em>, in the Asakusa neighborhood famous for its shrines and temples. At the entrance to all Shinto shrines there is a basin of water and a ladle: a place to wash hands and rinse mouth, a place to cleanse, purify before entry, to leave behind the pollutions of life, the outside world. Shintoiism is a religion of purification. One of the most important rituals is <em>mizog</em>i, purification by water. Some scholars believe this explains the Japanese penchant for bathing.</p>
<p>I decide I want to end our trip with a bath. David stays behind in the room. I find my way to a nearby <em>onsen</em>. I push coins into a machine, punch the button in English that reads “One Adult Bathing Coupon,” pinch the ticket that spits out, and hand it to the attendant at the desk outside the changing rooms. I tuck away my clothes, grab the small towel, the <em>tenugui,</em> I have brought from the inn, and go to the showers to wash.</p>
<p>There are three pools at three temperatures: 44, 38, and 18 degrees Celsius. I choose the hottest and go to the steps. As I enter, two Japanese women leave immediately. Have I done something to offend? Another woman gestures to me to come take her place in a rounded niche where jets pulse the water. I am reassured by this act of kindness.</p>
<p>I cannot bear the hottest pool for long, so I go to the cooler one where I use the <em>tenugui</em> to sluice curtains of water over my head, neck, shoulders. I rest against the side, the small towel neatly folded and placed on top of my head as I learned to do at Arima.</p>
<p>I am not the only obvious foreigner in the baths. I chat with a young Caucasian woman. She is French, in Tokyo for a year, giving language lessons, tending bar, sharing a flat with four others to save money. As we sit naked in hot water and talk, I glimpse the feeling of community that arises from bathing together.</p>
<p>I enter the 18-degree pool and the vibration of hot skin and cold water is at first painful. I force myself to stay in until it feels good. I drop my <em>tenugu</em>i on the side of the pool and submerge. I come up and use the towel to wipe rivulets from my eyes, soak the drops from my hair. I repeat the cycle—hottest, hot, cold—until I am sated.</p>
<p>I return to the inn renewed, the bath feeling like a fine farewell to Japan. As I wait for the desk clerk to fill up a flask of hot water to take to our room for tea, I study a posted sheet of instructions on how to behave in the <em>onsen</em> I have just left. I had not bothered to read them before because I thought I knew the rules. This is what I learn: <em>tenuguis</em> are not to be brought into the baths of this <em>onsen</em>. They are considered unclean.</p>
<p>My mind buzzes backward, replaying the scenes in the bath. I don’t want to believe what I have just read, but it must be true. I cannot recall seeing another bather with a <em>tenugui.</em>  I am angry at myself for not having noticed. How could I have not have seen what was right before me? Did I miss the cultural clues a Japanese would have observed? I feel blind. I feel tainted by shame. Did I pollute the experience for others?</p>
<p>After a few days back home, the sting of my shame has lessened, receded like melting snow in the warmth of other memories from the trip. I can think of the journey without first thinking of the blemish of the polluting<em> tenugui</em>. But I have learned once again that travel is immersion at the surface. It is a myth to think that as visitors we understand another culture. We arrive, we immerse, we soak. We believe the illusion that we are becoming a part of this new place, this other. We do our best to behave, to belong. Then we leave, rearranged but still at the surface, captives of the culture that carved our personal landscape.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>1.<br />
Pennsylvanian sandstone, Phil says when I ask. He’s on the river a few feet beside me. We’re cruising with the current. We’re stroking our canoes forward. For a moment, Phil’s motion reminds me of a power hitter striding to first base after being intentionally walked, but that’s simply not accurate. When paddling a river like this, it’s good to be as accurate as you can be, even when you’re talking. Phil looks like Phil, a lean and composed late twenty-something, a guy who can go hard all day on no more than a Kit Kat for nourishment. He’s a graceful and excellent canoeist, and anybody who pursues and often attains grace and excellence in physical activity has a certain look of ease, competence. There’s no exhibitionist flexing, rather a sense of him being in the right place on the river without trying and of letting the wrong place, if he’s ever there, appear just right.</p>
<p>We’re between rapids. The boulders, good gracious. They are huge, though many are not huge, and under the water there are more huge and not huge boulders. Dark stone, dark, silent, still. The dark a chemical remnant of West Virginia’s industrial heyday – the logging, mining, railroading &#8212; when they called the Gauley the “River of Ink.” Boulder gardens, rocks upon rocks, vertical rays staining the dark different shades of grey. Grey with burgundy, grey with green and purple, even pink. Boulders as large as houses, mansions, ships, and with pale lichen and spider egg sacs like broken clouds constellating many of them.</p>
<p>Rain still falls, heavy at times, and mist wisps and curls halfway between the river and the top of the wooded gorge. A golden tint seeps from the leaves on the banks and trees, smeary weather magnifying and distorting it. The water’s clear, unsilted, green-slatish, the current swift and thick, the next rapid always close. Phil wears a short, rockered, plastic canoe. The boat resembles a stretched and wildly curved Rubbermaid crate more than a traditional canoe. By wear it, I mean Phil’s knees and hips – he’s kneeling – are fitted snug into his yellow canoe’s foam-pedestaled saddle so if it flips, he can stay in the boat and roll it upright.</p>
<p>He wears a drysuit, too, and a lifejacket, and a helmet with felt fur attached over it, long tail in the back, plastic eyes glued over the forehead. When we pass or are passed by other groups of paddlers on the river, they give Phil and his helmet deco a double take. People in the whitewater world call him Furtrapper; Google it, you might get lucky. He’s not a trapper of furs, the way another canoeist with a pseudonym and cache of videos online is not really named Eddy McGnarlz. Phil’s a geologist and a serious whitewater canoeist, among other things. He’s been smart and lucky enough to marry his obsession with whitewater with that of his career as a geologist focusing on geomorphic landscape evolution of the Appalachian Mountains, which means he studies why these old mountains and rivers look the way they do. Most every week, year-round, Phil travels to paddle challenging whitewater. A couple of winters ago, he even landed a sponsorship from a canoe manufacturer that keeps him in boats.</p>
<p>There’s a little box of a camera poking up off his helmet’s top, mounted at the middle. His lean face, framed from faux-furred brain bucket to chinstrap, is all mustache and animated, joyful eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses. From the composition of his gear, the way he wears it and it wears him, to the way he moves down the river, at once studying and working and playing, you can tell he’s a fastidious, capable guy.</p>
<p>Phil finishes scanning the horizon and looks back at me. Pennsylvanian sandstone, he repeats, and then goes on, sensing – correctly – that I want to know more. Remnants of the Appalachians’ west slope. Raised in South Carolina, there’s something of a southern Mr. Rogers in Phil’s slow, careful and caring voice. Eons ago when they were huge, he says, ten times the size they are now. There was a gulf here, a lot in common geologically with the present day Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>I want to keep listening. The history fascinates and boggles me, much as this river does. I have some questions to ask, especially about the Persian Gulf connection, but we’re entering the next rapid, one of the thirty or so named rapids in the nine miles between Summersville Dam and Mason’s Branch, and the water’s loud – he wouldn’t hear me. I set my boat angle and then pause to let Phil go ahead. He doesn’t turn on his camera for this one. Above only five rapids today – Insignificant, Pillow Rock, Lost Paddle, Iron Ring, and Sweet’s Falls – is Phil likely to point to that horny protuberance on his helmet and ask, is the light blinking?</p>
<p>We pass a cargo van-sized boulder that leans on a sedan-sized boulder with, it appears to me, a turtle face profile in it. The waves build. We’re moving along. I stroke and brace. Phil strokes and braces and strokes some more. This goes on, each of us doing our thing, sort of bat-like, scanning ahead, keeping our boats travelling along the liquid pathways we read as both safe and fun. We jag left and then right, threading our boats between features, hydraulics and pourover holes beefy enough to stop a boat and beat on it, recirculate it a while. Several paddlers are eddied out just downstream. To eddy out is to park in the boily, upriver-flowing current behind an obstruction, which is usually, as here, a boulder. There’s a guy in a black kayak surfing a wave, really carving it up, throwing moves – loops and other contortiony, gymnastic maneuvers I don’t know the names of. It’s on purpose that he’s upside down as much as he’s upright. I keep thinking he’ll get blown off the wave, but he doesn’t. My shoulders hurt just watching.</p>
<p>I haven’t known Phil for long. The first time we met was the day he drove to our place from his home an hour or so southwest of us in Blacksburg, where he works in the geology department at Virginia Tech. We’d connected through friends. He wanted to check out the creek down the road from us. My daughter Sophie and I wanted to go along, to learn a few things.</p>
<p>North Creek is like a member of our family, its rock and water and plants and creatures not quite wise elders we seek to know, but something like that. We care deeply for that watershed. We love to poke around, Kirsten, Sophie, and I, for snippets of days a few times a week, sometimes whole days. We like to check up on it. It settles us. There’s also a sense of letting it check up on us as well.</p>
<p>North Creek was not the same creek now. Two days prior to Phil’s visit, twenty-plus inches of rain had fallen in the watershed over a thirty-six hour period. High water had altered its bed and banks in massive and lasting ways, as a crazy wind event or fire can change the forest canopy. The creek we’d been coming to love rock by rock, pool by pool, plant by plant by critter for the last seven years, those things were in different places now, some of them gone. Even at home or at work, I felt a little out of balance by the changes. Imagine returning from a trip to find your spouse has, unbeknownst to you, had some major renovation work done on your home – it was like that, my vexation, sort of.</p>
<p>North Creek Road, repaved the prior summer, was closed to automobile traffic, would be for months, large swaths of it washed away or buckled or covered with driftwood piles. So we poked around on foot, Sophie, Phil, and I. We explored a particular cobble bar along North Creek that day, did what people do when they stand by wild moving water; we looked around and touched the rocks and the water and felt our lungs at first, and then our whole bodies grow both lighter and stronger. There was hardly any sand now where before the storm there were beaches. The rocks seemed freshly deposited. They were; the flood had rolled them. Phil pointed out nicks in a boulder midstream where rolling stones, some as large as trashcans, had made impact. I think he mentioned a scientific term for this. We spent hours walking the banks. Phil was fired up, generous, streamlined for us a semester’s worth of streambed geology lessons. We listened intently, caught what we could. His enthusiasm and knowledge didn’t help me feel more comfortable about North Creek in its new form, but it helped me understand my awe more clearly. I saw that my discomfort was a factor less of the changes than of the process of change, how among the land’s slow, continuous, and largely imperceptible changes across time, these sudden changes, the acute traumas of extreme weather events, can arise; and how implacable when they do so &#8212; the water, its volume and power, how it stops for nothing, not rocks, not pavement or steel, not even wind or fire or the oldest, heaviest logs. And alters it all.</p>
<p>Phil drops in his open boat onto that wave now, guy in black kayak back in the adjacent eddy where I drift. Immediately Phil throws the canoe backwards and then all the way around, staying on the wave. To swallow once would take longer than what he just did. The great thing is, Phil’s done it again. He’s still doing it, spinning, carving, having a surf. There’s something insectivorous about it – segmented yet fluid motions of boat, paddle, arms, torso, head. Phil’s paddling a canoe called the Spanish Fly. Designed by the late Frankie Hubbard, East Tennessee genii of whitewater canoe innovation, the Spanish Fly, like other boats of Frankie’s shaping, is a conundrum of a canoe – you wonder in a Spanish Fly whether you’re paddling the canoe or the canoe’s paddling you or the river’s flowing both of you into some dimension so close to the origin of time and things in general that you better be ready to hooked on this for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>People call this wave Phil’s surfing Geek Wave, I don’t know why. I won’t even know this wave’s name until later, when I’m writing this and have to look it up online. Very few were online, much less able to make a phone call from a river bank I first paddled the Gauley on a day off from guiding rafts here in 1991. I was nineteen years old; in love with rivers since youth, a childhood and adolescence spent poking around, fishing and swimming and paddling the Chattahoochee in Metro Atlanta, I was now – it could be said – in a relationship with the Chattooga River.</p>
<p>Fresh from my first full summer of guiding the Chattooga, where I’d been paddling a Frankie designed canoe, an Edge, after work and on days off, I came to guide rafts on the Gauley because I’d heard the money was good and so was the water. I think there was something of a fling aspect to it, as well. I was head over heels smitten with the Chattooga, the community of river people there, its lush forests and clean, free-flowing waters, and needed to test my commitment to it. In the end, and since, no river has elicited feelings that compare with those the Chattooga still evokes in me.</p>
<p>Over the twenty years or so that have passed since the first time I was here, I’ve kept canoeing &#8212; on whitewater, slackwater, whateverwater – and guiding but with much less frequency than those first several. I didn’t return again to the Gauley until 2002. Once our child was born and another career took shape (I now read and navigate people into and through books instead of moving water; the pleasures are similar), my river-life became more local in scope. We live a mile from a fine river and a few more from some beautiful, rain-dependent creek runs, flood-altered North among them, so while I get on the water for a piece of a day most weeks, I rarely drive far to get my fix. My last Gauley run was a day trip from our then home in Charlottesville and my only visit before this one in 2012. There are regulars here, you can see it in their eyes and their ease, but I’m not one of them.</p>
<p>2.<br />
Phil and I are down above Iron Ring now. Of the big rapids, we’ve run three: Insignificant, Pillow Rock, and Lost Paddle. Things have gone very well. The river gods, as they say, have been merciful, our lines clean, accurate enough. I’m still feeling shaky, for sure, but a calm shaky, better than how I thought I’d feel now. Passing into West Virginia, coming through Sam Black Church and along U.S. Route 60 and the Meadow River this morning, I was plain nervous, anxious and excited both. In addition to my teaching job, I help my wife Kirsten run a small, diversified family farm. Among the herds and flocks, beds and sheds, is a trio of Homo sapiens, our offspring &#8212; a fourteen year old girl as well as nearly two year old twins. Ours is a good, lucky, and often overwhelming life, full of tasks that can isolate you and put a destabilizing spotlight on the smallest changes in routine, much smaller ones than a trip to paddle the Gauley.</p>
<p>Something clicked, something good when I pulled in to the parking lot at the put in and saw Phil and the rest of the paddlers gearing up, many from different parts of the country. I felt reinitiated into a tribe from which I’d wandered. I felt connected. It was Gauley Season, a special time for whitewater paddlers, and I was swept up by being part of the crowd, one the ritual-goers. The longer I hung around, getting geared up, the more people I recognized and exchanged greetings with. It settled me. Whitewater paddling culture changes and grows along with other subsets of the dominant culture, but it will always be intimate.</p>
<p>Since most rivers with natural flows run low in the leaf-brittle days of September, people who like paddling big, rowdy water migrate, many from much farther than I have come, to the guaranteed water on the Gauley. For this weekend and the following four, the Army Corps of Engineers will release roughly 2800 cubic feet per second of water from the lake through the dam each day from Friday to Monday – that’s around 21,000 gallons per second. The local economy will get a jolt as rafters and hardboaters flock to play in the juice and then camp or take a room or get gas and a meal and head home. It’s estimated that one million dollars a day gets dropped in businesses due to the releases. This morning I did my part: a few miles from the dam, I spent nearly twenty bucks at a Sheetz on breakfast, lunch, snacks, and beverages.</p>
<p>In addition to rivers, coffee is another of my favorite things, and I sipped from my umpteenth cup while milling around the gravel lot, visiting with friends from the homewaters in Virginia, many of whom I hadn’t seen since the good rains of last spring. A congenial, reunion-like vibe seeped about. You might think the heavy, wet air reeked of bulging adrenal glands and testosterone, but mostly it smelled like cooling engines, ripe underlayers, and September rain. You could hear the roar of the dam a quarter mile upstream, that forty story tall earthen mass out of which, through three separate valves of nine feet in diameter each, water blasted with a force that shook the ground as well as the air.</p>
<p>Now that’s a good old boat, a guy said to me. I was down on my knees, messing with the outfitting in my early 90’s era decked canoe. Yes, I said, a good Gauley boat. He had already moved on when I stood. There was a rangy assortment of kayaks and canoes to check out, everything from vintage designs to the latest. After a time of shorter, more bluntly sliced boats, many of the newer boats are harkening back to older, longer boat designs. One could note a similar trend among the individuals in the paddling crowd, particularly in their hairstyles, facial and otherwise.</p>
<p>Headed to the changing rooms then, one of those government-issue cinderblock, concrete-slabbed outfits, I saw Cam and Dave, local guys from home, and shared some stoke with them. Along with a few others, they were moseying down to the river, all shouldering newer longboats for a full run of all one hundred rapids and twenty plus miles of the upper and lower stretches combined. Many other faces I recognized from various river trips over the years, including people from the Carolinas and Georgia, Pennsylvania and Maine. Due to the advent of social media and digital photography, as well as my own appetite for river talk and eye candy, I also noticed people whom I’d never met but seen in whitewater videos online. This was strange for me, but I rolled with it. In all, license tags represented fourteen different states, including Colorado and Alaska, and those were just the private boaters’ vehicles, a rough count. Who knows where all of the 10,000 or so commercial rafting customers come from over the course of these twenty dam release-days.</p>
<p>Phil’s being patient with me. My right knee’s achy and I need this stretch before we run Iron Ring. He’s ready to go, doesn’t need to look at the rapid. Because this drop is all in the approach, I study the approach. I study it hard. You go too far left or too far right and there’s a good chance you’re going into a mongo hydraulic where a violent recirculation awaits. If you paddle through the approach waves and keep the angle, hitting the drop in the sweet spot, things can’t go too wrong. It’s a Class III move, I tell myself, staring at it. A Class III move with Class V consequences.</p>
<p>I don’t remember a whole lot from the six weeks I worked that Gauley season in 1991, but I remember that my line at Iron Ring in that beat-up, old Kevlar We-No-Nah Edge was clean. I recall as well seeing a friend who had also come up from the Chattooga to guide here for the first time. Because he worked for a different company, I only saw him one time and that was at Iron Ring when his raft dropped into the hole at the bottom and flipped quickly and violently upstream, depositing Jack and his six customers into the maelstrom. It took a few recirculations, but everyone emerged alive, unscathed. The raft stayed in the hole for a full five minutes, which doesn’t seem like a long time but is.</p>
<p>I remember other things, but they are not important now. What matters is getting back in my boat and running this drop. I swill the last of a Monster Energy Drink, the uncarbonated version, slide a fine chunk of driftwood &#8212; a keepsake for my kids&#8211; in the boat, and saddle up. My commute to work on Interstate 81, I remind myself, is way more dangerous than paddling through this rapid.</p>
<p>Phil, smooth as ever, approaches and then disappears over the hump. I paddle in. Things are good, the approach accurate. I’m in the steep section now, dropping fast. The acceleration is fine but abstract. And then at the bottom, in some wavy, wildy aerated water, just as I lose balance, things slow down. I notice Phil and a few other boaters in an eddy not far to my right. I notice a sycamore tree, a few of its leaves brown. There’s the wet face of a boulder rectangular and dark.</p>
<p>My first roll attempt is hasty and bad; I lift my head, which blows it, but I get a lungful of air. I take my time, set up well for the next roll. Upright again, but loose in my saddle, I drop sideways over a little pourover. Phil’s hooting. Others are hooting. A great noise of water being broken by great boulders. I’m tense, panicky. My flip this time even slower. The word charc comes to mind, how I have bad charc right now, how I’m not seeing my moves through to the finish. Again I set up to roll but pull my skirt instead.</p>
<p>When you swim from your boat in whitewater, you want to hold on to your paddle and your boat. You want your body to be intact. Your checking account doesn’t matter now, nor the level in your gas gauge, nor your family’s health, nor the state of your love life, the body politic, or the planet. You want a good breath. You want to scan ahead for features that might be dangerous and adjust accordingly. You want good charc, you want to see what you’re going to do and start doing it right now just the way you see it.</p>
<p>Body intact, feet downstream, paddle in hand, I’m drifting in some slack water behind that little pourover. I see my boat rushing with the main channel downstream. It seems to have fled, as if disgusted with me for abandoning it. I see Phil and anonymous kayaker give my boat chase. Thank you, Phil, I think. Thank you, Anonymous Kayaker. The bank isn’t far, ten feet or so. I turn on my belly and stroke for it.</p>
<p>It feels mighty good to be standing on the Pennsylvanian sandstone; of course, if it was quartzite or gneiss, it’d feel just as good. The fact is I’m feeling more settled now than I have all day. It’s good to swim from your boat sometimes. I don’t swim that often. I don’t paddle rivers with volume like the Gauley too often, mostly the local creeks and other, local class III/IV water. Part of the reason I came over here today, I think, was to risk a swim. Consider it done, that risk and that swim, anyway.</p>
<p>The walk downstream is scrambly. The rain, which pelted furious and thick-dropped a little while ago in the rapids above Pillow Rock, falls easy now. It’s pleasant. The booties I wear have decent grip. I climb and descend and leap and slide down to a big eddy across from Phil, who is on the opposite bank with my boat. Nice work, Phil, I say. He can’t hear me. The river’s swift and bouncy between us. I jump and swim but can’t break through the eddy wall into the current. A boulder slab blocks my view upstream, but I remember a few rafts approaching the staging eddy above Iron Ring as we entered the rapid, including a nice looking crew of old heads from an outfit on the French Broad in North Carolina. One is rarely alone in September on the Gauley. I wave my thumb at Phil, who is still holding a rope, waiting to hit me with it when I swim. He understands, nods. Soon enough a raft approaches, the one I hoped to see. I do the hitchhiker thumb thing and they bite, pick me up, ferry me across. Everything’s dandy. There’s even a Clif Bar still in my boat, as well as the driftwood and a fresh piece of 4mg Cinnamon Surge nicotine gum. Thanks again, Phil.</p>
<p>3.<br />
I’ve savored the mile or so of river we’ve travelled since Iron Ring. There’s a feeling of being more connected with the river and my boat than before the swim, and striating this feeling are currents of confidence and respect. I watch Phil, I watch the river, glance a few times at the sky, the rain soft, diffuse.</p>
<p>Now we can see downstream the cliffs that signal the approach to Sweet’s Falls, the last of the big five and, to me and many others, the simplest and most dramatic. I could describe this rapid in my river rat turned English teacher way, but I like the description from the ACE Adventure Resort website very much – while it’s informational, no-nonsense, and accurate, it’s also delightfully hopped up with river guide’s tangy voice and lingo. I mean, it goes down like a good beer. Try it:</p>
<p>“The last of the Upper Gauley &#8216;s Big Five Class V Rapids is located about ten miles below the dam. The fourteen foot falls were named after John Sweet for his first descent of them in 1968. The broken ledge system that forms this powerful rapid provides some options regarding different lines and also numerous hazards.</p>
<p>The main entrance is on the right side just off of the shore where you will punch through a couple of foamy waves. From there, the current quickly carries you toward the horizon line. Stay away from the shelfy right bank. It is undercut from the entrance of the rapid all the way to the edge of the falls, and the water that washes over the right channel pours onto jagged rocks and sieves through the massive boulders at the bottom. Upon approaching the falls, you will first want to notice the rooster tail spouting mist on the left side of the drop at the bottom of the crease in the horizon line. The roostertail is formed by a rock projecting from the ledge about half way down the drop. It promises to bring a serious attitude adjustment to all who find it, so be wary and remember that the water pushes from right to left as it approaches the ledge.</p>
<p>To the right of the crease, the current builds up onto and over the ledge that forms the falls. At the bottom of this vertical drop is a powerful and shallow recirculating hydraulic. At higher flows (4000+ cfs.), this turns into a terrible pour-over as a great portion of the river water pounds over the ledge instead of pillowing off of it and left into the crease.</p>
<p>The water going over the main part of the drop generally falls from right to left as it pillows off of the higher section of the ledge on the right and into the crease. For the picture perfect line over the falls, you will be searching for the coveted green hump at the top right of the crease from where you will slide down the sloping green tongue and slam into the frothy aerated water at the bottom of the drop. There is a fifteen foot margin of error that separates a successful line from fireworks and flying bodies, so know thy line and execute. Good luck.</p>
<p>The ride&#8217;s not over at the base of the falls as you&#8217;ll immediately have to take some evasive action to avoid the large boulder blocking the left side of the river. The main current rushes directly towards it. It is aptly named Postage Due, because on a busy day it is not uncommon to see rafts stamped onto its upstream face. Those who wash to the left of Postage Due will find themselves in the Box Canyon.”</p>
<p>Punch, carry, project, spout, push, turn, go, search, slide, slope, slam, know, rush, wash, be – the verbs in this passage have pop, gradient. “Know thy line” and “coveted green hump” are surprising in mouth and mind too. Some might claim the writer neglects a few factoids, such as:<br />
1. The rock that forms the roostertail is called Dildo Rock from the time a raft pinned on it, wrapping the rock like a condom.<br />
2. There are massive rock walls beginning over a hundred yards above the drop in the approach and these cliffs continue beyond the drop.<br />
3. During Gauley season, from these cliffs and from boulders just downstream of the base of the falls, spectators drinking beer and eating barbeque eagerly await your entertainment.<br />
4. Carnage is the best entertainment.</p>
<p>Phil is talking Sweet’s as well, shouting, really, so I can hear him over the wave noise. We’re eddied under the cliffs on river right well above another eddy we’ll catch, the final one before we drop the falls. He’s patiently answering my question, which was a big one, requiring the kind of knowledge that among the open canoe wizards that I know only the Furtrapper can provide. I asked him this: Why does this rapid look so different from the others? Why the coliseum feel to it?</p>
<p>It’s a bedrock rapid instead of a boulder garden, Phil says. I nod. He goes on. Sweets, as we see it today – and I’m theorizing here &#8212; is in many ways a young and very dynamic rapid within the Upper Gauley reach. I nod again. He notices, keeps on. See, all these Gauley rapids are a product of downcutting within the entire New/Kanawha system, and this downcutting is spreading upstream from the Ohio River. The downcutting occurs in waves which sweep upstream through channels. Bedrock rapids indicate the position of such a wave, and &#8212; I think, anyway &#8212; boulder rapids indicate areas through which a wave has recently passed, steepening the slopes to induce landslides into the river.</p>
<p>Phil smiles a little when he talks. I don’t know if it’s intentional, but his grin – the near grimace of someone focusing, finding a home in his focus &#8212; makes me listen more intently as though I might catch a few sparks, learn what he’s saying through my body, some fire there, as well as through the words.</p>
<p>That make any sense? he asks.</p>
<p>A lot of it, I say, makes sense. But those waves you mention, we’re riding one now, right, a long one?</p>
<p>Yes sir, Phil says, smiling full on now. A real long wave, eons long. Now keep in mind, he says, that Sweet’s itself isn&#8217;t the only expression of this wave of downcutting. We’ve seen it through the general gradient increase from Lost Paddle down, where more and more bedrock has been present in the streambed until now. Sweet’s is a ledge with cliffs, a few boulders, for sure, but it&#8217;s not a boulder pile like Pillow and Iron Ring and the others. These coliseum walls have only recently been cut back and steepened. They’ve yet to have time to collapse fully and make a big boulder pile.</p>
<p>Phil pauses to look over his shoulder now. Another guy in a kayak has drifted in our vicinity. He’s been eavesdropping and staring at Phil’s bizarrely accessorized helmet, but now he peels out of the eddy and enters the first waves of the approach rapid. We watch him, those fluid negotiations, until with sudden velocity (simultaneous with some cave collapsing in my stomach), he disappears over the lip of the drop.</p>
<p>Phil looks at me. Is the light blinking? he asks, hand moving from helmet-mounted camera back to his paddle.</p>
<p>It takes a moment to see the light blink. Yes, I tell him.</p>
<p>He nods, starts a stroke. That was probably more than you wanted to know, Phil says as he carves out of the eddy.</p>
<p>It was right on, I tell him, and then I turn and, following, take one last look at the whole rapid, the good line from right to left through the waves, that sweet spot at the lip of the drop, the places in the runout to be avoided.</p>
<p>We’re in the current now, the velocity impressive, cliffs nearly cinematic as we buck and splash past them. Let’s see, I think. Let’s see what the river has to say about all this.</p>
<p>Our runs are entertaining, but not so much. There’s no carnage. Phil punches the diagonal hole and graces into the left eddy at the bottom of the falls. I flip at the base but roll up fast, grateful, exhilarated, and then grimace through the next moves. I’m fatigued. Things feel strange, suddenly, very populated. In boats, out of boats, there are people everywhere. The boulders appear decorated as if with patchwork quilts of synthetic colors, spilled Skittles, all the boats pulled up, parked, along with paddles, helmets, lifejackets &#8212; the gear-clad revelers, reverencers. Plastic, rubber, nylon, neoprene. People hoot and holler, talk. Smells of grilling meat. Smells of marijuana, beer, water breaking against boulders, against more water. My bum shoulder stings a bit, but I finagle around Box Canyon and Postage Due, that rectangular boulder in the river’s gut, and stroke into an eddy with a view. Here I drift – Phil, too &#8212; watching a procession of rafts and hardboats approach and drop Sweet’s. It’s hypnotic, the whole scene.</p>
<p>I’ve never liked the term adrenaline junkie. It’s cute for a second but quickly does little in the way of honoring its subject. That pop-science terms stunt the imagination is nothing new. Those of us on the Gauley today, we’re not here simply for that vague concept of an endorphin rush, even if some speak of it. We’re here to be challenged, for sure, and to practice the pleasures of expectation, strategy, chance, doubt, wreckage, and fulfillment that go along with any demanding and risky physical activity involving gravity and the elements.</p>
<p>I believe there’s a thing even more squirrely at the heart of our exploring the Gauley today. One might call it the nature of nature, most micro of microeddies, one that’s caught, if ever, sidelong, with a glimpse, a glance that remains, somehow, forever embedded. Best not to call it anything at all, but to take strokes in its general direction. We’re here to see and feel a river, touch and be touched by it, to know this place in ways beneath knowing, beyond knowing. From its bed to its banks to its headwaters, to its history across time, from waves of human settlement back into deep time’s waves, the Gauley, like all rivers and streams, contains worlds, worlds of wild complexity and nuance.</p>
<p>We’re here to be physically reminded of something, something like the soul of a place and the soul of our minds, the oversoul and undersoul and that between, within, shot through by land, blood, time. And by paddling with friends, with strangers, with strangers becoming friends, by spending time watching and studying each other, seeing how we interpret the river through the motions we make in or, rather, with our boats, that interplay of drift and attack, planning and abandon, makes this experience even stronger, more tensile, kind of intersoulular. In word and flesh, Phil has brought me closer to this river, to all running water, and to myself. Though I never met Frankie Hubbard and saw him paddle a canoe only once, I sense that he is with us, too, and has helped us through his design of the boat that both Phil and the river have worn in strange, beautiful ways.</p>
<p>No matter where in the spectrum &#8212; tempestuous to slack, flooded to bed-exposed, mountainous to tidal, dam-altered to free-flowing, polluted to pristine, industrial to post-industrial – rivers embody the essential and wondrous paradoxes of being in general: they are submissive and doubtless, fragile and durable, restless and restful, threatened and threatening, dangerous and safe; to be in touch with this invites us to be in touch with existence, and those are currents worth knowing.</p>
<p>There’s a raft approaching Sweet’s Falls now. They are far too far left, headed for, as ACE writer noted, “fireworks and flying bodies.” The spectator noise builds. I don’t want carnage, I’m spent – good tired &#8212; and want to see and feel clean lines. With a draw stroke, I spin my boat and head downstream to where Phil has gone. He’s surfing a green-glassy wave near the river-right bank. The rain has stopped. The sky seems lighter. The drive home could be colorful. This is rainbow weather. We have a mile of boulder gardens and pools to explore before the take out, Phil and I, and then a steep and slick climb with shouldered boats up along the rhododendron-flanked waterfalls of Mason’s Branch. We’re going to take our time.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>1/<br />
Virginia Woolf begins her 1926 essay, “On Being Ill,” with a doozy of a sentence.</p>
<p>Considering how common illness is, how tremendous the spiritual change that it brings, how astonishing, when the lights of health go down, the undiscovered countries that are then disclosed, what wastes and deserts of the soul a slight attack of influenza brings to view, what precipices and lawns sprinkled with bright flowers a little rise of temperature reveals, what ancient and obdurate oaks are uprooted in us by the act of sickness, how we go down into the pit of death and feel the waters of annihilation close above our heads and wake thinking to find ourselves in the presence of the angels and the harpers when we have a tooth out and come to the surface in the dentist’s arm-chair and confuse his ‘Rinse the mouth—rinse the mouth’ with the greeting of the Deity stooping from the floor of Heaven to welcome us—when we think of this, as we are so frequently forced to think of it, it becomes strange indeed that illness has not taken its place with love and battle and jealousy among the prime themes of literature.</p>
<p>One reason I quote this chunk at length—the paragraph it begins goes on for three pages and contains twenty-one sentences, many heavily semi-coloned—is to behold Woolf’s lapidary craftsmanship. It’s a stunningly stylized lead, rich in Proustian intricacies of phrasal singing and delayed cadence. Its craft echoes the essay’s point: she probably wrote this piece only after she recovered. I doubt such a sick person could have shaped such formal lines. It’s further curious that while the writing suggests surviving an illness has been productive—she seems almost caffeinated with getting well—Woolf, nonetheless, doesn’t tell us how bad off she was. Was it the flu, a toothache, a chronic condition, desolation? The insights she claims she has while ill (going to “undiscovered countries,” undergoing “spiritual changes”) seem dependent on the severity of the illness she bore (“how we go down to the pit of death and feel the waters of annihilation over our heads”).</p>
<p>Throughout her six decades, Woolf’s ailment was depression, which, in her diaries, she calls the “glooms.” Depression kept her from writing and socializing; the pain structured her “amphibious life,” half in, half out of bed. (As everyone knows, to escape its torturous cycle, Woolf drowned herself in 1941.) And yet even the “glooms,” once outlasted, were material to the novelists. In her diary she says, “These curious intervals in life—I’ve had many—are the most fruitful artistically—one becomes fertilized.” Her diary records then that the “best of these illnesses is that they loosen the earth about the roots.” In fact, in 1926, the time of “On Being Ill,” she was at work on <em>To the Lighthouse</em>, perhaps the closet peer to her finest work, <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em>.</p>
<p>Most, if not all, of Woolf’s essay analyzes her illness and—counter to her core idea—<em>avoids</em> a physical description of whatever ache has brought her to the writing. One reason, she states, is that the sick are too short-tempered to read or write prose: “Illness makes us disinclined for the long campaigns that prose exacts.” Another way to put it—if laid low, we (writers) can’t essay about our ailing self because we don’t feel good enough <em>to</em> write. Feeling well in the body (a redundancy, I know) makes our minds work; mental effort, on its own, cannot make an illness subside. The circumlocution makes a kind of sense. It’s only when we’re well that we chart the descent we have climbed out of. The brightest insight, then, is that Woolf doesn’t know why literature has shunned disease—and its sensate actuality—so completely. But knowing this is true is what engages her. “The merest school girl,” she notes, “when she falls in love, has Shakespeare or Keats to speak her mind for her; but let a sufferer try to describe a pain in his head to a doctor and language at once runs dry.”</p>
<p>A rigorous essayist, Woolf fleshes out every nuance of this point (her style might be termed an enraptured discursive wandering, cavorting as analysis), namely, that we are not drawn to make art of, or while, we wallow in misery. Excepting nineteenth-century ill souls like Dostoevsky’s Raskolnikov and Hardy’s grotesque boy, Father Time, literature and illness are close but unpartnered. Literature can’t cope with disease as a “prime theme.” The lacuna may be why she and other modernists pinnacled the stream-of-consciousness technique—to intimate a mentally or physically sick person’s woe via the muddle of one’s thoughts. Such was presented in the paranoid delusions of the suicidal ex-soldier, Septimus Warren Smith, in <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em>. But the essayist’s technique (at least, Woolf’s and her tradition) was reserved for thinking <em>about</em> its subject. One’s anguish is not embodied; it is reflected—more, reflected upon. Woolf marks this while pondering Proust: “Literature does its best to maintain that its concern is with the mind.”</p>
<p>2/<br />
Such maintenance, Woolf argues, exemplifies the healthy mind, in which “our intelligence domineers over our senses.” As she says, we seem to write (or our literary tradition tells us to write), “always of the doings of the mind; the thoughts that come into it.” And, of course, such doings are more rationally constructed than wildly thrown up in literature. Emotions may be dramatized, but they are rarely as meaningful as reason is to a character. Physical health is one-dimensional. Anyone who has read the undisciplined artistic jottings among the mentally ill, whose damaged minds have taken over their rationality, knows this. What’s more, even though Woolf’s or Proust’s or David Foster Wallace’s sentences have palpable effects on us, language keeps the thinking apparatus going, using sensate experience merely as a context for the vagaries of one’s thought. (I find it fascinating that these three writers were depressives, their long bouts of suffering seeding their work.) Still, sickness doesn’t quite give us the <em>words</em> for sickness. But being ill helps us portray the gap between body and mind, between self and shared experience, between what we do and what we don’t want to be. This is Woolf’s essay’s thesis.</p>
<p>We feel good one day, lousy the next; literature doesn’t care what the body experiences day-in and day-out. Such sensations are, in a sense, anti-literary. Let me get at this by comparing our experience of our bodies to our experience of music. In music, its passage is everything, reflecting on it, nothing. In music, we are locked in the present, slave to its ongoingness, seduced by its quotidian drive. We don’t need music to think; we need music to feel. How much anguish and joy, mustiness and light, longing and satisfaction, is <em>borne</em> by a listener in the twenty-eight minutes of Arnold Schoenberg’s <em>Verklärte Nich</em>t? Could it be that the body, and its musical aptitude, shrugged literature off long ago as a source of emotional immediacy? Has literature moved away from speech (the improvised) and into writing (the composed) for better or worse? Has the body preferred music, drama, film, and dance to the page-bound tongue?</p>
<p>The corollary with language is, we need words to shape what we feel in words. Once shaped, words tend to mean more than how they’re said. And yet, ironically, emotion is not excluded from writing—which Woolf the journal-keeper knows well.</p>
<p>Proof that the feeling domain exists is not in Woolf’s essays but in her diary. There, we find her embodying her depression, albeit primitively. Consider this fragmented, literal cry of the “glooms,” from an entry entitled “A State of Mind,” Wednesday 15 September, 1926:</p>
<p>Woke up perhaps at 3. Oh its beginning its coming—the horror—physically like a painful wave swelling about the heart—tossing me up. I’m unhappy unhappy! Down—God, I wish I were dead. Pause. But why am I feeling this? Let me watch the wave rise. I watch. Vanessa [her sister]. Children. Failure. Yes; I detect that Failure failure. (The wave rises). Oh they laughed at my taste in green paint! Wave crashes. I wish I were dead! I’ve only a few years to live I hope. I cant face this horror any more—(this is the wave spreading out over me).</p>
<p>What a contrast to the operatic opening of “On Being Ill.” From essay to diary, we have the former, highly literary and literate, and the latter, definitely not that—not with its repeated words, its clumsy syntax, its overdramatic exclamations, its indulgent whining. Such is not what we’re accustomed to from the female genius of Bloomsbury. Can it be this simple, this overt: the essay/the novel perform a literature of the mind while the diary/letter/journal engage a language of the body? The sufferer in the diary (I’m certain Woolf would agree) has no equivalent voice in the essay. Different sports entirely. It’s almost shocking to hear Woolf’s messy complaints in her diary: she is upset, stymied, histrionic. <em>No, don’t go back to work. You’ll sound crazy. Wait until you’re well</em>. Mere worry is uncomely, unshaped, compared to the essay’s burnish. Yet what I love about the diary’s rawness is how it reduces our comeliness, our shapeliness, our burnishing. The diary invites in the person the essay rejects.</p>
<p>3/<br />
How do we make sense of language’s expression of the body (Woolf’s diary) and literature’s avoidance of the body (Woolf’s essay)? What I think she is suggesting in “On Being Ill” is that the glooms she undergoes do not translate to experiences she has, or would like to have, <em>as a writer</em>. Woolf would like to sing of being sick but, instead, she invents a short symphony about literature’s missed effort—hers included—to embody illness. She shows us that a literature of those living with cancer, heart disease, or profound loss is possible. It’s just that she’s not the writer who will accomplish it.</p>
<p>Let me suggest a few reasons why I think she’s <em>not</em> the one. First, Woolf tells us as much in her essay. She identifies herself as a woman of “English birth,” and, thus, cannot, perhaps will not, like her contemporaries, “take liberties with the language” and mimic the infection that’s laid her low. (She suggests that American writers, freed from Brit-Lit conventions, might take such liberties.) Were she to do so, Woolf says, she must find “a new language,” “more primitive, more sensual, more obscene” than the style she writes in, often, in homage, to the essays of Hazlitt, Arnold, and Beerbohm. Second, she realizes there’s “a childish outspokenness in illness,” but she cannot resort to such childish, diary-like phrasing herself. Even though health is “the genial pretence” of civilization, Woolf is not game enough (she is in her fiction) to wield the possibilities that sickness offers the writer. For example, when she notes that “lying recumbent, staring straight up, the sky is discovered to be something so different from this that really it is a little shocking,” she seems content with the self-indulgence. Bed-rest is a respite from writing, not a new subject. And third, such uncertainty about her illness pushes Woolf to re-elevate the style, to remind herself and her readers that artful writers avoid the poor-me complaints anguish and pain force us into. An illness’s value is fleeting. Its “rashness” is momentary, when, she says, we disregard what the critics have said about Shakespeare, and, nursing a temperature, are left with “nothing but Shakespeare and oneself.” If only we could read Shakespeare during our a bout of influenza or diphtheria, how abnormal he might sound!</p>
<p>Any new writing whose untrod expanse sickness might unleash remains untrod in Woolf. By choice, by character, by a lifetime spent perfecting her style. This inherent reticence with the essay is echoed by her most capacious biographer, Hermione Lee, who notes in her essay on Woolf’s essays: “Woolf does not speak about herself directly. She never refers to herself in her essays as a novelist, or to her life as Virginia Woolf, or to her personal relations with anyone she is writing about. She speaks from the ground of the literary, the historical, and the cultural, not the personal. Yet her character, her experience and her voice come very close to us.”</p>
<p>I get this closeness; it’s why I, too, continue to read her. But we’re still left with literature’s neglect of the ill body. It also reminds us that the literature of Woolf’s era was far less modern than we think. Its practices remained puritanical, chastened, stultifying, despite many eminent novels and poems before Woolf, Pound, Joyce, and Eliot. Woolf upholds the essay’s long tradition of pedastaling the dispassionate observer. From Isaac Newton to E. M. Forster, the English essay corralled only its worldly subject—remaining above it all, resisting any descent into the inner self of the essayist. In the phenomenal formal gold Woolf mined in her novels, it seems she found no outlet in nonfiction to massage or manage <em>her</em> illness.</p>
<p>4/<br />
Fifty-two years later, such restraint is echoed in Susan Sontag who, in writing about illness, also leaves a personal sickness unmentioned, especially in her eloquently distant <em>Illness as Metaphor</em> (1978). Sontag’s treatise surveys how literature for the last two centuries has misrepresented humankind’s most dreaded diseases, cancer and tuberculosis, subjects and their treatment Woolf had missed. Sontag begins by declaring that she rejects self-involvement. “I want to describe,” she confesses in the second paragraph, “not what it is really like to emigrate to the kingdom of the ill and live there, but the punitive or sentimental fantasies concocted about that situation.” Her goal is, she says, to “elucidate” this metaphoric way of thinking and to “liberate” us from it. In other words, the representation of “what [disease] is really like” is, for her, more telling than “what it is really like” to “live” with a disease. By “more telling” I mean Sontag’s advocacy: We have to see the bars of the cage that surround us before we, and our culture, know how to break free.</p>
<p>In 1976, Sontag had a mastectomy and chemotherapy for breast cancer. As a survivor, she characterizes her struggle with the disease has been far more literary than physical. (If ever one might contract a “literary illness,” Sontag did.) With her treatments, she no doubt endured terrible pain. But the literary outcome of such a sickness, dramatic or reflective, recall Woolf’s—it’s unrecorded. Instead, Sontag is devoted to her reading, which echoes the life she has always led with or without cancer.</p>
<p>It’s not until our time—and the age of pathography, a virulent subset of memoir—that sick, wounded, diseased, bereaved, and even dying authors are revealing how their conditions have disoriented them as they essay and narrate those conditions via new forms of personal writing, forms which feel much different from what has come before. Notwithstanding Woolf’s and Sontag’s grand analyses, very few writers sidle up to the subject of illness essayistically these days. Instead, they (we) write pathography.</p>
<p>Pathography is a term Joyce Carol Oates used in a 1988 review to lament biographies whose authors overemphasize the decadent, sordid, or disordered traits of their subjects’ lives. Since then, the term has been appropriated to typify any writing heavily soiled by grief or loss. Unfortunately, pathography substitutes now for almost any illness memoir, in part, since memoir, by authors and critics, is too easily reduced to the self in turmoil, rarely in wonder, in love, in art. And yet, writing about (or, if you like, authoring) one’s disease has value because the sick-to-well author lingers, at times overlong, on the underside. My view is that narratives of personal illness and tragedy are worthy when they challenge those nagging exclusionary clauses that literature has always traded in.</p>
<p>5/<br />
A brilliant instance of the contemporary illness memoir is <em>The Two Kinds of Decay</em> (2008) by Sarah Manguso. In it, the writer lays out almost mechanically the stages of her autoimmune blood disease, some nine years spent enduring transfusions, paralysis, and depression. “I resisted as long as I could,” she notes of her delay in starting the book. “A narrator must keep a safe distance from the story, but a lyric speaker must occupy the lyric moment as it’s happening. Or so it seems to me at this moment.” Which is to say Manguso found a form and a voice once she began working her material <em>lyrically</em>. Her confessional voice is both emotionally detached and intimately personal. Such scoring means the story is less plotted, less in the foreground, while moments, often of clinical ill-being, are quickly captured, embraced, hung onto, and let go. The effect has literary and purgative shape.</p>
<p>Each of Manguso’s eighty-one chapters (“Secrets,” “Cured,” “More Medicine”) isolates a moment or a medial idea or a treatment fact or its consequence that the chapter cracks open. Each paragraph, five to ten per chapter, is followed by a space break, Internet style. Each chapter weighs emotionally at least ten pounds. Once the chapter lays out a minimal set of statements or facts, Manguso stops. Often abruptly. Before an emotion and its self-possession overtakes her.</p>
<p>For example, in “Walking,” Manguso describes her failure at trying to move on her own, even with crutches. Here’s about twenty percent of the chapter:</p>
<p>I wasn’t safely mobile on the crutches. I shouldn’t have gone back to school. My doctors were doing the best they could, but they must have been delusional to think it was safe to let me go back to Cambridge [Harvard] without a wheelchair. I was still poisoning myself a little more with every beat of my heart, barely able to manipulate my crutches, just waiting until I wasn’t able to manipulate the crutches at all.</p>
<p>In the end, walking is too difficult to manage, so she is literally carried in and out of classes. To her (obvious) chagrin. And on that beat—like a good poem—the chapter’s over. Sentiment resisted. Complaint engaged. There’s a restrictive sensibility at play, which keeps the focus on the problem: her being wasted and trying to walk. When she writes, “I was still poisoning myself a little more with every beat of my heart,” Manguso reminds us that her disease continues no matter what she does. It’s more than chronic; it’s <em>her</em>. Like Woolf’s cerebral intimacy, it’s curious how this flat affect adds up to our feeling it. One key to getting readers to feel is to put the feeling off-center: lessening the drama heightens the drama.</p>
<p>Such a tack is an effective distillation, a long exhalation. Brevity, statement, and word choice balance one another and deliver each chapter’s singularity. We get it. We breathe in sync with Manguso. We sit with her and we move on. A long illness<em> is</em> its day-by-day tedium. How regularly her treatments for the blood disease hurt <em>and</em> fail. Nine years on, however, she does get well. Maybe the bittersweet arrival of wellness eventually allows her to craft just the right spread of emotion, which, in turn, turns back the sentimentality Woolf and Sontag so feared they would indulge.</p>
<p>6/<br />
The grandparent of the contemporary illness memoir is <em>Girl, Interrupted</em> (1993) by Susanna Kaysen. The book charts her psychiatric breakdown for which, at eighteen, she was forcibly detained at Boston’s McLean hospital. The book is highly original in its fragmentary nature, its accusatory tone, and the reproduction of her actual files, albeit partly redacted. Kaysen reframes her condition to be as much rebellion as psychological illness—part severe depression, part self-inflicted pain, part adolescent immaturity, part “compulsive promiscuity” (a diagnosis), part parental and institutional overreaction, part 1960s high-school anti-establishment madness and/or flirtation with madness. The fact that she recovers from her ordeal makes a reader wonder at the efficacy of McLean’s treatment programs let alone why she was committed in the first place. The memoir’s brilliance, written in flurries of miniature narratives, almost like a flip book, is that the collaged style authenticates, even mimics, her year-and-a-half incarceration and its crazy-making rituals.</p>
<p>And then there’s the explosion of emotion in the recent <em>Blue Nights</em> (2011) by Joan Didion. What is so striking in this confession about the death of her daughter Quintana is how maniacally present Didion’s inner world has become in her writing. Of her three memoirs, this one is most locked in the burdensome now, where bereavement will not pass. The writing is near diary-like in its unadorned directness. Losing her daughter and the author’s regret occupy past and present simultaneously: the past <em>is</em> the present. The prose is often lodged in—or devolves to—statement. Much is declarative, much is echoed, much is harbored, much is, like Manguso, entrancingly flat. It’s the curse of being pinned, post-death, to the endlessness of every day as a day without Quintana. Set in the rocking chair, a good deal of <em>Blue Nights</em> wallows in what if’s. On occasion Didion gets the ice-flow moving. But it’s quickly halted and re-directed to lingering on what’s missing. In a peculiar way, the book may be over-felt, a trait I would have never thought Joan Didion capable of.</p>
<p><em>This was never supposed to happen to her</em>, I remember thinking—outraged, as if she and I had been promised a special exemption—in the third of those intensive care units.</p>
<p>By the time she reached the fourth I was no longer invoking this special exemption.</p>
<p><em>When we talk about mortality we are talking about our children.</em></p>
<p>I just said that, but what does it mean?</p>
<p>All right, of course I can track it, of course you can track it, another way of acknowledging that our children are hostages to fortune, but when we talk about our children what are we saying? Are we saying what it meant to us to have them? What it meant to us not to have them? What it meant to let them go? Are we talking about the enigma of pledging ourselves to protect the unprotectable? About the whole puzzle of being a parent?</p>
<p><em>Time passes</em>.</p>
<p>Yes, agreed, a banality, of course time passes.</p>
<p>Then why do I say it, why have I already said it more than once?</p>
<p>Have I been saying it the same way I say I have lived most of my life in California?</p>
<p>Have I been saying it without hearing what I say?</p>
<p>Could it be that I heard it more this way: <em>Time passes, but not so aggressively that anyone notices?</em> Or even: <em>Time passes, but not for me</em>? Could it be that I did not figure in either the general nature or the permanence of the slowing, the irreversible changes in mind and body, the way in which you wake one summer morning less resilient than you were and by Christmas find your ability to mobilize gone, atrophied, no longer extant? The way in which you live most of your life in California, and then you don’t? The way in which your awareness of this passing time—this permanent slowing, this vanishing resilience—multiplies, metastasizes, becomes your very life?</p>
<p>This—Didion’s self-questioning bravura, her avowals undercut by doubt, her slippage from clock to psychological time—feels in Didion’s traditional style but also hewn to the core emotional facts. The self-questioning is chilling. I think this tack may be what Virginia Woolf dreamed of. Had the culture permitted her directness with illness in the essay, she might have used some of her artless diary, letter, and journal entries to enhance her work. The value of the contemporary memoir lies in its having evolved to allow in to literary writing the varying and competing voices of diary, essay, narrative, journal, letter, even email. The literary, the non-literary, cohabit. A new form, indeed. <em>Right now my stomach hurts a great deal, which means I must be direct as I write, though it’s also an occasion to wonder why it’s so hard to get this suffering into words when the pain is this bad.</em></p>
<p>7/<br />
The essays of Woolf and Sontag remind us that the ill body is <em>persona non grata</em> in traditional literature. (In literature’s evolving definition, we must include its many-eras’ avoidance of the personal.) The memoirs of Manguso, Kaysen, and Didion (and hundreds of other pathographers like Nancy Mairs, Bonnie J. Rough, Jean-Dominique Bauby, Joshua Cody) prove that one’s disease or loss are literarily worthwhile because authors are commingling personal data with the stylistic possibilities of prose. In spite of that surge, it—memoir as literature—is still an irksome, backwards-leaning notion. What I’m reminded of, as we transition to a transliterate culture, is that we may no longer need the “L” word. This echoes something Harold Brodkey stirs up in <em>This Wild Darkness: The Story of My Death</em>: “One may be tired of the world—tired of the prayer-makers, the poem-makers, whose rituals are distracting and human and pleasant but worse than irritating because they have no reality—while reality itself remains very dear.”</p>
<p>In Brodkey, you can hear an ill man’s “irritation” with the succor of artists and their languages while life offers what prayer and poem cannot: the <em>dearness</em> of “reality itself.” Literature, the thing we often seek when the real becomes unbearable, is useless when actual illness rears its head, useless when we need, or may want, to bear our end.  Another, non-literary writing must take its place. The irony is that as literature-making creatures, we can’t help but want writing to be part of that end—albeit a lousy representation of, or besotted substitute for, reality. Imagining death in a novel, for examples, may be useful to the person who’s <em>not dying</em>. It may prepare us, get us to feel the inevitable <em>prior</em> to its arrival. How I will perform when my time comes a good novel may help me understand. But to the chronically ill, those in treatment, the terminal, literature gives scant relief. As Brodkey recognized on his deathbed, the literary is a distraction to keep the mind off the end. Which, I suppose, can’t be helped. The closer we are to dying, the more precious are life’s distractions. Is there any way, other than a coma, <em>not</em> to be alive while dying?</p>
<p>Does a memoir’s hand-wringing get us any closer to a qualitative expression of illness? I’m pursuing that in my own work, in the work other writers, and in our literary canon. Perhaps the memoir is charting a new course, built of immediacy, lyricism, concentration, and bald emotionality. However, it seems a body’s ailment must remain unvoiced, prey to a kind of entropy that accompanies any sustained inwardness. Like depression. Like dying. Can <em>any</em> literary form get the pain out? I wonder. The language of life is its literary unspokenness. Therein lies its draw for the writer. To be outspoken about what’s unspoken.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last fall when reports of the encampment in Zuccotti Park first appeared in the newspapers, I thought of Bartleby.  I had been thinking of him for a while.  I had been seeing Bartleby-like figures, forlorn and silent, wandering the halls of the nursing home where a friend was dying.  No one interfered with these quiet residents who existed on the periphery of the community.  No one talked to them or seemed to think of them as human.  It seemed to me that those who failed to recognize the humanity of these wraithlike men and women also failed to recognize their own.  The news of the occupation of Zuccotti Park by humans seeking recognition seemed a chink of light in the ghostly darkness.</p>
<p>In the nineteenth century, before Xerox or electronic printing, important documents were copied by hand.  The original Bartleby, in Herman Melville’s story <em>Bartleby, the Scrivener:</em> <em> A Story of Wall-Street</em>, is a copyist, or scrivener, in the offices of a Wall Street lawyer whose business it is to keep legal order in the financial affairs of his wealthy patrons.  This lawyer is the narrator of Bartleby’s story.  He describes himself as a safe and prudent man, proud to have been employed by John Jacob Astor, whose name, he says, “hath a rounded and orbicular sound to it, and rings like unto bullion.”  Bartleby is the strangest scrivener he’s ever seen.</p>
<p>In answer to an ad, Bartleby appears at the narrator’s office door, “pallidly neat, pitiably respectable, and incurably forlorn.”  At first he does a great deal of copying, as if he had been “famished” for something to write.  He sits behind a screen, close to a window that looks out on a blank wall.  One day the narrator summons him to check his copy with the other scriveners, and from behind his green screen, Bartleby declares, “I would prefer not to.”</p>
<p>Later, when asked to stop by the Post Office, Bartleby again announces that he prefers not to.  He prefers not do any errands.  Eventually, he prefers not to do any copying.  One Sunday, the narrator discovers that Bartleby has been living in his offices, but, though he no longer does any work,   he prefers, also, not to vacate the premises.  Bartleby has occupied Wall Street.</p>
<p>Bartleby’s story is a story of Wall Street, that is, of the walls that form the edifice of nineteenth century capitalism.  The narrator calls himself a man of assumptions.  He means he assumes everyone else accepts his assumptions.  Though he doesn’t suspect there are alternatives, he accepts the values of Wall Street.  For him, John Jacob Astor, slum landlord, is a model of respectability.  Orderly and safe, on Wall Street, respectability means climbing to the top of the financial heap.</p>
<p>But for Bartleby, Wall Street means the blank wall his window looks out onto.  While Wall Street assumes that competition according to the rules leads to success,   for Bartleby this assumption means merely copying.  Bartleby is not a man of assumptions, but a man of preferences.  No one else in this story of law and Wall Street has clear preferences with regard to human life beyond the assumptions of Wall Street.</p>
<p>Melville published <em>Bartleby</em> in 1853, nearly a hundred and sixty years before the events at Zuccotti Park.  The present Occupation of Wall Street has sparked a larger movement in which thousands of people, who when they had work and a place to live accepted the assumptions of Wall Street, have now declared themselves the 99% who do not benefit from those assumptions and who would therefore prefer not to participate in the safe and orderly system that has spewed them out.  And so they too have taken up residence on Wall Street—on Wall Street and in public spaces in cities throughout this country and in other countries as well.  When they are dispersed, they insist they are, in some sense, not going anyplace.</p>
<p>Of the characters in Melville’s story, only Bartleby (and Wall Street) have names.  The narrator is nameless.  His three clerks have nicknames:  Turkey, Nippers, and Ginger Nut.  The elderly and shabby Turkey is an alcoholic, no doubt his way of adjusting to what is required of him.  Nippers, in spite of his nickname, is not an alcoholic, but without that anodyne, suffers from indigestion and discontent.  The narrator interprets Nippers’ discontent as ambition and approves of his gentlemanly deportment.  Ginger Nut is twelve years old and has been apprenticed to the narrator in order to learn to better himself.  He runs errands.</p>
<p>In the nineteenth century, people who did not benefit from the assumptions of Wall Street sometimes rioted.  In the twentieth century, the labor movement organized unions of working people who came together in strike actions and passive resistance.  In the twenty-first century, we have the internet and social networking, and people come together to protest…in Egypt, in Libya, in Syria, on Wall Street.  Perhaps the assumption among many who read about these revolutionary demonstrations is that the 99% want a fairer share of what the 1% controls.  Bartleby’s passive resistance is entirely solitary.  And the question of what he wants remains an enigma.</p>
<p>The narrator seems not without compassion.  He tolerates Bartleby’s behavior as he tolerates Turkey’s drinking and Nippers’ bad temper.  Among his fellow lawyers, he is embarrassed by Bartleby’s strange presence and by his own tolerance of it.  He offers Bartleby money to relocate.  In desperation, he invites Bartleby to live with him.  Bartleby prefers not to make any change in his living arrangements.  Finally, the narrator moves his offices and leaves Bartleby living in the stairwell.  He is not without compassion,   but for all his sympathy, Bartleby’s preferences are beyond his understanding.</p>
<p>Melville’s story has evoked a similar bewilderment among readers.  A former student of mine,   a non-traditional,   older student,   who had been through tough times and was trying to start his life anew,   took pains to identify with the narrator.  He, also,     he wanted me to know, was a reasonable but compassionate man.  He, too, would try to help Bartleby,   but he knew the limits of his own effectiveness.  Bartleby’s behavior was so seriously inappropriate,   no doubt he needed psychiatric help.</p>
<p>This view of Bartleby is not entirely uncommon among scholars of American Literature.  There is a long list of papers devoted to Bartleby’s clinical profile.  That Bartleby was depressed is not difficult to see, but what did Melville have in mind when he created this melancholy portrait?  Is Bartleby an aberration or is he somehow representative?  Is Melville simply presenting us with an amusing blank wall, or is there something we might learn from Bartleby’s story?  Another student, a nurse in her fifties, whose own life had been very difficult and who thought of herself as Wonder Woman,   had no patience at all with Bartleby’s preferences.  Her advice was to put him on Prozac and tell him to get on with it.</p>
<p>In Melville’s story, we see Bartleby only from the narrator’s point of view.  If we pay close attention, though,   we may see the narrator from Melville’s point of view.  Melville is writing in the mid-nineteenth century,    at a critical moment in the discussion of national ideals.  He is a witness to the burgeoning of industrialism, with attendant questions about slavery.  One interpretation of Bartleby’s story is that it is about the writer’s dilemma in an age of capitalism and conformity.  Melville’s first novels,<em> Typee</em> and <em>Omoo</em>, both tales of the South Seas, had been popular successes, but neither<em> Moby-Dick</em>, published in 1851, nor <em>Pierre</em>, published in 1852, had met with approbation in the literary world.  According to this reading, Bartleby is Melville’s response to this lack of interest in his original work.  It is his declaration that he prefers not to be a copyist.</p>
<p>Yet this is the period of the flowering of classic American Literature.  Melville is writing during what we now call the American Renaissance.  Emerson and the Transcendentalists, Hawthorne, even Emily Dickinson are near, if also solitary, neighbors.  Thoreau’s <em>Walden</em> was published in 1854, Whitman’s <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1855.  The great works of this time and place all address the question of what values America will espouse and all are written from outside the arena of commercial success. While it is no doubt true that Melville suffered from the insensitivity of the public’s response to his mature work (and also that he was not as sanguine about it as Thoreau, who boasted he had a library of nine hundred books,   seven hundred of which he had written himself), as an artist he is looking more and more deeply and more dispassionately.  Surely, the questions he poses are larger than questions of celebrity and literary recognition.</p>
<p>As I write, New York police are once again clearing Zuccotti Park.  This time,   protestors are celebrating the six month anniversary of the first occupation of Wall Street.  “We are the 99%,” they chant.  “Take back government from the corporations!  1-2-3-4, we declare class war!”  It is hard to imagine the cadaverous Bartleby among these demonstrators.  And somehow,   though Melville wrote about the Lowell paper mills and Thoreau spent a night in jail for refusing to pay his poll tax,    I’m not sure I hear their voices, either, among the throng demanding economic justice.</p>
<p>When he was arrested, Thoreau was living at Walden Pond   He had gone into town to see the cobbler about a pair of shoes.  Writing about the experience in <em>Civil Disobedience</em>,  he defines the responsibility of a citizen in a democracy,  not as accepting the decision of a majority (less than 99%),  but as acting according to a faculty he calls Conscience.  Thoreau’s conscience will not allow him to “recognize,” he says, “that political organization as my government which is the slave’s government also.”</p>
<p>As for class warfare, one cannot imagine that spark igniting in Bartleby’s story, though there is a sort of working man’s solidarity among the other three clerks in the office and an awareness of fair labor practices in Nipper’s resentment at having to do Bartleby’s work without pay.  But on the whole, everyone except Bartleby accepts the assumptions of Wall Street;   conscience seems to be a communal effort, determined by those assumptions.  The narrator, in fact, acknowledges in his happiest moments that his charitable treatment of Bartleby provides “a sweet morsel” for what he thinks of as his conscience.</p>
<p>Even so, increasingly,   Bartleby’s passive resistance unnerves the narrator, who comes to doubt the virtue of his position and turns to his other clerks for validation.  That they all assure him he’s right makes little difference except to restore confidence in the normal assumptions.  Bartleby prefers not to be persuaded by their majority, and the others continue to work around his preferences.  This personal insecurity is central to our understanding of the narrator, and it demonstrates, as well, Melville’s understanding of the basis for the competition and conformity that make capitalism possible.  What Bartleby possesses and the narrator lacks is self-knowledge without reference to the judgment of others.  Bartleby, frail as he is, is himself.</p>
<p>Bartleby’s melancholy depresses the narrator.  He catches a glimpse of the falseness of the happiness Wall Street provides.  Even as he observes “the bright silks and sparkling faces…swan-like sailing down the Mississippi of Broadway,” Bartleby’s gloom casts its shadow.  “Ah, happiness courts the light,” says the narrator, “so we deem the world is gay; but misery hides aloof, so we deem that misery there is none.”  When Bartleby first defies him, the narrator says that had there been anything human about Bartleby, he would have tossed him out.  From the point of view of Wall Street, Bartleby is not human, though because of Bartleby, the narrator’s understanding of what is human begins to undergo changes.</p>
<p>The narrator is drawn to Bartleby for reasons he can’t understand.  It is as if he is drawn to something in himself he had not recognized before, something his assumptions haven’t prepared him to face.  Above all, he is horrified by Bartleby’s solitude.  In contrast, for Thoreau at Walden Pond (Walled-In and yet the opposite of Wall Street) solitude is an important part of the project.  Solitude is necessary if one is “to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life.”  It is this fronting the fact,   without the evasions of sentimentality and fashion, that informs Thoreau’s conscience.  No head-in-the-clouds undertaking,  this strenuous exercise in discerning the good and the true,  as if there were something in us that might recognize the good and true,  requires,  not only solitude,  but  faith,  a belief that the cosmos has its reasons,   or that,  at any rate,  we can align ourselves with the cosmos,  that there is some absolute to discover which requires more of us than superficial agreements of the crowd.</p>
<p>Thoreau,   of course, is sauntering all over New England.  His facts are literal as well as spiritual; his faith finds reasons in the shape of a leaf, in language, in a seed.  His attentive solitude and self-reliance touch a world outside himself.  Bartleby is confined to a windowless alcove, or, more accurately, to a window looking at a blank wall.  There is nothing on Wall Street to nourish his humanity, or his soul, as the narrator puts it.  “I might give alms to his body;” he says, “but his body did not pain him; it was his soul that suffered, and his soul I could not reach.”</p>
<p>Is the soul, too, defined by its relation to society?  Bartleby is alone, and on Wall Street it is terrible to be alone.  The narrator is on his way to church, but Bartleby “has disqualified [him]…from church-going.”  There is something in Bartleby, in the soul of Bartleby that has shaken all his belief.  He comes to suspect that Bartleby has been sent to him by Providence, whose purpose, he admits, is beyond his understanding.</p>
<p>In his essay &#8220;Walking,&#8221;   Thoreau says he wants to &#8220;regard man as an inhabitant, or part and parcel of Nature, rather than a member of society.&#8221;  Of course the question is what he means by “society.”  At the Walden cabin, Thoreau had, he said, three chairs, “one for solitude, two for friendship, three for society.”  As for that, surely friendship is a kind of society, though not society as defined by Wall Street.  The book Thoreau actually wrote at Walden, <em>A Week on the Concord and Merrimack River</em>, is a memorial of a trip he took with his brother John in 1839.  The two were close friends.  When John died of tetanus in 1842, Henry grieved deeply.  If Thoreau seems to lack a need for human society,   we might think of his decision to “suck out all the marrow of life” as perhaps connected to the death of his brother.</p>
<p>Still, Thoreau’s obdurate conscience can seem a bit contemptuous of human needs and arrangements, and not only of Wall Street.  His civil disobedience is thoroughgoing.  Sometimes he sounds as if he might belong to the Tea Party.  “That government is best which governs not at all,” he says.  (<em>CD</em> 227)  And, in case we think we have overestimated his self-interest, “I came into this world, not chiefly to make this a good place to live in, but to live in it, be it good or bad.”  (<em>CD</em> 234)</p>
<p>Yet in <em>Walden</em> and <em>Civil Disobedience</em>, Thoreau’s main concern is with how we might live together.  Deliberately, he might say,   we must live together deliberately.  He names the virtues and the necessities.  His declaration of independence includes the material and the spiritual, as if there were no separation.  His economy includes time and eternity.  To live deliberately means to be oneself rather than a copy of someone else.  “If a plant cannot live according to its nature,” he says, “it dies; and so a man.”  (<em>CD</em> 239)  Thoreau would understand Bartleby’s depression.</p>
<p>Thoreau’s sojourn in the woods was an experiment in self-reliance.  That is to say, it was a scientific study, the documentation of which is the book we know as <em>Walden</em>.  This experiment was both personal and political; if Thoreau were to advise men about how they might live, he had first to define himself.  For Thoreau this solitary retreat was a happy interlude.  He was no more bound by Walden than he was by the custom of the town.  He left the woods, having, he said, “several more lives to lead.”  (<em>W</em> 217)</p>
<p>Is such individual independence and self-knowledge possible outside the solitary life, among a community of humans, who are, as they live now, insecure, afraid, competitive?  Even Emerson, whose thought Thoreau made literal, was unwilling when invited, to join the Utopians at Brook Farm.  He declines, he says, echoing Bartleby’s statement of preferences, “to remove from my present prison to a prison a little larger.”</p>
<p>The Occupy Wall Street Movement does not wish to define its goals beyond experimenting with how society might be organized if somehow Wall Street were disempowered.  There is no Utopian vision of how we might live and what we might live for.  I did read a profile in <em>The New Yorker</em> (George Packer, Dec.5, 2011) about a lonely man who found friends and a feeling of belonging when he joined the OWS encampment in New York.  And it is clear that some of the organizers view the movement as a counterculture and hope to change values.  Michael Greenberg, writing in the <em>New York Review of Books</em> (Feb. 9, 2012, 47) found that the “experience of undergoing a personal crisis of meaning, both political and of the soul, seemed deeply shared.”  But for the most part,   the human face of the movement has received less attention than its economic demands and its peculiar political structure.</p>
<p>While some demonstrators think of themselves as anarchists, there is an organizing principle:  horizontalism.  Theoretically, there are no leaders, no vertical structure of command.  Horizontalism employs a form of communication that is oddly reminiscent of the process of checking copies in Bartleby’s office.  Mattathias Schwartz in an early article in <em>The New Yorker</em> about the origins of Occupy Wall Street (Nov.28, 2011) writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At times, horizontalism [leaderlessness] can feel like utopian theater.  Its greatest invention is the “people’s mike,” which starts when someone shouts, “Mike check!”  Then the crowd shouts, “Mike check!,” and then phrases (phrases!) are transmitted (are transmitted!) through mass chanting (through mass chanting!).  In the same way that poker ritualizes capitalism and North Korea’s mass games ritualize totalitarianism, the people’s mike ritualizes horizontalism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are humans, then, horizontalists or copyists by nature?  Even in Bartleby’s office, where there is deference to leaders (verticalism), the other clerks, even the narrator, find themselves using Bartleby’s word…<em>preference</em>, though of course its meaning escapes them.</p>
<p>Thoreau had such a horror of unthinking conformity, it is impossible to think of him participating in the people’s mike.  He wants   no government, horizontal or not, just as he wants no standing army.  Insofar as they worked against slavery, both Thoreau and Emerson were politically active, but Thoreau’s resistance is passive.  He will not try to eradicate evil; he simply won’t support it.  It’s a matter of time, of spent life.  “A man has not everything to do,” he says, “but something.”  (<em>CD</em> 234)</p>
<p>What is this <em>something</em>?  What has Thoreau to do?  What has Bartleby to do?  Whatever it is they feel they must do, neither Thoreau nor Bartleby will compromise.  “Who would be a man must be a nonconformist….Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind,” says Emerson in <em>Self-Reliance.</em>  (261)</p>
<p>“The Soul,” says Emily Dickinson, “selects her own Society.”  Strangely, we keep arguing about who she meant by this Society instead of wondering what she meansby the next lines: &#8220;The Soul selects her own Society – / Then – shuts the Door – / To her divine Majority – / Present no more –&#8221;</p>
<p>What is this “divine Majority”?  And how does it differ from the majority neither Thoreau (nor Emerson) nor Bartleby respects?  Thoreau respects his conscience and Bartleby his preferences.  Each selects his own society and shuts the door.  Dickinson’s business, she says is circumference.  Circumference, like Thoreau’s conscience, implies something to be in orbit around.</p>
<p>Those left behind in the profane majority seem to need stories to understand these others, to place them within their own conventions.  The narrator offers the one bit of information he has heard about Bartleby’s life.  That Bartleby may have worked in a dead letter office explains his despair.  Thoreau, we say, lived rent free on Emerson’s land and took his laundry home to his mother, as if this proves his experiment was a sham.  Unlike Bartleby and Thoreau,   Dickinson in her solitude seems to us to be a romantic figure.  Lovers invent stories about her of unrequited or inappropriate love.  Scholars argue about who her lover was, but also about her psychopathological profile…agoraphobia?  epilepsy?  They speculate about some trauma in her life.  Incest, maybe?  Or maybe she was a lesbian, in love with her sister-in-law.  For the most part, we assume, however, that Dickinson’s assumptions were the assumptions of her time and place.  She saw New Englandly.  Therefore, we tell ordinary stories about her that explain her strange behavior.  Or, to put that another way,   we read her poems according to our own assumptions.</p>
<p>“This World,” she says, “is not Conclusion.  / A Species stands beyond –” For a moment she seems to share the “Dimity convictions” of the gentlewomen around her about Heaven and God.  But look again.  The assertion stands alone.  Even the punctuation expresses finality, a rare period instead of a dash.  “This World is not Conclusion.”  And yet there is nothing we can know beyond this world, however we try to fill the void.  “Sagacity” can’t solve the puzzle,  nor can “Much Gesture, from the Pulpit – ” reassure us.  Dickinson’s doubt is profound.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Narcotics cannot still the Tooth<br /> That nibbles at the soul –</p>
<p>Yet there are some things she is certain about.  She knows her own mind and is not comfortable with assumptions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">I cannot live with You –<br /> It would be Life –<br /> And Life is over there –<br /> Behind the Shelf</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">The Sexton keeps the Key to –</p>
<p>Because we are more interested in who this You is (Charles Wadsworth, a married Clergyman Dickinson met in Philadelphia?) than we are in what she means by “Life,” we hardly notice what a momentous distinction she has made.  Emily Dickinson, some believe, had no knowledge of the world.  She knew, however, the difference between the world of facts she faced and life over there behind the shelf of conventional morality.</p>
<p>Emerson was important to her.  And she resembles the idealist in his essay “The Transcendentalist,”  who,  in contrast to the sense bound materialist ,  has a metaphysical measure and  believes,  “Everything real is self-existent&#8230;.let the soul be erect,  and all things will go well.”  (195-196) Idealists, as Emerson describes them, resemble both Dickinson and Bartleby in that they “repel influences” and “incline to shut themselves in their chamber in the house.”  (200)  They are lonely, but,   according to Emerson, not melancholy.  They “feel the disproportion between their faculties and the work offered them.”  (199)  In other words, like Thoreau, they prefer not to “live what…  [is] not life.”  (<em>W</em> 65)</p>
<p>One thinks of our narrator and his admiration for John Jacob Astor.  He believes in the solidity of his life and in the work of Wall Street.  Yet Emerson’s description of how easily the “sturdy capitalist” can be shaken might apply to him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… no matter how deep and square on blocks of Quincy granite he lays the foundations of his banking-house or Exchange, [he]  must set it,  at last,  not on a cube corresponding to the angles of his structure,  but on a mass of unknown materials and solidity,  red-hot or white-hot,  perhaps at the core,  which rounds off to an almost perfect sphericity,  and lies floating in soft air,  and goes spinning away,  dragging bank and banker with it at a rate of thousands of miles the hour,  he knows not wither,—a bit of bullet,  now glimmering,  now darkling through a small cubic space on the edge of an unimaginable pit of emptiness.<br /> (194)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is into this pit that Dickinson dares to look.  This was the <em>something</em> she had to do.</p>
<p>Sometimes, although she lived at home, always among family, her loneliness seems immeasurable.  To her mentor Thomas Wentworth Higginson, she writes:   “Would you have time to be the ‘friend’ you should think I need?  I have a little shape—it would not crowd your Desk—nor make much Racket as the Mouse, that dents your Galleries—(174).  And yet she is not drawn to conventional solutions for loneliness, spiritual or otherwise.  She has stopped going to Church.  As she says, she keeps the Sabbath,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">….staying at Home –<br /> With a Bobolink for a Chorister –<br /> And an Orchard, for a Dome –<br /> (324)</p>
<p>This seems self-assured, even fey, but there are other poems that convey a sense of what courage it took to live in uncertainty,   to trust the integrity of her own soul.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">If I’m lost – now<br /> That I was found –<br /> Shall still my transport be –<br /> That once – on me – those Jasper Gates<br /> Blazed open – suddenly –</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">That in my awkward – gazing – face –<br /> The Angels – softly peered –<br /> And touched me with their fleeces,<br /> Almost as if they cared –<br /> I’m banished – now – you know it –<br /> How foreign that can be –<br /> You’ll know – Sir – when the Savior’s face<br /> Turns so – away from you –<br /> (256)</p>
<p>Dickinson does not flinch at the touch of those angelic fleeces, yet she refuses all false comfort.</p>
<p>The something she had to do meant Dickinson would not lead the life that was expected of her.  She takes her place outside,  observing with wicked wit  “What Soft – Cherubic Creatures –  /  These Gentlewomen are –  “(401)  On the other hand,  she is one of them,   if not a soft Cherubic Creature,  still a woman,  whose feelings are profound.  The question is what will she do with these feelings.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">“My Husband” – women say –<br /> Stroking the Melody –<br /> Is this – the way?<br /> (1072)</p>
<p>She makes a deliberate choice and her choice requires a breathtaking bravery.  “I’m ceded –” she says, “I’ve stopped being Theirs –”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">My second Rank – too small the first –<br /> Crowned – Crowing – on my Father’s breast –<br /> A half unconscious Queen –<br /> But this time – Adequate – Erect,<br /> With Will to choose, or to reject,<br /> And I choose, just a Crown –<br /> (508)</p>
<p>We don’t know what happened to Emily Dickinson to make her realize she had the will to choose, any more than we know what happened to Bartleby.  Maybe she fell in love, maybe she experienced an absolute lack of faith in anything outside of herself.  She is like one of those characters who has had a near death experience, and is never the same after.  Whatever it was, it touched a part of her consciousness that had not been awakened before, so that like Whitman, she knew that the historical Emily Dickinson was not the person she now saw, the Me Myself.  I think that was the horror she speaks of, that she felt herself splitting away from her ego, the small self and the larger unknowable self,   a dizzying revelation to which she devoted the rest of her life.</p>
<p>Recently, I heard someone say Dickinson took the easy way.  She stayed at home and didn’t try to change the world.  It reminded me of a professor who wrote a recommendation for me in which he pointed out how comforting it would have been for Emily Dickinson if someone had helped her to go back to school, to go out into the world.  This way of thinking is like giving the 99% what the 1% have stolen and calling it even.  Or it is like offering Bartleby an opportunity to go to law school.  At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the Occupy Movement set up several igloos and two yurts in a parking lot.  Inside the meeting hall itself  protestors wore  “garlands of  fake hundred-dollar bills”  and  displayed a fussball table where the game was between the rich and the poor and was,  of course, tilted in favor of the rich (March 5th <em>New Yorker</em>)</p>
<p>If Emily Dickinson is Bartleby’s twin, the room she called “freedom,”   is the opposite of Bartleby’s dim chamber.  He is living in the world, the world of Wall Street and of the World Economic Forum,   but he can’t look out from his blank window onto human life, as she can from her corner room.  Of course, Bartleby claims his own kind of sad freedom, but one cannot say of him, “let the soul be erect, and all things will go well.”  Melville is no Transcendentalist.</p>
<p>Dickinson survives.  In spite of doubt about Self, about Mortality or Immortality, about Consciousness itself, her integrity is unwavering.  She realizes that to mindlessly accept the assumptions of the community about death, about what life is and how to live it, and especially about what poetry is, is to play at Paste.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">We play at Paste –<br /> Till qualified, for Pearl –<br /> Then, drop the Paste –<br /> And deem ourself a fool –</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">The Shapes – though – were similar –<br /> And our new Hands<br /> Learned Gem – Tactics –<br /> Practicing Sands –<br /> (320)</p>
<p>The real poem is not a mere ornament, but confronts the real facts.  One imagines what Dickinson must have come to see as the intricacy of her art – of language.  Shakespeare,   for instance, made her feel what words were, not truth or feeling, which were as unknown as Eternity,   but words, which she could learn to use.</p>
<p>Sometimes she says, my business is Love.  We think of her as a mad recluse, but it was not that she felt nothing for others…she felt too deeply to dissemble.  Towards the end, her letters are so often letters of bereavement.  She mourns her dog Carlo, her father, her mother, her Philadelphia friend, her late love Otis Lord, her nephew… She felt deeply, personally, the moment of difference that death is, but also the loss of profound connection with other souls.</p>
<p>Emily Dickinson lived what is life and confronted these facts.  She was incapable of turning to available comforts, to god and heaven, or to conformity and achievement.  As a poet, she was incapable of embroidering expected consolations.  She was incapable of the sane behavior of ordinary women.  The truth she sees from her window is not the truth of the life of Emily Dickinson, not the truth of social justice or injustice, but the truth of what it means to be human, as experienced, without outside interference, by Emily Dickinson.  It is her orbit around the Consciousness that’s out there and to which the self can merely tune in, without hope of understanding,   which is the only Truth that can be told.</p>
<p>Unlike Dickinson, Bartleby lived in a world walled-in by human proprieties and the conventions governing competition.  And yet Bartleby’s orbit still exerts its peculiar force.  Everyone has a Bartleby,   someone to whom one responds for no reason the ego understands, as our narrator does to his unreasonable scrivener.  What can a former advisor to John Jacob Astor see in this no-account clerk?  Perhaps he responds to the truth about us as it appears in Bartleby, stripped bare of any pretensions, solitary and mortal.  Perhaps it is the narrator’s soul that recognizes itself reflected in Bartleby.</p>
<p>Both souls are languishing, unrecognized in the world of law and commerce, but might there not be some arrangement that nourishes our humanity as Wall Street does not?  Does the self-determination of the soul require that we shut the door on the frivolities of our society?  Or can the soul reform the world?  Emerson, who twice hosted the abolitionist John Brown in his Concord home, made an argument for Brown’s insanity after the raid on Harpers Ferry: “He is therefore precisely what lawyers call crazy, being governed by ideas, &amp; not by external circumstance.”  (Allen 590)  For himself, Emerson observed the distinction: “I know that the world I converse with in the city and in the farms, is not the world I <em>think</em>&#8230;.One day, I shall know the value and law of this discrepance.  But I have not found that much was gained by manipular attempts to realize the world of thought.”  (Experience 492)  “Let us treat the men and women well:” he says, “treat them as if they were real:  perhaps they are.”  (Experience 479)</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, in London, protestors comparing themselves to Jesus chasing the moneylenders out of the temple occupied the steps of St. Paul’s Cathedral.  When they were swept off the steps, an Anglican Bishop resigned.  Meanwhile, closer to home, Ben and Jerry of Vermont ice cream fame are trying to raise money so that the Occupy movement can have meetings instead of encampments.  They have enlisted the aid of representatives of the 1% who would like to help the 99%.  Ben Cohen is trying to come up with an ice cream flavor that captures the flavor of the movement.</p>
<p>According to the historian Howard Zinn, about every fifty years when economic disparity grows too blatant, there is a movement to change things, which produces only enough change to placate the 99% until another fifty years pass and the cycle repeats itself.  Still, it is invigorating to see people gathering, energized by the belief that our politics, the way we live together, might reflect our best nature, or even that the human imagination and not blind power might be the force that inspires us.</p>
<p>In 1964, the novelist Ken Kesey and his friends the Merry Pranksters, drove across the country on the bus Further.  “Don’t you know we’re all one?”  Kesey asks, looking back on that trip.  There had been a vision, then, of a new way things might be, a vision of a world where we’re all one.  But the mistake the Merry Pranksters made, according to Kesey, was thinking they were going to win.  “We developed vested interests in the victory to come….We begin to parcel off into little groups, whether it’s feminism, or  politics, money, or religion, whatever it is, everyone is jumping up and down in front of it.  Until nobody can see it clear anymore.”</p>
<p>No,  Kesey says,  “we’re meant to lose every time…. throughout history there have been these divine losers that just take a deep breath and go ahead knowing that society is not going to understand it, and not even caring because  they&#8217;re having a good time..&#8221;</p>
<p>“Much Madness is divinest Sense –” to Dickinson’s discerning eye.  But if Bartleby is a divine loser, he is not having a good time.  The new tenants of the Wall Street offices the narrator has vacated do not tolerate Bartleby’s presence in the stairwell.  He is arrested and taken to the infamous prison called the Tombs.  When the narrator visits him there, Bartleby refuses to speak to him.  “I know you,” he says, “and I want nothing to say to you.”  When the narrator says the Tombs is not so sad a place, that there is sky and grass, Bartleby replies, “I know where I am.”</p>
<p>Like Dickinson,   Bartleby does always know where he is.  In life, she chooses her Crown.  Bartleby dies, starving, huddled against a wall.  He seems to be asleep.  “With kings and counsellors,” says the narrator.  Does he mean death is the final level playing field?  or has he seen the regal nature of Bartleby’s preferences?</p>
<p>And do the narrator’s last words refer to the rumor of Bartleby’s work with dead letters or to his own deeper identification with the forlorn scrivener?</p>
<p>“Ah Bartleby!  Ah humanity!”</p>
