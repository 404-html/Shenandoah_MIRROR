								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For millennia<br />
Ra, the Sun<br />
streaked madly across the sky<br />
searching for<br />
The One.</p>
<p>Nothing would deter her<br />
not the mandarins on the trees, greening<br />
not the piggy-backing possums, keening for warmth<br />
not humankind, groping in the dark before their work was done.</p>
<p>She burned with red passion<br />
scalding hunger<br />
yellow need<br />
pure white loneliness.</p>
<p>Then one day she glimpsed</p>
<p>Maui.</p>
<p>Flexing, stretching, sunning<br />
himself epigrammatically<br />
on parched beach rocks<br />
his brown skin, cock, shone<br />
through sea salt sweat.</p>
<p>His muscles, ocean ripples<br />
softly calling<br />
from deep moana green<br />
Gasping, Ra stopped<br />
to stare<br />
at his lavalava hair hung<br />
over shoulders<br />
through the valley between his blades.</p>
<p>Moaning, Ra stopped<br />
to stare<br />
some more.</p>
<p>The earth started singing.</p>
<p>Mandarins sunned their skins<br />
leaves unfurled in wind<br />
Tui warmed their throats<br />
Kea expanded in light<br />
shaking darkness from their feathers<br />
humankind remembered the day<br />
and momentarily<br />
thought about play.</p>
<p>Maui looked up<br />
their eyes met.<br />
Whakama to be caught glaring so<br />
Ra fled.</p>
<p>Once again<br />
earth was dark.</p>
<p>Ra burned with love<br />
had become<br />
afraid.</p>
<p>Maui burned with contempt<br />
vowed<br />
to make her pay.</p>
<p>He would trap her, capture her, slow her down.</p>
<p>With his brothers he wove a magic net<br />
that could withstand Ra&#8217;s wrath.</p>
<p>But Ra was not in the dark.</p>
<p>Ra heard of the plan<br />
from the loquacious fantail<br />
whose song could always be bought for a good joke or two.</p>
<p>There was no flax net, magic or not,<br />
that could slow down the mightiest She-star in Te Kore.<br />
There was no demi-god who could out-power, out-shine<br />
out-manoeuvre the galaxy’s greatest fire-ball<br />
who dictated day and night,<br />
light and dark.</p>
<p>But Ra could feel her heart turn towards Maui<br />
pull her towards Maui<br />
her shadow Maui<br />
her bottomless ocean Maui<br />
her stellar remnant Maui<br />
her black hole Maui.</p>
<p>The thought of having his arms round her<br />
pulled close to him<br />
towards earth<br />
towards death<br />
was alluring<br />
to say the least.</p>
<p>Maui and his brothers worked<br />
three days and three nights<br />
weaving magic fibres.</p>
<p>They waited on a hill in the east for Ra to rise.<br />
They would beat her into submission<br />
slow her down for good.</p>
<p>Ra was wise to their plans<br />
But her heart eclipsed her mind<br />
As she savoured each preparatory moment<br />
when she was his sun, his moon, his stars.</p>
<p>She would only be ensnared<br />
by herself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr width="100%" />
<p>Note: In classical Māori mythology, Maui, the trickster demi-god, captured the sun and beat it in order to slow its rapid trajectory across the sky and lengthen the days.</p>
<p><em>whakama: </em>ashamed</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/622/files/2012/11/Ohio-1.mp3"> Emma Barnes &#8211; Ohio</a><br />
We make out awkwardly on the bed.<br />
And her shifting weight is a tide or the back of the bus.</p>
<p><em>Have you seen her lately?</em><br />
<em>Not since she moved out.</em></p>
<p>When we go to a costume party together she<br />
wears a lycra body suit and duct tapes a dildo</p>
<p>to her crotch. It bumps against me in the darkness<br />
like a bottlenose dolphin or a chair-lift.</p>
<p>Outside the party she kisses me again, her<br />
costume insistent. She has been dead for</p>
<p>two and a half years. She lay down to sleep<br />
at thirty-six and her heart failed. Like it</p>
<p>failed a test or failed a warrant or failed to<br />
come in to work that day like everyone else.</p>
<p>My fingernail split down to the cuticle and<br />
she climbed into my bed at dawn smelling</p>
<p>of chemicals and the last stand of the hospice.<br />
She moved out on my birthday and I ripped</p>
<p>up the note she wrote. I ripped up the note<br />
she left me that she wrote me, when she left.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr width="100%" />
<p>Note: A warrant is short for a Warrant of Fitness, which is a regular examination a motor vehicle has to pass to be roadworthy.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/622/files/2012/11/Rope-for-Shenandoah.mp3"> Hinemoana Baker &#8211; Rope </a><br />
He roped me, he roped me twice the second time<br />
it caught, fell at the right angle and landed around the bones<br />
of my dress. He roped me from the East like light rising, from the<br />
West like light falling, in the arrangement of his cutlery,<br />
the bubbling land moving on its plates. Without words<br />
or entertainment and without true silence he<br />
roped me in the mud, in the kind of mud people call sucking,<br />
or stinking, it sticks to one’s body, one’s feathers and folds.<br />
I couldn’t bear the thought of soup or vast pastures, he roped me<br />
without heart or dancing, when he called me his <em>wriggly little girl</em>.<br />
It was like freezing, when he roped me, I watched a thousand<br />
doors clap shut in the clouds. He roped me and began to pull,<br />
in spite of his own injuries, and I allowed him to be lonely.<br />
With a shovel I buried the turquoise feathers, warm from the sun,<br />
<em>winter in the blood</em>. In my mind I wrote letters to all those I’d<br />
wronged, <em>I want to be buried with a family resemblance.</em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When a child starts school, so too the parents:<br />
this is a truth cloudmother can’t escape.</p>
<p>Here are others – when a teacher favours a child,<br />
so too the parents; when a classmate befriends a child,</p>
<p>so too the parents; when a label owns a child,<br />
so too the parents. The mother most of all.</p>
<p>The handwriting lessons that failed to prepare her for life;<br />
the teachers who saw careers in computers not art or poetry;</p>
<p>the years she spent invisibly circling the schoolyard:<br />
the institutional past cloudmother thought she’d shed</p>
<p>returns. What follows are a sleepless night and a waking<br />
to a trick of the light that breaks across the harbour</p>
<p>and makes sea and sky one, their limpidity fusing them<br />
into image and duplicate, a lone kawau observing all.</p>
<p>When cloudmother escorts her son to class, everything<br />
he is yet to bear and be pained by unfurls in her</p>
<p>like a hailstorm. Drear mornings of multiplication<br />
when cloudboy’s eyes float outside to nimbostrati dark</p>
<p>and static as the wings of dead wasps or caged starlings;<br />
lunchtimes of lonely drifting around the playground</p>
<p>when reaching out towards faint cirrostrati refracted<br />
into halo phenomena is easier than making a friend;</p>
<p>afternoons reading <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em> to restless pyrocumuli,<br />
<em>“behold an Island in the Air, inhabited by Men who were able to raise,</em></p>
<p><em>or sink, or put it into Progressive Motion…”</em>: cloudmother sees<br />
these will precipitate her son’s future, just as for her they will</p>
<p>birth times before the bell when parents gather to gossip<br />
and she’ll race to places where only cloudboy can find her.</p>
<p>Later classmates will rain their mothers’ whispers upon cloudboy<br />
until they condense icily in the air he and cloudmother occupy:</p>
<p>cold spells about junk food turning cloudboy into a freak;<br />
cold spells about the mother turning cloudboy into a freak.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr width="100%" />
<p>Note: A year ago, my son was diagnosed with autism. It has taken us eight years of his life and four years of his schooling to reach this diagnosis. Parents of autistic children can find that one of the hardest things about supporting their child isn&#8217;t their autism but the inflexibility of the school system which, even in these enlightened times, can so easily and quickly make children outcasts because of their difference. This is certainly my experience. &#8220;Cloudmother&#8221; is part of a body of work I&#8217;m writing which voices the difficulties autistic children and their parents encounter. &#8220;Kawau&#8221; referenced in this poem is the Māori word for a black cormorant.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s mist like a frost net stretched over the paddock.<br />
The grain’s been cut and the baler has done its work.<br />
Now it’s time to set the paddock alight. Smoke<br />
drifts across the motorway. As usual we’re praying for rain.<br />
Did you know that in Roman times there was a big<br />
square opening in the roof of a <em>villa urbana?</em><br />
There were little spouts all around the edge of it.<br />
When it rained, the effect was of a waterfall pouring<br />
down inside your house. Pliny the Younger<br />
described something like this in one of the love-letters<br />
he wrote to his beautiful new young wife<br />
(the old one had died). He described the drainage holes<br />
in the floor as well and the compluvium, the underground water<br />
storage tank. You’d have to presume she was interested</p>
<hr width="100%" />
<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/622/files/2012/11/IMG_1520-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-159" title="IMG_1520 (1)" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/622/files/2012/11/IMG_1520-1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://shenandoahliterary.org/622/files/2012/11/IMG_1520-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/622/files/2012/11/IMG_1520-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Note: In 2003, John and I shifted from Christchurch, our home for 23 years, and moved 50 kilometers north to a tiny &#8220;hobbit-house&#8221;  at Amberley Beach. Just three minutes walk to the wide sweep of Pegasus Bay. Our portion of sea is not all that safe;  you’re best to swim only at low tide. Inland, the Waipara vineyards stretch towards high country farmland beyond which are the Southern Alps. My recent work explores this rural, beachy space. In 2011 Christchurch suffered a series of major earthquakes. Tragically, 185 people died. The inner city was devastated. I’m noticing  the theme of <em>domus  </em>(Latin: home) in much of my new work.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is tea time, the wind is hard and cold,<br />
I run, head down, up Champion Street.<br />
Two things to remember, two things to get,<br />
<em>Small tin of peaches, half pint of cream, don’t forget!</em><br />
Then the lights of the Four Square store.<br />
Inside lolly bags hang in rows. In the cabinet<br />
blackberries and raspberries, licorice straps,<br />
gobstoppers, two for threepence. In my hand<br />
hot with holding, a florin and a sixpence. If I get<br />
a quarter pint of cream there’ll be money left over.<br />
I fiddle with the money in my pocket, look up<br />
at the lolly bags, a man with a manager’s badge<br />
is in front of me looking down.<br />
<em>Let’s see what’s in here shall we mister!</em><br />
He jerks open my raincoat, a button flies off,<br />
I go back and forth in his hands, he reaches in<br />
the pockets, pulls the coat this way and that.<br />
He huffs, walks away, rubs his hands together,<br />
<em>chilly out there isn’t it?</em> to a lady coming in.</p>
<p>Outside it is cold, I stand for a long time,<br />
tuck in the coat where the button has gone,<br />
walk home. My mother taking plates out of<br />
a cupboard, <em>what took you so long? where</em><br />
<em> are the peaches? what’s the matter?</em><br />
She bangs the plates down. I tell her,<br />
put the money on the bench. It sticks to<br />
my hand. She pulls out the tucked in part<br />
of the coat where the button was, her eyes<br />
go big, she turns, yanks the knife and fork drawer out,<br />
it crashes on the floor, snatches up the<br />
rolling pin, marches to the front door, yells<br />
my father’s name twice. He hurries after her.<br />
My brothers now beside me in the hall.<br />
Voices outside. We go upstairs to our bedroom<br />
close the door, switch on the light, sit on the bunks.<br />
The front door closes. The knife and fork<br />
drawer is put back in. Then my father’s footsteps<br />
on the stairs. He comes in, rubs my head,<br />
<em>It’ll be alright</em>, and gives us all a lifesaver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr width="100%" />
<p>Note: In 1963, after living for six years on the South Pacific island of Niue, our family returned to New Zealand and lived in Cannons Creek in Porirua, a state (i.e. government built) house district. The initial incident was probably due to shoplifting in the area. I never forgot how the manager could instantly &#8220;move on,&#8221; whereas I felt numb, or my Cook Island mother storming out clutching the rolling pin, and of course the crash of the knife and fork drawer on the floor (I thought I was about to get a whipping).</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>He believed in the dust that was beaten<br />
from rugs, how it became<br />
the stars of the Milky Way,<br />
and he would share the last hours of animals<br />
with his uncle the butcher<br />
who played to them on the violin.</p>
<p>And he knew the tyranny of perspective<br />
will kill us all<br />
and that even the chairs get bored<br />
in Vitebsk,<br />
from sitting alone<br />
in the courtyard all day.</p>
<p>So, <em>stay here with your herrings</em>, he said—<br />
<em>my concern is with movement,</em><br />
<em> with the paradise lost of childhood</em><br />
<em> and absolution of Art and Love—</em><br />
<em> though when Bella died</em><br />
<em> the world went dark before my eyes</em>.</p>
<p>But we all need to copy what we already possess<br />
and so he remade on the canvas<br />
the lack of alcohol,<br />
the reality that lies beyond<br />
the shadows at play on the wall,<br />
the images and forms that we like to say</p>
<p>are simply those who are passing us by.<br />
So where are you going,<br />
Mr. Oxcart Man, with your creaking wheels<br />
on the old dirt road?<br />
Will you make it through<br />
to the seasons of another year?—</p>
<p>And play out its days on your violin<br />
as you fly<br />
to the farm where a goat and horse still graze<br />
and the poet reclines<br />
beneath a lilac sky<br />
waiting for the evening stars to appear.</p>

<p>Note: &#8220;Chagall in Vitebsk&#8221; is based partly on notes scrawled during a cinema viewing of <em>Chagall</em>, the 1963 short documentary directed by Lauro Venturi. The final stanza references Chagall’s early painting &#8220;The Poet Reclining,&#8221; from the sequence known as &#8220;Scenes from Vitebsk.&#8221; The painting, images of which can be found on the internet, entranced me when I first came across it in the Tate Modern, in 1970, aged 15, and – probably for the enigmatic insouciance of the subject-matter – set me firm in my youthful resolve that poetry was the only career worth pursuing.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/622/files/2012/11/in-corners-under-frames-1.mp3"> Kay Cooke &#8211; in corners, under frames </a><br />
It concentrates, this house, straining with the effort<br />
to remember it once had a green roof<br />
and a garden full of pink phlox.<br />
It&#8217;s my mother-in-law&#8217;s childhood home</p>
<p>now remaindered as a holiday house<br />
and empty most of the year. She remembers<br />
the tin sheet hammered over the window-frame<br />
after the glass broke, how the wind howled through.</p>
<p>Seventy-something years on and three owners later<br />
we&#8217;re here on a day stoked with autumn,<br />
invited to look around.<br />
My mother-in-law notes the things that are the same;</p>
<p>the rotund hot-water cylinder like a rolled-up sleeve,<br />
the wardrobe, its sweet metal catch. A brass hook.<br />
“After coming back inside from the farm,<br />
Pop would hang his coat on that very peg.&#8221;</p>
<p>As we look around, the present owner&#8217;s foxy<br />
snuffles and whines at the smell of mice<br />
behind the skirting boards. Outside<br />
there&#8217;s a persistent view of rocks, tussock</p>
<p>and the lake, of the pear tree with its back to us,<br />
huge and self-important.<br />
The owner tells us that it was in the &#8217;70s<br />
when they first looked at this house.</p>
<p>On a bitter day of snow, she said.<br />
She remembers the sputtering open fire<br />
with two sticks for fuel<br />
and the man and woman desperate to sell,</p>
<p>shivering with the disappointment<br />
of dead strawberry plants. As she describes it all<br />
she points to things unseen,<br />
in corners and under frames.</p>
<p>“I remember it well,” she said,<br />
“The man sat at the table, right there,&#8221;<br />
she outlines its shadow, “right there,<br />
eating Weet-Bix with gravy.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note: Sometimes a poem just falls out of an actual occurrence described verbatim. My mother-in-law had long wanted to visit her childhood home in Kingston, a small town at the southern arm of Lake Wakapitu. When the chance came to do so, we took it. The surge of memories for her was overwhelming. It was a special thing to be there with her and to be able to place her as a small girl living in this house, nevertheless the most striking image I took away with me was the extraordinary (if unpalatable) one of the man eating a plate of breakfast grain with gravy.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>That when Julie phoned, late at night, you cried out like a wounded animal.<br />
That you crooned ‘No Julie’ and ‘Oh Julie’ over and over,<br />
until the words caught up with each other and turned<br />
from tigers into butter.</p>
<p>That it was only a month before the due date, so that in everyone’s head<br />
the baby had already arrived and was sleeping peacefully in the blue bassinet<br />
beneath the brightly coloured animal mobile.</p>
<p>That Julie knew something was wrong because the baby had stopped moving.<br />
That the doctor said yes, something is wrong, the baby has stopped living.</p>
<p>That Julie had to carry it inside her for three days before they could induce her.<br />
That she had to go into labour and give birth in the usual way.<br />
That you were still to be her support person.</p>
<p>That, on the day, you went off into the impossible waiting,<br />
then came home for dinner, eyes puffy and dilating,<br />
until the second phone-call came.</p>
<p>That the labour went as if scripted:<br />
‘Once things get going, they often happen quickly.’<br />
That Julie was terrific and pushed the baby out.<br />
That when it appeared, Zac said ‘It’s too quiet in here.’</p>
<p>That Julie held the baby. That she played with it.<br />
That you and Zac held the baby.<br />
That it was almost like a baby, except, you said afterwards,<br />
it was so dead.</p>
<p>That, as requested, you took photos,<br />
which would later show how dead.<br />
That blueness.</p>
<p>That you went into the corridor to give Julie and Zac space<br />
and, sitting with your cup of tea, you could hear<br />
a heartbeat monitor from one room and,<br />
from another,<br />
Julie<br />
sobbing and sobbing.</p>
<p>That you got home about 6 a.m., but still went into school and taught all day.<br />
That Julie and Zac went home to their house filled with baby stuff and flowers.</p>
<p>That for you, having had two homebirths, it was the opposite of what a birth should be.<br />
That your mind got you through it – shut out the word ‘macabre’ till later.</p>
<p>That it was the worst night of your life.</p>
<p>That the funeral was as can be imagined, so it was good to get out<br />
to the tiny gravesides and feel the air sting our faces.</p>
<p>That the autopsy could find no reason.</p>
<p>That Julie’s best friend was also eight months pregnant,<br />
and a month later gave birth to a healthy baby girl.</p>
<p>That Julie has a floppy mummy-tummy.<br />
That she cried when she got her period.</p>
<p>That, for Julie, Milly-Rose had been alive in the world because<br />
how can you blame the longing for a baby?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sabina sits holding a hen looking more<br />
like a hen than the hen looks.<br />
It is her face, lifted up, the way<br />
hens lift up their faces, wary,<br />
or the way they eye each other up<br />
a little lofty, a little haughty.<br />
Sabina has a theory about loyalty:<br />
talking behind their backs<br />
is only disloyal down the chain:<br />
you don&#8217;t criticise your best friend<br />
to a new<em> </em>friend but you can criticise<br />
a good friend to your best friend or<br />
the new friend to a better friend.<br />
Boyfriends gradually get worked up<br />
the chain till, when you can criticise<br />
your best friend to them, but<br />
not them to your best friend, <em>that&#8217;s </em><br />
how you know it is time to marry them.<br />
The dream that you are walking over glass<br />
to reach <em>the other man</em>?<br />
You don&#8217;t tell that to anyone.</p>
