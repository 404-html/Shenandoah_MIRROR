								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The widow rocks on her worn-down porch<br />
as Sister Aimee pipes Foursquare Gospel<br />
on Saturday night. Sister has the spirit,</p>
<p>she makes you feel as clean as a wedding dress,<br />
as modern as the Packard Gospel Car<br />
she drives to her Angelus Temple</p>
<p>where twin broadcast towers<br />
spiral up to heaven, beam<br />
her Bridal Call straight to Iowa.</p>
<p>Tonight healing comes to the widow<br />
with her hands flat on the set,<br />
KFSG radio, radio, radio.</p>
<p>Sunday she heads past the weathered feed store<br />
to the frame church with the boxy steeple<br />
facing the dry landscape of foreclosure.</p>
<p>She clasps her hymn book, raises<br />
her voice to the highest rafter,<br />
Lord, end this weather, fix the tractor,</p>
<p>smite the mortgage. Amen.<br />
After church, the blistered porch again,<br />
the rocker, the paper, the personals</p>
<p>serving their meal of local woe,<br />
“Golden oak dining set, must sell,”<br />
“Bertha Jane, your mother still ill,”</p>
<p>“Lucas, fix the tent for Harry Joe.”<br />
Harry Joe begs to wash your sins away,<br />
baptizes next week, names the day:</p>
<p>“Only Known Photograph of Jesus: Will Show.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Kildrummie, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, 1661-62</em></p>
<p>I spoke to her bent head, her clenched, gloved hands:<br />
We’d test the sign she brought, then find amends.<br />
We watched as the strand of hair left in her bed<br />
Curled wormlike, snakelike in my flame; then shriveled,<br />
Fell. So the spurting seed she’d felt within<br />
Was proved false dew, I said; could never quicken<br />
In her mortal wame. She started then—the gleam<br />
Of her wide eyes met mine. I spelled a name</p>
<p>For some long-past minister of her present manse<br />
Whose spirit found her bed: a pious man,<br />
Who held his wife most dear, but secret grieved<br />
No son was spared to them. Not one of three<br />
Breathed long, and so his father’s ancient name<br />
Was lost amidst a host of gabbling names.</p>
<p>She sighed, but kept her hand upon her purse:<br />
But if ‘twere a devil come&#8211;could she be sure?<br />
A devil’s hoof would tear her bed, I said;<br />
But if he be your lord, or like enough, his seed<br />
Is meant to thrive: I see he’ll be some pious man<br />
Who’ll sire a son, some gentle human man.</p>
<p>She smiled, and stood. The purse she slid to me<br />
Was two coins scant. This was not the bargain we<br />
Had made, I said; without the herbs I’d culled,<br />
What chance? She scowled, and from her bodice pulled<br />
A small child’s ring, from her mother’s sister’s kin,<br />
Inset with stone, that her lord had never seen.<br />
The stone was dull, the metal bent, but true:<br />
I gave into her hands the salves I’d brewed.</p>
<p>[from a sequence &#8212; based on parish, clan and social histories &#8212;  in the voice of 17th century sorcerer in Scotland&#8217;s Central Highlands]</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We study charts that tell us at what age<br />
Our blood pressure will likely rise, while<br />
symptomless, the body lies.  Oh yes, it&#8217;s capable<br />
of subterfuge, a front for all its fears.<br />
We can&#8217;t really blame it.</p>
<p>No body entirely recognizes itself.<br />
Yet now that its deepest secrets, its codes,<br />
can be plotted, we agonize<br />
over what to ask, hearing<br />
<em>Whatever will be will be</em> stream through us in the voice<br />
of Doris Day, and we tell ourselves it&#8217;s nobody&#8217;s fault,<br />
least of all ours, if our bodies have their own ideas<br />
and will proceed along the paths<br />
buried inside themselves,<br />
<em>ourselves</em>, striding fast to keep breathing<br />
deep and rhythmically, to encourage<br />
mind to stay as close as it can<br />
to who it believes it is now,<br />
even as our cells wind down<br />
and down.</p>

<p>Maybe vampires hear an annunciatory trumpet solo.<br />
Maybe they gather at the customary tourist traps<br />
like a blanket of pink flamingos plating a lake<br />
and lake shore by the tens of thousands to drink.<br />
The whole, tacky blood circus is theme-park stuff<br />
and as Disneyesque as lifting the lid on a casket<br />
to flit about sampling the inexhaustible offerings<br />
of O Positive like the Sunday brunch at IHOP.<br />
But if you had a booming, amphitheatrical voice<br />
and had been recently rescued from the grave—<br />
if you wore the republic of the dark like a cape<br />
at Halloween, all bets would be off by the signage<br />
for Paradise Tire &amp; Service, a neon-green royal palm.<br />
Bela Lugosi could materialize on a trailer-park lawn<br />
and the locals would miss it, though lapdogs howled<br />
as kingdoms rose and fell. You could say a kingdom<br />
of fangs glows and drips red by the broken temples<br />
and wide, well-lit aisles of Best Buy and Wal-Mart.<br />
By the shadowed homeless holding up placards<br />
hand-lettered in English, as if the kind-hearted<br />
of the nations of the world spoke one language<br />
and could be counted on to forgive misspellings,<br />
bad syntax that announces one life is never enough.<br />
The resurrection of the body is tough everywhere.<br />
In the Sunshine State, despite eons to shake off loss,<br />
a body carries the added burden of perpetual labor<br />
and cyclical, inescapable debt. The dead know this.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The clevis has lost its pin<br />
says the griot.  We know what he means.<br />
Such are the squalid futures of the small.<br />
Yet thinning beyond recognition<br />
gave Marc Antony an inner life to envy.<br />
In much of the country important links<br />
go missing, like a cotter key<br />
or the O-ring on distant travel.<br />
Just in case, there&#8217;s always the allure<br />
of new beginnings, but after taking wing<br />
we want to get back safely.<br />
As we start to take the long view<br />
we think about the things<br />
we&#8217;re going to leave unfinished<br />
and the forecast is not good<br />
for the endless summer<br />
picnic of potato salad<br />
and American pie.<br />
Some say that the infinitude that precludes<br />
the best possible gin or martini<br />
also precludes the best possible world.<br />
Though all things decline<br />
from their perfection (such as it is)<br />
you still wonder why there is anything at all.</p>

&#8212; William Stafford</p>
<p>Still and all, Stafford kept on going,<br />
morning after morning at his table.</p>
<p>I see him now, sitting in my armchair,<br />
eyes half-closed, resting his fertile mind.</p>
<p>You never know, he told me once in passing,<br />
where, when you shoot it, a bullet will end up.</p>
<p>May he rest, whose mind so seldom rested,<br />
probing as it did the world’s unending darkness.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have scattered, have dithered and dathered, the humans<br />
In helmets, in velvet, and veil, the humans recoil to their roosts<br />
With buckles and booze, in funny white shoes,<br />
The humans in duds of charmeuse, in knickers or knit, they scatter</p>
<p>And gather to chitter and chatter. The humans they scatter,<br />
They wave and they whimper the glib and the glibber, scattered<br />
Like feathers or flint. They rumble and riot, roost<br />
In the viaduct, cruel fellas in slippers or boots, shoes</p>
<p>Patent or suede, slacks checkered with jade, shoo<br />
Them home with their cheap chirping hearts, battered they scatter,<br />
The dear pitter patter of boys and girls tumbled and tossed, scattered<br />
Then smattered they swig and they swagger and shoot, shoehorned</p>
<p>And shopworn, the hoodlums and well-born, the humans<br />
All clamor, get fatter and fatter, their brims and their shoe<br />
Leather burst, go home to your harems, your roosts<br />
Ripe with cherubs, you belles and you barons, your shoes</p>
<p>Laced with scarabs, you roosters and hens, you peckers in pens, you scatter<br />
and stammer and flit. The humans, they want and they wane. The humans</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/622/files/2013/01/Buckeye-.mp3">Audio recording of Buckeye Read by the Author</a><br />
It didn’t make sense to invest so much<br />
in a pocketed nut. But for ten sure springs,<br />
my grandmother withdrew a buckeye<br />
from her purse and placed it in my palm.</p>
<p>I was a mother three times over,<br />
my grandmother long buried, before I missed<br />
them. This morning, passing her home, I saw<br />
a bright fruit hanging, strange as Fatima’s Eye</p>
<p>and trespassed beyond the present<br />
resident’s curb to glimpse close what I knew<br />
I’d never seen. Who’d have bet by dinner<br />
I’d tell my children how gamblers hollow</p>
<p>and fill them with mercury? Or that I’d<br />
finally grasp the weight of her bargain,<br />
grace that can’t be banked, or left in a will,<br />
an annual transaction turned to spare me</p>
<p>bad marriages, collisions, infants sick<br />
and dead. Lush as plums in split suede shells,<br />
her buckeyes still fall where she caught them<br />
dark in the cup of her own luckless palm.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rugged individualism? Sure,<br />
but long gone corporate, plus the Dutch<br />
and French, and the Spanish before them<br />
settling around the ports and islands.<br />
For many years the enterprise is reliant<br />
on native shipments and trade with natives.<br />
Forests and swamps, scalpings and mosquitoes<br />
conspire against the farming—of what, now?<br />
Roughnecks and thieves<br />
call the handful of available women<br />
unspeakable vamps, begging the governor<br />
to write on their behalf for more,<br />
preferably attractive ones, to be shipped,<br />
stealing off in the meantime with squaws.<br />
Liquor, yellow fever and gain,<br />
and a fort changes hands with a peaceful surrender.<br />
Another decays at the edge of a swamp<br />
as tribe displaces tribe on a northeast trajectory.<br />
Crossing rivers is a dangerous business,<br />
but rivers are highways, the only convenience,<br />
for which, if not the season’s strictures, or a rain<br />
of arrows, then some government<br />
exacts its due. Evangelizing<br />
in the waste thicket couldn’t seem more ridiculous.<br />
Treaty and intrigue, peace pipes, trifles<br />
and the shared black drink. Handsome clear<br />
rivers cloud. Hunting grounds<br />
are hemmed, speculated: hunting camps<br />
in the modern parlance. The axe resounds.<br />
It ends twenty years short of its writing,<br />
capriciously with friends of Napoleon<br />
thrashed off the coast in a heavy gale,<br />
governed by an obsolete chart,—<br />
a state of peril would seem to be the point.</p>
