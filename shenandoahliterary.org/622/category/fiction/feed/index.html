								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we arrived at Otxandio, I hoped to sleep, but the priest was trying to take the three women’s confessions, and The Butcher, spotting our uniforms, pulled us from the crowd and asked if our rifles still had bullets. We said yes, and he gave us a bottle of wine and told us to wait in the back of the lorry. At least two dozen people crowded around, spitting curses at the women.</p>
<p>I put my nose over the bottle. It was vino de pitarra—a severe, soil-flavored wine that reminded me of the fighting in Elorrio when the earth erupted around us and I couldn’t get the taste of dirt out of my mouth no matter how many times I was sick. The wine’s grapes grew everywhere in the valley, and even at my hungriest I’d yet to eat any.</p>
<p>I tipped the bottle back but kept my lips pursed and then gave it to Isidro. My hands still shook. The houses in Otxandio alternated between those made of cobblestones and those that were stucco and as white as the snow-capped Mount Gorbeia in the distance. The moon was full and low, and the white houses looked as if they had been scrubbed or painted that day, as if the villagers were expecting somebody of importance. Isidro nudged my knee with the bottle, but I waved it away.</p>
<p>A little girl was with one of the women. She had a tight grip on her mother’s shirt and wouldn’t let go. The other two climbed into the back of the lorry. I turned my hands to see the dark spots that were Francisco’s blood. Finally, The Butcher grabbed the girl and lifted her into the back with us. Her mother followed.</p>
<p>“The girl, too?” I asked.</p>
<p>There must have been a crack in my voice because The Butcher laughed. “She’s just coming along for the ride,” he said before opening the passenger side of the truck.</p>
<p>The road snaked along the base of Mount Gorbeia. To my left, the silhouette of a beech forest stood out against the night.  The trees looked like monstrous hands growing out of the earth—their naked branches, grotesque and skeletal fingers, reached towards something in the sky. They were there, I knew, to remind me that there was a force out there other than us. One of the women had her leg pressed against mine. I felt its warmth but was too tired to move.</p>
<p>When the road straightened, the truck slowed to a stop. The woman’s leg tensed. The Butcher came around the back and motioned to the mother of the girl. The woman hugged her daughter and wiped the tears from her face, kissed her on the cheek, and said to hurry home that she’d be back soon enough. The Butcher held out his hands for the girl, but the woman spat at him and lifted the girl over the tailgate and set her on the ground. Hurry home, she said. Isidro looked over at me, but there was nothing in his eyes. I imagined he was as tired as I was. It’d be impossible to think that he wouldn’t have been. “Hurry home,” The Butcher said, and soon we were off again and the girl disappeared in a cloud of dust tinted blue by the moon. I expected the mother to cry or to search through the dust for her daughter, but she set her jaw forward and remained as still as a monument, the only movement coming from the bumps in the road.</p>
<p>Off in the distance I saw the village of Legutio and the steeple in the plaza and felt the cold air coming off the lake’s surface. We got close enough so that I saw light coming from a window and then the driver parked the truck but kept the engine rumbling. He stepped out and lit a cigarette and walked until his shape disappeared into the darkness.</p>
<p>The Butcher ordered the women out, and we followed them from the lorry’s bed. He walked with them to the side of the road. They didn’t resist but resigned themselves to their stories’ end. I suppose the furthest one on the edge, the mother of the little girl, could have tried to run, but she didn’t, and Isidro tipped the bottle of wine back until there was nothing left. He tossed it on the ground then wiped his mouth with his forearm while retrieving his rifle.</p>
<p>The Butcher made a grunting sort of orgasmic sound and in a jerky motion grabbed one of the women by the hair, and I saw the white of her neck for a moment, exposed as it was to the moon, and then he plunged his knife into her throat. Blood burst from her and spurted onto his face. It all looked black. The other woman ran, and Isidro and I shot at her until she crumpled and cried out in pain. I hit her in the leg. The mother of the little girl just slumped to the ground as if she’d been shot or stabbed, and waited. The Butcher laughed as he finished with the woman. His teeth shone. The other woman had been trying to crawl away, but her ruined leg was a weight. The Butcher put his boots into her face, and it went dark with blood so that I couldn’t make out her features anymore. Her arms shook but this was only the nerves. The mother sat still through this and remained so even after The Butcher squatted in front of her and whispered something in her ear though she didn’t give any indication that the words reached her. He tapped the bottom of her chin with his bloody knife and looked into her eyes. He said a few more things to her that I couldn’t make out and then stood up. He walked past her but as he did he sunk the knife into the back of her neck just as the matadors do with the bulls, and she fell with a defeated finality just as those bulls do when their spinal cords have been severed, an exhausted mass on the ground.</p>
<p>The Butcher called for the driver and from out of the darkness I could see the glowing cherry of his cigarette. “What about the bodies?” I asked.</p>
<p>“They bury their own around here,” The Butcher said.</p>
<p>The drive back to Otxandio took less time. I thought we would come upon the girl, but we never saw her. Eventually, the truck pulled up to a tavern, and The Butcher slapped me on the back. “My valiant ones,” he said, “you earned your drinks tonight.” The blood had dried on his face.</p>
<p>The priest and a few other men had been waiting inside for us. They shook our hands and poured us some of that god-awful wine, and the priest said a prayer for us and our souls and our land and the fight ahead. I think it was a prayer, but maybe I thought this because he was a priest. Out of anybody else’s mouth the words wouldn’t have been all that special. We raised our glasses, and I tried to force the wine down but coughed it up, and Isidro hit my back several times. The Butcher called for another round. Isidro and I didn’t know anyone so after a while we sat by ourselves against the wall and looked out the window towards the mountains. The sun had broken over the horizon, shadows moved across the plains. The snow was as bright as before and the houses just as white. I wouldn’t have been surprised to see someone going by each one scrubbing them clean. I’d never before seen a village so polished to the bone.</p>
<p>Isidro’s eyes were half closed. “How many days ago did Francisco die?” he asked.</p>
<p>“That happened today,” I said.</p>
<p>“Don’t fuck with me,” he said.</p>
<p>I leaned my head against the window. It was cold and I felt that I could stay there forever. I realized that we still needed to find lodgings. My skin itched. It didn’t feel like my own.</p>
<p>“I think I’m losing my mind,” he said.</p>
<p>Across the street an old man left his house. He looked toward the square where the people had gathered earlier in the evening then went back inside.</p>
<p>“You’re not touching your wine?”</p>
<p>“I can’t stand the taste of the stuff,” I said.</p>
<p>He reached over and raised it off the table. “To Francisco,” he said.</p>
<p>We’d been together since those first days in Markita and then his head popped like a squeezed grape. Just like that. It was the only bullet fired. The day had been a peaceful one and after the gunshot’s last ripples faded, the sounds of nature returned, and the rifleman, wherever he had been, never fired at us again. We couldn’t find him, and we spent the rest of the afternoon digging a grave for Francisco in the cemetery outside of Arrazola.</p>
<p>“My valiant ones,” The Butcher said, “join us. We’re in this fight together for the soul of this land. We should also drink together.”</p>
<p>“My skin doesn’t feel like my own,” I said to Isidro as we stood. “I need to get some sleep.”</p>
<p>“One more drink,” Isidro said, “and then we’ll see which one of these guys can put us up for the night.”</p>
<p>The sun’s light came in squarely through the windows now, and The Butcher moved over on the bench to make room for us. The priest was drunk and hummed a song popular among the Loyalists in those days.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The people who think they know best rarely do. Sylvia Fitzgerald, who thought she was smarter than everyone, should have known better than to take her younger sister, Peregrine, out driving. Sylvia’s best ideas always led to trouble. The more brilliant it sounded at the beginning, the more trouble it led to. Sylvia had learned this from experience. She was always getting brainstorms, and they were always going awry. From the age of four, “Hey, what if . . . ?” had been her mantra; but while the boring ideas worked out, the really good ones always flopped.</p>
<p>And still she got them—the brilliant ones, the kind that in elementary school history texts were sometimes signalled by pictures of light bulbs. In Sylvia’s opinion, often expressed to those who knew her, these ideas had gotten better and better, until they approached Edisonian radiance. Which is why Perry had once teasingly called her “Sylvania”—after the light bulbs.</p>
<p>One of the worst ideas so far had been not going to college.  She’d gotten a job right away, but it was at Buy-All, and it was going nowhere. She was still living at home; she’d signed a lease and paid monthly rent. She had her own apartment in the basement with a microwave and a sink. She’d bought a ten-year-old Honda Civic. She’d been exempted from chores and curfew.</p>
<p>She was on her own, almost, and she wanted Perry to be impressed, but Perry wasn’t. Perry, the beautiful nerd: all brains and no risk-tolerance. She hadn’t even learned to drive, or so they’d all thought until recently. Seventeen years old, and she still rode her bike wherever she wanted to go. Or their mother drove her. It was just sad, Sylvia had said. And that—the absurdity of her smart and capable sister still biking to the library like a ten-year-old—was what had first given Sylvia the idea.</p>
<p>Prior to that, Sylvia had been trying to curb her imagination. But teaching Perry to drive had sounded like a safe idea: useful, surefire, harmless. How could she have guessed that a simple driving lesson would lead to the trouble the Fitzgeralds were now dealing with? But it wasn’t just the driving lesson.  That was only the start of things.</p>
<p>Two months ago, her younger sister had only seen Springfield from her bicycle or the back seat of Mrs. Fitzgerald’s Lincoln, en route to one branch library or another, or a bookstore or lecture—the only places she ever went. But she’d never <em>seen</em> it, not by moonlight, not the best parts, not from the driver’s seat. That was what Sylvia had wanted to show her.</p>
<p>Now Perry had had a glimpse of Sylvia’s inky night world. She’d cruised the city with her sister at three in the morning. So what if they’d had a close call? No one had gotten hurt or in trouble.  You would think it would make Perry want to go out and see more, but Perry showed no inclination to go anywhere.  She just paced around their new house, moaning.</p>
<p>The new house was a brick split-foyer, in one of those select developments that is going to be all turf-managed lawns someday but for the time being is all mud flats. The Fitzgeralds’ half million-dollar home was adrift on a sea of mud, and if Perry had stepped out the front door, descended the fieldstone steps and walked around the house, she would have come back with two clumps of mud where her shoes had been. But instead of going around outside, Perry circled the interior: upstairs, downstairs, smaller circuits of the landing or family room. Several weeks of her sporadic pacing, and the pile carpet was showing wear; it was that cheap. “We should put her in a tub of grapes and let her make wine,” said Sylvia.</p>
<p>But she didn’t really think it was funny.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the first time Perry’s behavior had puzzled them. When, at two and a half, she still sat on her diapered bottom, crawling only to escape Sylvia, (who liked to pinch her to make her cry), their parents, referred by the girls’ regular pediatrician, had consulted a pediatric orthopedist. Margaret explained to the doctor, “She doesn’t even pull herself up on furniture yet. We’re concerned about developmental delays.”</p>
<p>The doctor palpated Perry’s legs and arms, watched her crawl for few minutes, percussed key tendons with a reflex hammer, watched her crawl some more. Even before he examined her, though, he seemed to have formed his opinion: “There’s nothing wrong with her. She just doesn’t want to walk.”</p>
<p>Perry had been fishing in the lower drawers of the exam room supply cabinets, and before she knew what he was doing, the doctor grabbed her, put her on her feet and let go. She stood steadily for a moment, then carefully sat down again.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen this,” he said. “With certain kids you have to induce walking. Have you tried the old carrot on a stick? What does she want that’s off limits?”</p>
<p>“My toys,” growled Sylvia. She had come along because she’d whined and tantrummed: preschool “gave her headaches,” she insisted.</p>
<p>“Sibling rivalry,” the doctor murmured. To Sylvia he said, “I bet you teach your little sister a lot of things, don’t you?”</p>
<p>Sylvia shrugged.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ve got an important job for you. Take one of your toys, one she really wants, hold it in front of your little sister—and don’t let her have it. See if you can teach her to walk.”</p>
<p>It worked. At home later, Perry walked without a wobble to the book Sylvia held out. But then Sylvia was forced to give it to her. “<em>You</em> never read it,” said their mother.</p>
<p>It was true that Sylvia was not intellectual.</p>
<p>Later, when Perry continued to toddle around without falling, they figured she must have been rehearsing secretly. That was the difference between the two girls: Sylvia was impulsive, fearless. Perry was cautious. Sylvia was transparent. You always knew what she was up to. Perry was close-mouthed. And she never did anything badly—probably because she’d always practiced in secret first. When she first talked, she talked in paragraphs. The first time she sat down at the Fitzgeralds’ new laptop, she knew the password and logged on without hesitation. Over the years they’d all learned that it was best not to push her. She’d do things in her own time, and excel when she did. She was named for the falcon that had glided through one of Margaret Fitzgerald’s dreams during her second pregnancy. Of the girls’ parents, Margaret was more like Sylvia: mystical and impulsive, though these qualities had been largely beaten out of her by motherhood. She was what you might call a transcendentalist-manqué. She sensed that there was, or ought to be, something more. Which was why she’d named her second daughter after a dream.</p>
<p>And another difference: Perry brought out the best in everyone, while Sylvia got a mixed reception, more often rude than polite. Men especially liked her sister. Something about Perry’s strawberry-blonde seriousness made them want to protect her. Like the young door-to-door salesman Sylvia called  “the Aztec,” who for some months before the driving lesson had been going house to house in the subdivision selling cemetery plots and prepaid funerals.</p>
<p>He wasn’t really an Aztec, but he was obviously part Indian, and judging by his accent, his first language was Spanish. Perry, book in hand as usual, answered the door when he came to their house, and Sylvia, on the way up from her basement apartment to shower, witnessed a small portion of the interchange from the lower stairwell. He held an open briefcase in his brown arms and was using the top half like an easel to display a flyer that said: SEE IT BEFORE YOU NEED IT—BUY BEFORE YOU DIE. His eyes had been locked with Perry’s, but when he heard Sylvia and glanced toward the lower steps, Sylvia stared him down. He blanched and stammered out in accented English, “I’m sorry. I must have the wrong house.” One last, lingering glance at Perry with her precalculus book, and he fled. But Sylvia saw him around the neighborhood weeks afterward, still going from door to door with his briefcase.</p>
<p>And there was the mailman, a thirty-five-year-old creep, who leered at Sylvia because a couple of years ago, before he’d been their mailman, he’d seen her buying condoms when she was getting off work. She hadn’t had anyone to use them with, but it was typical of Sylvia to get the idea to buy condoms just in case. A few months later it paid off when she started going out with her big crush, Brady Hadfield, and had sex on an air mattress in his garage. The next day she smelled of gasoline and was miserably hungover and sore. It hadn’t quite been the tender event she’d envisioned; but she was on a cloud: another rite of passage checked off, another step toward adulthood—sex with a guy she liked. That was what she’d boasted to Perry when Sylvia told her about Brady: “You don’t know really know anything about life until you’ve had sex with someone you love.” Perry, who was just fifteen then, looked up from her perusal of <em>The Fountainhead</em> long enough to ask sarcastically, “So you learned the meaning of life from screwing Brady Hadfield?”</p>
<p>The mailman hadn’t forgotten her or the condoms, and now that he delivered their mail, he treated Sylvia like a slut. But if he encountered Perry, he practically bowed and gave the bundled envelopes into her hands as if she were royalty. He called her “Peregrine” from the name on the recruitment letters she got from colleges. It was because of the mailman’s gossip about the neighbors one day that Mrs. Fitzgerald first wondered if their new home might be Perry’s problem.</p>
<p>“Are we happy here? Do you think it was a mistake to move?” Margaret said the next morning, as she and her husband were getting dressed. She had just pulled up the wooden blinds in the bedroom and was gazing out at the back yard, which was like the back yards of all the other homes around them: muddy. The development was optimistically named Woodland Meadow. There were a few straggling oaks and sweetgums around the edge of it, and a legion of wan-looking seedlings poking out like bristly leg hairs. They were the “woodland,” while the vast expanse of mud was the “meadow.”</p>
<p>The Fitzgeralds had been there six months, long enough to hear the recent stories of which the mailman had reminded Margaret yesterday: Jan Szymanski, on Willow Grove, had gone to bed one afternoon and not gotten up again or bathed until she was finally admitted to a psychiatric hospital. There was the twelve-year-old down the street who’d hanged himself and been found by his cousin; Margaret couldn’t stand to think about that. Or the family of the hospital CEO three blocks over; he’d vanished without a trace, leaving a family of five unsupported and stunned. And McPherson, the hermit widower next door. In the six months they’d been here, his garage door had never once whirred open; his blinds had never been raised. A square of brown paper taped on the interior kept solicitors from peering through the diamond-shaped pane in his front door. The only evidence that he hadn’t joined Mrs. McPherson yet was his environmental consciousness: he put out his beer bottles and newspapers every Tuesday for recycling.</p>
<p>Margaret had heard of whole towns inexplicably riddled by cancer. Here it was morbid depression and malignant agoraphobia. Could there be something undesirable in the ambience—something to do with the tainted history of the subdivision? First there’d been a decade-long feud about zoning. Then the original developer, plagued by cost overruns resulting from the drainage problems, had gone bankrupt during the construction. Subsequently there was a lot of trouble about building codes, and implications of bribery—though they had never been proved.</p>
<p>Now, in answer to Margaret’s speculations, Kevin Fitzgerald said he didn’t think the new house was the problem. He was like Perry: logical. “It’s just hormones,” he said. “She’ll grow out of it. She hasn’t stopped doing her schoolwork, has she?”</p>
<p>“Not yet, anyway,” said Margaret ominously.</p>
<p>It was true. Perry continued to read, sucking in words, inhaling information. She’d always loved to read; she was more than a bookworm; she was obsessed. Lately she’d been into general reference books: dictionaries, encyclopedias, indexes, yearbooks. In one un-Perryish confidence she’d explained her project to Sylvia: “I’m getting ready for the ACT.”</p>
<p>How stupid could you get? thought Sylvia.</p>
<p>Though actually, not so stupid.  It was Sylvia’s poor showing on the entrance exam that had made her decide to apply for the job at Buy-All.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">***</p>
<p>Perry’s pacing, which had begun right after the driving incident, disturbed the whole family, but it bothered Sylvia the most because it was worst in the middle of the day, when Sylvia was trying to sleep. Since moving to the new house, Sylvia slept days and worked nights as a supervisor at Buy-All Discount City.</p>
<p>A narrow strip of Sylvia’s bedroom was under the front hallway. The rest of it was right below the kitchen. Until recently, she’d never had trouble sleeping, and she’d never heard Perry, who was always either at school or quietly studying; if she ever went out, Sylvia didn’t know about it.  But now the sound of Perry’s footsteps as she made the big loop of hallway, living room, kitchen, hallway kept her awake.  It was even louder in the downstairs apartment than it was when you were right in the room with her. Perry often moaned some kind of grievous lament as she paced, but it was hard to understand her emo litany, in which the note of hopelessness was utterly chilling. Sylvia felt bad that the driving lesson had gone so sour, that her little sister had had a shock.  But suck it up,  she thought.  Sylvia had gotten over Brady.  And over screwing up her life by not going to college. Perry was just being ridiculous.</p>
<p>The Fitzgerald parents had no clue what Perry was wailing about. Sylvia, having been present at the driving lesson, knew, but she was still confounded by her sister’s drama. The first time Sylvia heard her sister crying, she thought, Who died? Working nights at Buy-All and eating Pop-tarts in the basement, she sometimes missed things. Had Perry lost a friend or classmate? Was it a relative Sylvia hadn’t heard about?  When she realized that no one had died, Sylvia wracked her brains for an insight. The despair in Perry’s voice instantly made Sylvia think about necrosis, mortality.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">***</p>
<p>The house before the house in Woodland Meadow had cost sixty thousand dollars. It had a mole-infested lawn, a rusty wire fence in back and a row of stunted yews out front. Soon after they sold it and moved “up” to Woodland Meadow, Sylvia transferred to the Buy-All on the south side and started working nights. As supervisor, she was responsible for keeping an eye on the stockers and making sure they got their job done and didn’t steal anything. At Buy-All, the customer was king. Returns were his royal prerogative. This was the philosophy expressed by Clement Byal, founder of Buy-All, in a series of TV ads in which he spoke to the public from his oak-panelled office lined with original oils and Americana.</p>
<p>More often than not, returns had to be sent back to the manufacturer, so it was part of the night supervisor’s job to write them up and ship them off. It was a job she enjoyed because she could vent her creativity. Under the “comments” part of the return form Sylvia could say whatever idiotic thing she liked about the defective item. On dull nights she used rhyme, and if she was really bored, bad puns: <em>Shoe needs glue. Scale weigh off. Bra cup busted. Gloves not very handy.</em></p>
<p>Sometimes, driving home just after dawn, Sylvia reflected on another of her less comfortable duties: to instill in the night crew the platitudinous ideals of Clement (“Clem”) Byal, whose autobiography, <em>Byal</em>, they were all supposed to read. However, Sylvia couldn’t see the connection between abstractions like “excellence,” “accountability,” and “cheerful service,” and the dreary concreteness of slaving for groceries and car payments on the graveyard shift. For that reason, as she piloted her cranky Honda toward Woodland Meadow, she shoved Buy-All to the back of her mind and let her thoughts roam. Occasionally they roamed to the old house with the lumpy lawn, where, in her memory—was it true?—they’d all been happier, and she and Perry had been true sisters. More often they just drifted at random, and from time to time, while in this free-floating state, she had brief glimmers, like the glimmers of heat lightning she sometimes saw in summer, in the morning sky. Pefectly lucid when they flashed through her mind, these flitting notions grew hazy and evaporated by the time she settled down for a day’s sleep. But occasionally one stayed, and crystallized as she snored; and by the time she awakened, it had taken on flesh.</p>
<p><em>Teach Perry to drive</em> one of Sylvia’s glimmers had said—it was soon after the Aztec had knocked on their door. Who cared if her sister didn’t have a permit?  It had come to Sylvia one morning in late July, when the summer humidity was waning. Soon the dawns would be foggy and gray, beautiful in their own way, but not soft and green and freedom-kissed, as they were in summer. Perry really should see this.</p>
<p>Sylvia was getting into bed when she’d heard a car start up outside. <em>With certain kids you have to induce driving. Try the old carrot on a stick.</em> The sound of the motor had made the idea stick. It gelled as she snored, and later that evening she’d gone upstairs to find her sister. “Hey, Perry,” she’d said. “I’ve been thinking about how you’re going to get back and forth to college. . . .”</p>
<p>The following week, on one of Sylvia’s nights off, the two sisters had backed stealthily out of the driveway in Mrs. Fitzgerald’s car. Sylvia wasn’t supposed to drive the Lincoln, but Perry had balked at learning a stick. In the back seat was a sack from the Red Barn that Sylvia had brought along. In it was a bottle of beaujolais, for later—nothing better than seeing the sun rise with a mild buzz on.</p>
<p>Perry, in the driver’s seat, hadn’t known it was there. Sylvia was energized by the sweet deceit that permeated the Lincoln. The engine was turned off; the headlights had been extinguished, so as not to wake their parents. “Here we go!” said Sylvia.</p>
<p>“Shhhh,” Perry had whispered.</p>
<p>“They can’t hear us,” said Sylvia.</p>
<p>“I can hear <em>her</em>.”</p>
<p>And so she could, Sylvia had realized. At that very moment, the stillness was broken by a sound from an upstairs window. Margaret Fitzgerald was singing.  In her sleep?  She never sang while awake now. Sylvia hadn’t heard her mother sing since the old house, where Margaret had sung all the time. She’d hummed and whistled her favorite folk songs, and opened the windows wide in spring and played loud Beethoven on the stereo. What happened to Mom’s music? thought Sylvia.</p>
<p>There were nights at Buy-All when nothing needed returning and there was little stocking to do. Then Sylvia didn’t earn her pay. The inside of the store was an island of florescence in the tar-black pond of the south side of the city. Sylvia was so acclimated to the island that she forgot about the black water, except on slow nights, when she had time to look out the window. Superimposed on the night was the bright reflection of the empty checkouts behind her. After Sylvia had looked out for a while, she would remember her other responsibility—the one that made her uncomfortable. Still, it was part of her job, and she wasn’t without a sense of duty. So she sought out her stockers, and if she found them lazing around, she asked if they’d read <em>Byal</em>. The Buy-All staff were not great readers, and they were annoyed at being told to go to the break room and read. Sylvia had slogged through <em>Byal</em>. <em>From knee-high to a grasshopper, </em>wrote Clem Byal in the opening sentences,<em> I had my heart set on owning a store. Not just any store. A department store, bigger than the downtown Woolworth’s. Kids these days are too doped up to have ambitions. That’s the trouble with this country. That’s why we drug test every single employee before we hire them. Back in the day, things were different. Kids had dreams, ambitions. I started out going door to door, selling laundry soap. And look where it got me. I’m bigger than Woolworth’s. This is the story of how I did it . . .</em></p>
<p>Sylvia felt guilty about making her staff read what wouldn’t do them any good. And that, she’d reflected as she and Perry had rolled onto the street on the night of the driving lesson, was a little bit of what she felt now. All around them was blackness, and there was nothing much she could teach Perry because, as she should have foreseen, Perry already knew how to drive. The minute they were out of the driveway her sister had switched on the ignition. They’d driven along smoothly, no jerking, no nervous swerves. They flashed under a streetlight, then another, then a dark stretch.</p>
<p>“Turn your lights on,” said Sylvia.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” Perry had apologized.</p>
<p>No sooner had their headlights illuminated the well-paved street ahead, than there was the blip of a siren and a light show to their rear. In the affluent subdivision of Woodland Meadow, people who drove around at two in the morning with their lights off were suspicious.</p>
<p>Shit, Sylvia had thought, for there was Perry, unlicensed, at the wheel. But once again her younger sister had known what she was doing. She’d braked expertly, put the car in park and rolled down her window without the slightest hesitation.</p>
<p>The policeman got out of his car and came over.  He looked at the two girls and asked for Perry’s license.</p>
<p>“I’ve got a learner’s permit,” she said, and she pulled it out of her wallet and handed it to him.</p>
<p><em>Now where did she get that?</em> wondered Sylvia.</p>
<p>“Your license too, ma’am,” said the cop to Sylvia.</p>
<p>Minutes later, Sylvia was still searching for her license. There was a little pile of paycheck stubs and gas credit-card receipts beside her on the seat. The driver’s door had somehow been opened, and the policeman squatted next to the car. As was typical, he’d barely acknowledged Sylvia. His whole attention was focused on Perry. Sylvia had seen it before, in the mailman, in the “Aztec” pre-need salesman. Men were idiots for her sister.</p>
<p>“I’m trying to do some advance preparation for college,” Perry had told the policeman when he’d asked where they were going at that hour. He seemed amused but also impressed when she explained. “It’s very time-consuming. My days are pretty full. Do you believe this is the only time I have for driving lessons?”</p>
<p>When Sylvia couldn’t immediately find her license, Perry had pulled out her cell phone. “No reason to just sit around wasting time,” she’d said to the policeman. “I read every minute. If you want to get into a really good college, that’s what you have to do.”</p>
<p>Soon they were looking at something on the Internet—an online academy with lectures about everything from Michelangelo to bacteriology.</p>
<p>“I never heard of this,” the police officer said. His identification said Charles Morton. He’d looked to Sylvia to be twenty-eight or nine.</p>
<p>“I found it,” announced Sylvia, extracting the license from her front pocket, where she’d just remembered she’d stuck it earlier. She withdrew it carefully, the way Brady Hadfield had carefully pulled out of her, holding the condom by its rolled edge. Afterward he’d knotted the open end like an expert and thrown it in the trash barrel. Perry was right. Sylvia hadn’t learned the meaning of life from Brady Hadfield. Maybe if she hadn’t bought the condoms—if she’d had a baby. But she’d been sore and sick, and Brady never called her back. If she’d had it to do over again . . . She didn’t, though, and she wasn’t going to let a Brady Hadfield ruin her life.</p>
<p>Sylvia had handed the license to Officer Morton.</p>
<p>“I better go check this out,” he’d said. He’d disappeared to his car for his laptop. Perry  had continued to stare at her touch screen, quoting bits of trivia from another site she’d lighted on.</p>
<p>“Malawi has a thirty percent literacy rate.”</p>
<p><em>So does Buy-All</em>, thought Sylvia.</p>
<p>When Morton came back, he’d eyed Sylvia with the same look the mailman always gave her. He’d handed the license through the window to Perry, who gave it to her sister. “This car is licensed to your parents?” he’d asked Perry.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“They know about this?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely,” Perry lied.</p>
<p>“Well, girls,” he’d said, “I’m going to let you— Then his gaze had fallen on the paper bag, half open in the back seat.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” he’d said.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">***</p>
<p>In the side yard of the old house with the rusty fence and the yews stood a towering walnut tree, with a board swing on which Sylvia and Perry had sailed through childhood and a good part of adolescence. Before Perry was old enough to pump herself, Sylvia had pushed her, sometimes gently, usually not. She both loved and hated Perry, and when her hatred got the upper hand, she gave her sister a rough, jerky shove. Then, invariably, Perry went flying off the swing and got the wind knocked out of her or skinned her knees.</p>
<p>When she saw her sister hurtling through the air, Sylvia was horror-stricken. Sick with fear that Perry would be killed. And deeply thrilled. But when Perry landed, Sylvia wanted only to run to her and comfort her. She flung herself down on the ground and hugged her sister and cried, too. Afterward, Margaret had trouble figuring out which of her daughters was at fault, especially since Sylvia often fell on the ground so violently that she skinned her own knees. “Who pushed whom?” Mrs. Fitzgerald demanded, slinging up a girl on each hip and lugging them into the house from which Dylan rasped and Beethoven thundered.</p>
<p>Later, Sylvia would ask herself a similar question about the events that followed. Was it her own fault for buying the wine, or Officer Morton’s for telling them to go return it? Or Perry’s for allowing herself to be seduced by the Aztec?</p>
<p>“Want to know where I learned how to drive?” Perry said as they headed to the Red Barn.</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>“From Clem.”</p>
<p>For one crazy minute Sylvia thought she meant Clem Byal.</p>
<p>“Clemente,” explained Perry. “He’s the guy who was selling funeral plans. It’s a good deal.  With a package, you get a complete funeral at a level price.  It will never increase, even if you live sixty more years. And you get to choose it yourself: &#8216;See it before you need it . . .&#8217; Clem really cares about helping people make the plans they want for their ends. It’s the way he talks, the way he looks into your eyes. He’s perfect for pre-need work. He can actually make you see.”</p>
<p>“See what?” Sylvia had asked.</p>
<p>“The end,” said Perry.</p>
<p>“You mean. . . ?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Really?” said Sylvia.  “Who would want to see that?”</p>
<p>Perry shrugged.  “‘See it before you need it.’  It’s not a bad idea.”</p>
<p>And so Sylvia discovered where Perry had learned to drive, and what her secretive sister had been up to every afternoon for the past few weeks, while she’d been asleep. Perry had been driving around suburban Springfield with the Aztec. Sylvia wondered if <em>he</em> was what had somehow infected their subdivision—but no, that was absurd.</p>
<p>“Some people don’t trust Clem because he’s Indian. A lot of times they won’t even answer the door. But I helped him. Once I started going around with him, he was doing better than ever,” said Perry.</p>
<p>“What kind of Indian?” said Sylvia curiously.</p>
<p>“Zapotec. He’s from Mexico.”</p>
<p>Then Sylvia thought of something. “What about birth control?”</p>
<p>Perry blushed.</p>
<p>Which was how Sylvia established that in between the driving lessons and the soliciting, and the visualization of final scenarios, “Clem” had been teaching her sister the meaning of life.  <em>And</em> death.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">***</p>
<p>The night manager of the Red Barn was not quite deformed, but his odd conformation marked him as a jerk. He had bleached hair. Sylvia wondered what had possessed him. Did he think blond would get him laid? He had a sallow, homely, scarred face. “Can I help you?” he snarled, as Sylvia set the bottle on the courtesy booth counter.</p>
<p>“I’ll handle things,” Sylvia whispered to Perry. Perry went off to the all-night bakery for donuts.</p>
<p>“I’m returning this,” said Sylvia to the manager. “It’s not opened.  My sister bought it here, and she’s underage. Officer Morton of the Springfield Police Department assured us you would take it back. Do you need me to fill out a form?” That was the procedure at Buy-All.</p>
<p>The night manager shook his head. He looked at the bottle. All at once he grabbed the screw-cap and twisted.  He looked defiantly at Sylvia. “You opened it!”</p>
<p>“At Buy-All,” Sylvia countered, “we never cheat the customer.”</p>
<p>“This isn’t Buy-All.”</p>
<p>““Don’t dick around with me, Blondie” snapped Sylvia.</p>
<p>The night manager articulated his stance stubbornly: “No returns, no exchanges.”</p>
<p>“Screw you,” sneered Sylvia and grabbed the now open bottle and went off to find her sister.</p>
<p>They were on their way through the OUT door, when the manager grabbed her by the sleeve. “Hold it,” he said. “Do you have a receipt for that?”</p>
<p>There was a struggle. Sylvia lost, and the bottle crashed to the floor and wine flooded the exit.</p>
<p>“Perry!” shouted Sylvia. “Run! I’ll meet you outside!”</p>
<p>But Perry stood like a stone, staring at the IN door, which was opening to admit a tall, handsome, dark-skinned man with long, black hair. A woman accompanied him—red-blonde, like Perry, but thinner and harder. Sylvia had mostly seen Clemente from afar, but from her sister’s expression, she knew it was him. He and the woman were laughing.</p>
<p>“Clem!” said Perry. Her face crumpled, and she started to cry.</p>
<p>Clemente’s gaze went to the wine on the floor.  To Sylvia—who thought she saw a flicker of recognition in his eyes.  To the Red Barn manager. Then he strolled on past, nodding coldly to Perry.  The woman followed, her thin fingers laced in his belt loops.</p>
<p>Ever since, Perry had been keeping Sylvia awake with her pacing and her unintelligible complaint. Sometimes Sylvia caught pieces of it:<em> “I paid. . . .”  “Can’t . . . take. . . .” “. . . thousand”  “. . . . back.” </em> What was that about?</p>
<p>One afternoon as Sylvia was jamming a pillow over her head, her mind lit up.  BUY BEFORE YOU DIE. It was so obvious. She already knew Perry had been driving around with Clem.  She knew he’d seduced her sister.  That Perry had fallen in love—or thought she had.  He was selling, and she was buying: that was it.  She’d “bought” not just his profession of love—she’d bought a funeral, too.  She’d looked into his eyes like all the other suckers; she’d seen her demise, and she’d bought a prepaid funeral with all her money that she never went anywhere except the bookstore to spend. Any dimwit could have figured it out. Why hadn’t Sylvia?</p>
<p>Of course it was still really a man Perry was upset about.</p>
<p>Or was it?</p>
<p>Poor Perry was in denial, thought Sylvia sympathetically—but what was she denying?  Heartbreak?  Betrayal?</p>
<p>Or what had been revealed to her in the Aztec’s eyes?</p>
<p><em>See it before you need it.</em></p>
<p>Soon afterward, on a slow night at Buy-All, Sylvia looked out into the black water at the unpeopled checkouts and felt her blood freeze. Was <em>that</em> what Perry had been wailing about?</p>
<p>Ordering the employees to read <em>Byal</em> that evening, she suddenly believed it would do them good. Because if you could look past all the rants against drugs and gun control, Clem Byal had a valid message: things used to be better.</p>
<p>That same morning, driving home through October fog, her mind wandered to their comfortable old house with the swing in the yard. She could buy it; she’d been saving her money, too. She could get a first-time homebuyers’ loan. Live there with Perry. No Clems, no Bradys. No morbid neighbors, no funeral salesmen, no mud. And when Kevin and Margaret got old, they’d move in with their daughters. It would be like before, only with alternative country out the windows. But when one of them died— Sylvia hoped it would a <em>hundred</em> years from now (and that it wouldn’t be her)—Perry had seen to it that they would be ready.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All along Hotel Street that morning, the men waited in lines for bad whiskey, for tattoos, for their pictures to be taken with the kitschy hula girls.  Last night there had been a brawl at Mom Mabel&#8217;s dance at the Maluhia, and the fight released a restless energy.  At the corner table in Two Jacks’ bar, three Marines lifted the first of their shot glasses.  None of the three had been at Mom Mabel&#8217;s for the fight, but Willard listened as his friends talked about it.</p>
<p>“The Army boys started the fight, is what I heard,” Archie said.  Ever since they boarded the ship in Pendleton four months ago, Willard had heard Archie mouthing off on a range of subjects—Japanese troop movements, the affairs of Hollywood actresses, insider discounts at a Honolulu laundromat.</p>
<p>“One of those army boys cut in during the middle of a dance.”  Archie lowered his voice when he spoke and leaned forward, as though confiding, then shrugged back.</p>
<p>Willard looked across the table at the kid, Frank, who held a full whiskey in mid-air, as if he&#8217;d raised it but forgotten to take a sip.  Willard wondered what Frank thought of Archie, whether he bought the guy&#8217;s crap.  He assumed so.  Archie&#8217;s whole song-and-dance was calculated to impress guys like Frank.</p>
<p>Willard rested his own glass on the table.  The Two Jacks bartender had unlocked the door just minutes earlier, and Willard relaxed into the moment, grateful for the comparative quiet.</p>
<p>“All I’m saying is you got to give the man his time,” Archie said.  He was twenty-two and slippery.  Short and wiry, but with a good-looking face: dark eyes, two huge dimples.  And Archie made Willard laugh.  Not that the guy was funny, necessarily.  But you didn&#8217;t choose your friends in the Marines; you just learned to live with them.  Archie saluted himself with his second whiskey.  Then downed it.   “Hell, as it is you get more time with a three-minute whore than you get with some sorority prude at a goddamned dance.”</p>
<p>Willard rocked his own glass against the stick of the tabletop.  He listened to the soft flat sound of its tapping.</p>
<p>“Not like that sorority tease was gonna give him any.  So what’s the rush?” Archie continued, picking up his third glass.  They had to drink quickly.  The bouncer at Two Jacks was a mean Hawaiian. On a busy day, he’d kick you out as soon as the bartender poured your shots.  He wouldn’t even give you a chance to drink them.  There were so many men in Honolulu now, each place would pour just four drinks per soldier.  After that you had to wait on line at the next bar.</p>
<p>It was still early, before nine, and Two Jacks’ wasn’t too crowded.  Willard looked at the big brown man leaning against the door frame, his arms—laced with tattoos—crossed above the curve of his belly.  A lei seller walked past him and into the bar.  When she approached the first table, her hips swayed away from the drinking soldiers.</p>
<p>Willard saw that the bouncer too was watching her through the slits of his near-shut eyes.  They weren’t going to get kicked out anytime soon.</p>
<p>“The Maluhia’s okay,” Frank said.</p>
<p>Willard looked at him with a curled-lip smirk.  “You’re a sweet kid.  That’s what Evelyn says.”</p>
<p>Frank had met Willard’s wife when they were still in Pendleton, waiting to ship out.  The night before they left, she wore a pink dress that dipped in the back: a sharp, deep V.  Once when she had bent to pick up her purse, Frank had been able to see the back clasp of her bra strap.</p>
<p>“It’s not like I’m going to get a phone number or anything,” he said.  He felt exposed, embarrassed.</p>
<p>The dancing at the Maluhia reminded Frank of parties he had attended as a little kid.  The kind where they played musical chairs.  Except, like everything else in Hawaii, the game had been distorted.  At the Maluhia, when Mom Mabel blew her whistle, only a few men got girls to dance with.  Everyone else stood there with their hands in their pockets, watching the girls’ bodies jitter.</p>
<p>Archie scowled gamely.  “Don’t you know?  Girls’ numbers here are classified.”  Frank felt relieved at this familiar banter.  It was a running joke among the men in their barracks.  Archie, though, had a way of making it sound fresh and clever, like he&#8217;d just dreamed up the routine.</p>
<p>Frank held up his hands.  “So it’s not like you&#8217;re going to get a date.  You might as well try your hand at the Maluhia,” he said. “What else is there to do?”</p>
<p>Willard shrugged and swallowed half a shot.  Beyond Willard&#8217;s shoulder, Frank saw the lei seller bend over the men at a nearby table.  By now, she had worked her way around the perimeter of the bar, the space long and narrow as a hallway.  Her dress tugged against her skin, and he was aware that Archie also turned to watch her.</p>
<p>“Hey, Sweetheart,” Archie called to her.  She was holding her armful of purple leis up for the men at the next table.  She glanced up and smiled at him.</p>
<p>“You like to buy?”  She strolled the four steps over to their table.  Frank saw that the baggy floral of her dress bunched over two tiny tits; he could hardly even tell they were there.</p>
<p>“Yeah, Sweetheart.  I’d like to buy you dinner,” Archie said.</p>
<p>She looked over her shoulder, checking for the big Hawaiian by the front door.  He  followed her with his sleepy eyes, still as a pregnant sea lion sunning.</p>
<p>“Leis cost seventy-five cents,” she told them, and as she spoke, Frank realized she couldn&#8217;t be more than fifteen.</p>
<p>“Sounds like a bargain,” Archie said.  “I’d have paid five dollars just for your phone number.”</p>
<p>“Oh come on now,” Willard said to the girl, “he won’t take that long.  You ought to give him a discount.”</p>
<p>Archie laughed and shook his head at the table.  He tilted back onto the hind chair legs and propped his hands back behind the base of his skull in a way that seemed to Frank off-kilter.</p>
<p>“Say, ten cents a second,” Willard continued.  He spoke carefully, as though he was performing a mathematic calculation.  “He’ll owe you twenty, twenty-five cents tops,” he said, now smirking.  The girl turned again to the bouncer.</p>
<p>“He’ll be done before you’ve finished with his zipper.”</p>
<p>“Won&#8217;t inconvenience you or anything,” Archie said.  But he had stopped laughing, and Frank noticed that his smile had turned into something different, snarling.  Archie rocked his front chair legs onto the ground and snapped forward.  His feet slapped the floor alongside her.</p>
<p>Now the bouncer caught her eye, and unrolled his giant arms; they were like two cannons.<br />
“It’s alright, Sweetheart,” Willard said.  “We’re only playing.”</p>
<p>She held the leis up higher around her waist, so they covered her like a second coat of clothing.  When Frank looked up at her, he saw her bite her lip before she left their table.</p>
<p>“See, what’d I tell you?” Archie said with a sort of jocular triumph.  “Classified.  So what should we do?”</p>
<p>Frank reached for his untouched second whiskey, then fingered the rim of the glass.   When the pale liquid sloshed against his skin, he put the glass down and nudged it away with his index finger.  “Let’s go see Ecstasy again,” he said.</p>
<p>The three men had gone to see the film at the Paradise movie palace off Hotel Street during their last liberty.  Sometimes, Frank still saw Hedy Lamarr’s bare chest appearing in his field of vision at unexpected moments – in the mess hall, or when he first opened his eyes in the barracks&#8217; bunk room in the mornings: her dark gray nipples.  “That girl is smooth,” he said.</p>
<p>“She’s not bad,” Archie said.  “Except that half the time she’s naked you’re looking at her through a puddle.”</p>
<p>But the truth was that during that entire sequence of the movie Archie, along with all the other men in the theater, had let out a revolving stream of whistles and cheers.  “Oh!” they’d shouted and slapped their thighs when her elbows covered her face.</p>
<p>“Besides, I’m not half drunk,” Archie said now, holding his last empty glass in his upturned hand like a pair of dice.</p>
<p>“Trade Winds?” Willard said.</p>
<p>Frank swallowed his last two shots back-to-back.</p>
<p>“Whoa boy,” Archie said, watching him.  “Alright, Trade Winds.  Let’s go.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the way, they passed an arcade.  All up and down the block the sound of pinging echoed, as tempting as the smell of movie theater popcorn.  Inside the arcade, men played pinball and Pachinko.  They stood with their legs apart, or rested their weight on one hip, listless and casual.  The arcade reminded them of the bright red Grip Scale Strength Testers in their local bars and barbers or – for men like Archie – of Coney Island or the Jersey Shore.</p>
<p>“Let’s shoot Hitler’s head off,” Archie said.</p>
<p>Frank peered into the dim cavern of the arcade.  He’d grown up in a small Minnesota town, so small that for something to do he and his buddies used to pile into one car or another at night and drive up and down the empty Main Street, past the darkened stores, running red lights across vacant intersections.  As they drove, they’d lean their heads out the windows and shout.  When the war started, this was why he’d joined: he thought he’d rather die of anything than boredom.  Except that the war had proven to be nothing but boring.  He watched Archie disappear into the dark arcade.  His entire life was waiting.</p>
<p>“Guess we might as well,” he said to Willard.  “I wouldn’t mind blowing out some brains.  At least it’d be a change.”</p>
<p>He handed over a dime to the cashier, a balding Chinese woman with a fat, drooping jaw.  “Eight shot,” she said and pushed a slingshot across the dirty glass of the counter.</p>
<p>Frank had been a good marksman in basic training.  He hadn’t known that about himself until then, and it was at once a relief and a challenge.  He had something to prove, and he’d half-proved it.  Now he pulled back the slingshot and aimed it at the cartoon Hitler, with his two black-and-white rimmed eyes, actually two miniature, spring-loaded targets mounted behind the plywood head.  Frank shot out the left eye target with the slingshot marble, then aimed for the right.  He missed it twice.  This made him angry, and he knew when he was angry he lost focus.  He stepped back and wiped his face with the back of his arm, the thin hairs already matted with sweat.  It was nine A.M. and hot as hell in Hawaii.</p>
<p>He made his next two shots, shooting out Hitler’s eyes once each.  But then he missed the next one.</p>
<p>“Aw, too high,” Willard said behind him.</p>
<p>Frank turned around.  “I got it.”  Underneath his mustache, Hilter’s cartoon lips pursed together, like a barely repressed smile.  “You bastard,” Frank said.  It was meant to be a joke, but he suddenly felt angry again, and, as was typical now, the anger spread out over everything, became vague and general.  He wasn’t angry at Hitler or Willard staring over his shoulder, or at the futile goddamned slingshot.  He was mad at all of them, and at the balding Chinese lady, and at the relentless pinging pinball, and at himself standing there in the middle of it all just taking it.</p>
<p>He aimed the slingshot up in the air and snapped the rubber strings, propelling the marble up and over the Hitler game, and down again five feet over, where it hit the Batter Up and bounced, cracking the game’s glass cover.</p>
<p>He turned around and glared at Willard.  “How you like that?” he asked, and the question felt bold, triumphant.</p>
<p>But Willard shook his head and took the final marble from Frank’s fist.  “I’d say that’s enough,” he said.</p>
<p>He led the way over to the dirty counter, and Frank handed the Chinese lady back the slingshot.  She shook her finger in Frank’s face.  “You don’t come back here.”  She looked at Willard. “You understand me?  He don’t come back.”</p>
<p>Willard pulled Frank into the bright sunlight.  “Well, that was slick.”  They stood there in silence in the sunlight and waited for Archie to come out.  “You’re all wet.  You know that?  You’re a real prick.”</p>
<p>Standing next to Willard made Frank feel childish.  Before he&#8217;d left for training, Frank’s father had driven him to the train station.  It was raining.  He’d never forget that.  Main Street empty, dark except for the street lights and the traffic signals, which flickered against the windows.  His father hadn’t said a word, and Frank had looked out and watched the shapes of the pharmacy and the bank as they passed by.  When they got to the platform, Frank’s father held an umbrella over them, and shook Frank’s hand.  “Well, son, good luck.”  And it seemed like such a letdown, that moment, so much less than it was meant to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Trade Winds the bartender poured each of the men their four allotted three-count shots.  Willard watched Frank drink the first and second shots, then cradle the third, untouched, between his palms.  The three of them were sitting at the corner of the bar.  Behind them men lined up, the bar growing increasingly hot.  Even inside, it smelled like fish.</p>
<p>Before they shipped out Evelyn had said to Willard that she’d bet anything Frank had never been laid.  “He looks like he’s ready to come every time I shake his hand,” she said.</p>
<p>Willard snorted.  “That’s hilarious.”</p>
<p>But then Evelyn put down her sunglasses.  “No it’s not.”  She twiddled with the seashell purse they’d bought that day at a shop in town.  “Poor kid.”</p>
<p>Willard admired the white undersides of Evelyn’s tanned wrists.  Alone in their room, she’d take off her clothes, and Willard could see the white skin where her bathing suit had been.  He ran his tongue along this naked clothing, the phantom white bathing suit straps, her tits like two exposed light bulbs, the strips of white skin between her brown legs and her pussy.  How was he going to get by without her?</p>
<p>“Poor kid?” he said.  “Poor me.”</p>
<p>“He’s only eighteen,” she said.</p>
<p>But Willard always felt this, how young Frank was, whenever they were together.  Willard had waited to enlist until the last possible second, until he knew without a doubt he’d be drafted anyway.  By that time, he was already twenty-six.  Now he was twenty-eight and among the oldest of the enlisted men in his unit.  The rest of them were boys.</p>
<p>When they first got to Honolulu they’d walk past the stands with all the nudey pictures and Frank would look at them open-mouthed, and then quickly look away.  Willard shouldn’t have yelled at him outside the arcade, he knew that.  He looked around at the line of men behind them at the bar.  Another couple minutes and they’d be kicked out.</p>
<p>“Let’s go get Frank laid,” he said.</p>
<p>Frank drank half of his third whiskey, and then looked down into the remaining seasick liquid in his glass.  “Why me?” he said, watching the liquid slosh.  He swallowed the rest and then slid the glass out of reach and looked up.</p>
<p>“Why not?” Willard said.</p>
<p>“Hey, I’m game,” Archie said.  “I haven’t been to the Bronx in months.  There’s a real hot number over there, a real blackout girl if you know what I mean.”</p>
<p>“Sure,” Willard said.  “The Bronx’s as good as anywhere.”  Among Hotel Street’s brothels, the Bronx Rooms and the Senator Hotel were the largest and most popular.</p>
<p>Archie raised his whiskey.  “I figure it’s where I got laid back home, might as well be where I get laid here.”  He laughed.</p>
<p>“As long as Frank gets some, it doesn’t matter to me where we go.”</p>
<p>“Hey, hold up now.  What’s this ‘Frank gets some’ business?”  Frank drank his final whiskey and looked back and forth between the men.</p>
<p>“You tell us,” Willard said.</p>
<p>“I can get some if I want to, I just haven’t.”</p>
<p>“Everyone wants to get some,” Willard said.  “You just don’t have the balls to do it.”  He passed Frank one of his shots and drank the other one.  “Today’s your day, my friend.  Today’s the day.”</p>
<p>“Let me tell you guys, there’s this girl there you aren’t going to believe.  A real Sheba,” Archie said and slapped Frank on the back.</p>
<p>Out on Hotel Street men in white and khaki lined the sidewalk on both sides of the road.</p>
<p>“It’s past ten,” Archie said as they walked toward the Bronx.  “We’re going to be waiting on line for hours.”</p>
<p>The three men walked all the way to the Bronx’s entrance before they saw that the line started a block over and around the corner.  They backtracked.</p>
<p>“We should just go somewhere else,” Frank said.  “Or come another time.”</p>
<p>“Eh, it’s going to be the same anywhere,” Archie said.  “Hey, you’ve waited long enough.  Another couple hours won’t kill you.”</p>
<p>Archie looked at the line of men ahead of them.  He’d been to the Bronx Rooms once before, shortly after they arrived in Hawaii.  Now he shoved his hands in his pockets and shifted his weight.  It had been – he didn’t know how to say what it had been like.  Besides, it was better than nothing, he figured.  Better than Hedy Lamarr in a middle distance blur, running across the screen at the Paradise.</p>
<p>But he’d expected something – some exotic difference – a lei girl wrapped in flowers, one of the hula girls from the photo booths, him parting the stiff green grass skirt.  He’d heard the usual rumors about the photo booth hula girls – offer them twenty dollars and you can have them for the night.  Offer it to the photo booth man, some of the guys said.  He’d arrange it.  But Archie had asked once, and had been told to get lost, you haole creep.  He’d asked in such a soft voice he hardly recognized it as his own, leaning in towards the photo guy, Hey is she, you know, available… He’d been too embarrassed to wait for the answer, which came anyway, shouted out after him as he turned off down the street.  For all he knew, the guy had been her brother.  Or her husband or something.  Heck, guy could’ve been her father: all those Hawaiians looked about the same.</p>
<p>Instead, at the Bronx, Archie found what all the men in Honolulu discovered in the Hotel Street brothels: San Francisco hookers shipped across the Pacific for a six month stint that had lasted three years, thanks to the wartime travel restrictions.  Women he might just as easily have met back home in New York if he’d had to resort to such things then.  No, in New York he never had this problem, he’d been planning to enlist, a fact that he whispered to the girls he dated, in the back seats of the city buses.  This whispered intention brought enough gratitude – or sympathy or patriotism or dangerous thrill, whatever it was, he didn’t much care – to get him a good hour of necking, or, once, on the actual bus – God, he still couldn’t believe it – his hand in between the buttons of a girl’s blouse, their wool coats screening them from view.  And – once he did enlist – he was shipping out, he told them.  Men were so scarce by the time Archie turned eighteen that sometimes older women, working girls, would invite him to the apartments they shared with roommates in Manhattan or New Jersey.</p>
<p>Archie’s experience at the Bronx in Honolulu had made him feel desperate and ordinary, like he was no more or less than the hundred other men ahead of him and behind him on line.  What bothered him about Hedy Lamarr was her coming on screen, the forearms over her face.  It wasn’t part of sex here, not in Honolulu.</p>
<p>Archie slapped Frank on the back again.  He turned to the men directly behind him in the line.  “Kid here’s gonna make it.”  The group of four Navy boys cheered, “Wooo wee!” and exchanged punches on the arm with Archie and Willard and Frank.  The Navy boys were even drunker, their punches seldom landing.  “This is it,” one of them shouted.  “This is what it’s all about.”</p>
<p>Frank stood in the bright, hot sun, sobering.  He wanted to leave, to go into some quiet, dark room where he could be alone.  And just as strongly, he wanted to be inside that brothel.  He imagined a cool room with a ceiling fan, a woman’s silk nighty falling.  What he really imagined, what he’d imagined since before they left, was Evelyn taking off her low-backed dress, or Dorothy Hammond, whom he’d dated in high school, lying bare-legged on the plaid blanket by the lake.</p>
<p>By the time the three men got to the front of the line, and Willard and Archie were admitted into the brothel, Frank’s head was a heavy, dull buzz.  Behind him, the Navy boys were passing a flask back and forth among the four of them, increasingly indiscreet.  One leaned forward and rested his crossed arms on Frank’s shoulders.  Then he hugged Frank, a groping, dizzy gesture.  “This is what it’s all about,” the Navy boy said; then, off-key, like a sing-song boast, “God bless America.”</p>
<p>Frank shrugged to try to get him off, but the man stayed, resting his bleary chin on Frank’s shoulder, his breath heavy and pungent.  Frank felt his stomach churn.  Finally the man reeled back a pace, staggering into his friends.</p>
<p>“I’m going to get laaaa-eeed,” he called out, his voice inflected like a police siren.</p>
<p>“He’s too drunk.  He can’t come in,” the woman who kept the door of the Bronx told the Navy men behind Frank.</p>
<p>The three Navy boys looked at their friend and then each other.  “Oh, come on,” one of them said.  “We’ve been waiting hours.”</p>
<p>“Look at him,” the Hawaiian woman said.  “He won’t be able to make business even if I do let him in.”</p>
<p>“Hey there, you better watch it,” one of the other Navy boys said.</p>
<p>And the intoxicated Navy boy shouted, “What’chu sayin to me?”</p>
<p>“You’re too drunk,” the woman said, her syllables slow and impatient.</p>
<p>“I’m not too drunk,” he slurred.  “I’ll show you.”  He ran forward, landing heavily on the sides of his feet, until he was practically nose-to-nose with the woman.  He pointed his chin toward the inside of the brothel.  “I&#8217;ll show ’er.”</p>
<p>“Haole, you just try,” she said, her voice full of threat and humor.</p>
<p>“Let me at’er,” the Navy boy said, his hand over the side pocket of his white pants.  He slipped the hand inside, and it re-emerged half a second later with a standard-issue pocket knife.  He fumbled with the blade, unfolding it clumsily, then holding it up and waving it in a haphazard pattern by her face.</p>
<p>Here it was: the rumbling aftershock of the Maluhia fight.  The tension the men had lived with all morning, concentrated here in this ludicrous moment: the drunk boy, the flailing knife, the woman just starting to laugh; and then, as the Navy boy’s friends yanked his arms back, pulled him away, out into the street, then down it, the tension was diffused back out, absorbed into the crowd of men.</p>
<p>The woman turned her head after the Navy boys for a minute, and then faced Frank.  “Your turn,” she said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the top of the stairs, Frank handed the lady behind the cashier’s cage three one dollar bills.  She didn’t look up at him, just dragged the money back, and shoved a poker chip at him.  It was red with white squares spaced out around the edges.  Frank picked it up and put it in his pocket, keeping his fingers on it to make sure it wouldn’t somehow slip out and roll away.</p>
<p>He located Willard and Archie among the men that packed the benches on either side of the dim hall.  Archie was leaned back, the crown of his head against the wall, his chin up, pointing to the ceiling.  Willard sat with his hands on his knees, watching his shoe tap the floor.</p>
<p>Frank sat down next to him.  “You doing this too?” he asked.</p>
<p>Willard nodded.  “Might as well.”  He had never been unfaithful before this, but even that word, unfaithful, seemed so foreign here, so out of place.</p>
<p>Frank leaned back against the wall.  The hallway smelled like must and alcohol.  He closed his eyes and waited.  Willard disappeared into a room on the left side of the hall, and Archie into a room on the right.  Then Frank was summoned.  A woman in a gray dress, one of the maids, ushered him into a cubicle.  “Wait here,” she said.  She held out her hand for Frank’s token.  “Take off all your clothes.”</p>
<p>Frank let his eyes adjust to the light, which blinked from a bare bulb located on the other side of a plywood partition that only went part-way to the ceiling, like a bathroom stall.  There were partitions on either side of the trick room, and from one side Frank heard a man groan.  Could it be Archie? he wondered.  He got undressed, and sat down on the narrow cot, crossing his arms over his penis.</p>
<p>On the other side of the wall, the voice shouted, “Oh Mamma, oh God.”  Frank looked away to the partition on the opposite side.  He wanted to put on his pants, but he felt rooted, unable to move.</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s get going.”  A woman entered the room so fast Frank hadn’t had time to expect her coming.  “Come here.”  She waved her wrist to signal him, and stood by the washbasin in the corner, her other hand waiting on her hip.</p>
<p>He walked over and she reached down and grabbed his penis, pulled back the foreskin.  He was hard in a second; it alarmed him, and he felt an involuntary leap in his throat, like gagging.  The woman – she was naked except for a short synthetic robe, which hung from her shoulders; the tie was missing – sunk a washcloth in the basin water, then rubbed it over Frank’s penis.  Frank thought for a minute he might come right then, into the warm terrycloth, like he had so many times back home in the privacy of the shower.  But he held out, bit into the sides of his cheeks.</p>
<p>The woman bent down – Frank could see the dandruff at the roots of her thin brown hair – and held Frank between her hands.  “We’re gonna do it like this, okay?” she said and then put her tongue onto the tip of Frank’s penis.  But he shook his head, then found his voice, a loud crackling, “No.”  He remembered their commanding officer telling them after drills once that letting a girl take you in her mouth was one step away from queer.</p>
<p>She shrugged and stood up again, letting herself drag a bit.  “Okay.”  She pushed against his shoulder, propelling him back a step towards the edge of the cot.  Her arms were gaunt and scraggly.  She lay down and held onto Frank’s wrists, pulling him down on top of her, then put one hand on each side of his buttocks and tugged him forward, inside.  He felt the slow warm heat like being dizzy.  But he wasn’t reacting fast enough. She was grinding against him, flexing and squeezing, moving her cunt in tiny, excruciating circles.</p>
<p>“Wait,” he said.</p>
<p>But even as he said it he felt the release, the involuntary coming; her body slid out from under him.</p>
<p>He’d been inside her just over a minute.</p>
<p>“Okay,” she said, and adjusted her robe, tugging it back up over her shoulders.</p>
<p>Frank pressed his face against the rough sheet.  When he turned around again she was gone.</p>
<p>The maid stood in the doorway, took a quick, uninterested glance at his naked body.  “Get dressed now,” she said.  She clapped her hands, two crisp sounds like gunshots.  “Other guys are waiting.”</p>
<p>Frank put on his khaki uniform, still damp from the long wait outside under the midday sun.  Outside he found Willard and Archie waiting; they cheered him when he stepped out the brothel door.  The other men still waiting in line caught on and cheered too.  They released a broad, sweaty stink.  “You fuck, it proves you can fight,” his commanding officer had said.  Frank swallowed, felt the raw tightness still in his throat.</p>
<p>“What now?” Archie said.  “You still want to see Ecstasy?”</p>
<p>Frank squeezed his eyes shut, and then looked down the block in the other direction, away from the line of GIs.  He caught sight of the tattoo parlor down the street.  Over the past few months, he’d seen some of the other men in the unit come back from liberty with matching tattoos: bald eagles and American flags.  A couple times he&#8217;d taken their pictures afterward, and they would all stand in a close row, their biceps flexed, smiling.</p>
<p>Frank watched the needle in the steady hand of the Filipino teenager, the letters emerging painfully on his arm.  He and Archie had picked the same one; three dollars apiece.  “Remember Pearl Harbor” it would say, like a battle cry or a promise.</p>
<p>“You getting ‘Remember Pearl Harbor’ too?” Archie asked Willard.</p>
<p>“Nope,” Willard said.  “I’m getting ‘Evelyn.’”  He looked at the  lined, loose-leaf pages displayed on the counter.  The Filipino had sketched his designs in thick, blurry ink.  Willard ran his finger across the hand-drawn images.  “With a heart.”</p>
<p>“Heart costs a dollar extra,” the Filipino boy said.</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s okay.”</p>
<p>Only later would Willard realize that he had made a mistake.  Only when he was lying in his bed in the barracks.  Or—even later—manning a machine gun amid the carnage on an Okinawa beach.  Only then did Willard realized that the tattoo, which was supposed to mean one thing, instead reminded him of everything else.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dust had spread over the shanty like its children across the continent.  A spurned bridal veil tossed to the altar, it settled in eddies over bone-colored cedar left to the weather.  Boots without men, dry and cracked in their skin, nested mice in the corner.  A sawdust palliasse huddled next to a wood stove with a wind-rattled stack looking like a shriveled kidney holstered to a rheumatoid spine.  Leaves brown and brittle long fled from their makers left emaciated sentries too thin to stand against the snow that would soon slip unwanted through the threshold.  Even now the chill pushed the fallen and departed laurels of autumn hobbling to the hot stove.</p>
<p>“You won’t come with me?”</p>
<p>“No, Hosea, I ain’t.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be back then, God willing.”</p>
<p>“They ain’t no God in the west.”</p>
<p>Not a full night later he rode out under a gray dawn on a young jack.  Furious flakes blew in like bloated dog ticks.  Their kin plucked from the lakes to the north followed in white bands that could have been the folds in the chiffon peignoir of a great strumpet sitting upon the waters.  Hosea escaped her long embrace, but it covered his trail and wrapped the shanty of his brother in her arms.</p>
<p>The winter was soft and snowy when he saw the tall-lunged factories of Pittsburgh.  They sketched in the sky like charcoal sticks in the hands of a maiden white in her wedding gown.  He baptized an asthmatic breaker boy who shivered back to the banks blinking away coal dust washing down in dirty streams.  He boarded a paddle wheeler where the Allegheny knew the Mon to beget the Ohio.  He rode it to the Mississippi where he took the Muddy Belle to the Arkansas and a steamer captain named Diblaim carried him up into the west and tried to buy his jack when they docked in Indian Country out in Oklahoma.</p>
<p>Freezing drizzle clung in clear wrinkles to the trees and barns up in Winfield.  The jack ate from the manger and Hosea lay in the hay listening to the ice amputate limbs like a cruel Kansas surgeon making eunuchs of the cottonwoods.  He rode out to Dodge into a northwest wind that chapped his face like the icy breath of bellows feeding an undying fire.  Another stranger’s stable kept him from the night and he brushed away the grainy dust from his hair and rode his jack into Dodge under a cold day’s dawn.</p>
<p>Golden strips of clouds hung over the sun like copper tubes over a flame-kissed whiskey still.  Steam-trumpet cries railroaded the empty Sunday morning and a woman with a cigar in sweat-stained satin roared from the Dry Creek Saloon with her prey.  Kodiak hands flung down naked bones by the hair, broke an opium pipe across her jaw, and kicked a hole in her head with a Colt.</p>
<p>The woman bent down and crushed out her cigar on the dead pubescent cheek.  She looked up at the man on his jack and she had the grizzly shadow of a post-menopausal moustache.  “A body’s gotta keep clean.”</p>
<p>“I will.”</p>
<p>“Your leg’s wet.”</p>
<p>Hosea found a stall for his jack at the livery and a room for himself next door.  From his window he could see ten-thousand fallen prairie angels stacked to be shipped from the buffalo hide yard and he watched the train masters come to town passing through the night like priests of Aphrodite with their consecrated red caboose lanterns.  One of the celebrants studied with Hosea after his wife left with his sons, but he never could quit dancing in the fairy ring of warts that had sprung up under his handlebars like little grassy hills on a lonely rainy plain.</p>
<p>Late one April evening when the Full Pink Moon had risen like a pale cherry pearl and the wildflowers had begun to wake in the pent-up loins of spring, a blooming girl in auburn curls brought Hosea his supper.  She smiled like a child with the eyes of a lady, kind and soft like the gentle wash of a watercolor amid the heavy-brushed acrylics.  She wore lace with a whisper of perfume and she blushed in the doorway of his room with her offering.</p>
<p>“Courtesy of the Madam.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t order of the Madam.”</p>
<p>“She wants to know if you think you’re too good for her.”</p>
<p>“I greet her every time I see her.”</p>
<p>“You never come to the Dry Creek.”</p>
<p>“That’s because she has big hands.”</p>
<p>She laughed.  “My name’s Jenny.”</p>
<p>“Mine’s Hosea.”</p>
<p>“You ever eat buffalo tongue?”</p>
<p>“Not on purpose.”</p>
<p>“The Madam never skins it, but if you peel it, you’ll like it.  I promise.”</p>
<p>Not long after not finishing the peeled tongue, Hosea rode his jack out to the deep creek where he made his baptistery just off the sand bar.  He sat alone on the rocks like an overseer outside of Potiphar’s by the Nile.  He talked to his jack as the donkey drank in the face of the full rippling moon and he mused on what nymphs and sirens must have been perched amid the rocky beds of the Dry Creek.</p>
<p>When the rains came the men laid boards in the streets between the saloons.  Their feet felt cold in the wet leather wearing mud and they warmed themselves with fast prancing pianos and laughing young girls worn like buffalo bladders dried into whiskey jugs.  King Charles of the hearts scaled a bluff of notes and coins to slay young Lancelot, that knave of clubs and thief of kingdoms, then men stood accused before quick-trigger judgments and Hosea almost always started from his pillow when their ivory-grip gavels fell.  Yet he woke and walked every morning and the Madam was awake then too.</p>
<p>“Good morning.”</p>
<p>“Back to town already?”</p>
<p>“I got an early start today.”</p>
<p>“I keep thinkin’ I’m gonna see you with Jenny some mornin’.”</p>
<p>“She’s joined me before.  There’s a dole of doves we like to watch down by the creek.”<br />
“But not lately.”</p>
<p>“Not lately.”</p>
<p>“Soiled doves don’t get up that early do they.”</p>
<p>The midsummer song of cicadas called forth their mates and descended dancing on the town like Dionysian maenads glistening wet in the light of the moon.  Jenny and Hosea and his jack walked in the lush pastures at dusk and talked of David the King and Samson the Judge and Balaam that scourge of jennies and sower of harlots.  In the cool October afternoons they sat under a Jonathan tree and watched the jack graze on grass and apples like a peaceful pack animal retired to his rest.</p>
<p>It was late one cold November night while Jenny bemoaned beneath the blankets and Hosea dreamt within his fleece that between them in the street a well-liquored Winchester cut up its meat no better than a butcher’s knife gone dull.  Jenny played enraptured with her work and Hosea hurried out to the aching braying bleeding in the dirt.  His donkey was staggering – shot in the gut and the neck and a man whipped the jack in the head with his gun before Hosea tackled him and threw away the Winchester.</p>
<p>“That’s my donkey!”</p>
<p>“It ain’t – ain’t no more.”</p>
<p>“Oh no…  Oh no no no.”  The donkey slumped to his forelegs and Hosea saw in the street the man he had seen over Scripture.  “Wh– why?  Why’d you do this – why?”</p>
<p>“‘Cause he was cheatin’.  Ain’t no way he coulda had another six – ain’t no way.”  The donkey was braying, trying to get to his feet.  “An’ ain’t no way he was gettin’ that jack either – ain’t no way.”</p>
<p>Hosea was crying.</p>
<p>The Madam came and shot the jack in the head.  “Let’s go back inside.  Better luck next hand.”</p>
<p>“But I ain’t – I ain’t got no more left to bet.”</p>
<p>“You bet the jack, didn’t you?  Now come on.  There’s always somethin’ left to bet.”</p>
<p>“But he’s cheatin’.  He’s cheatin’ me.”</p>
<p>“I ain’t gonna let him cheat you into leavin’.”</p>
<p>“But I–”</p>
<p>“Come on.  Jus’ stay with me an’ you’ll be alright.  Come on now.  That’s it.  Let’s go have ourselves another hand.”</p>
<p>That night a hard freeze sculpted countless ice sarcophagi over every blade of grass.  Jenny crunched the dead under boot as she carried a shovel outside of town and met Hosea in the dawn.  Neither had slept.  A procession of ice pellets passed on the north wind and they dug the cold ground like forgotten miners in a broken shaft.  The ice turned to rain and then to freezing rain in the afternoon and evening and they walked back to Hosea’s room and he carried Jenny’s shovel and held her hand.</p>
<p>“I’m leaving on the morning train.”</p>
<p>“You can’t give up.”</p>
<p>“I’ve planted and watered.  Now God must give the increase.”  He reached for her hand.  “I want you to come with me.”</p>
<p>She nodded, tearing up.</p>
<p>“We’ll look for your father.  We’ll see if he’s still a captain.”</p>
<p>“He’ll die a paddle wheeler.”</p>
<p>“We’ll find him.”</p>
<p>“I want to bring my sister.”</p>
<p>“Your sister?”</p>
<p>“The Madam tells them we’re sisters.”</p>
<p>“She’ll try to stop you.”</p>
<p>“There’s always a way of escape.”</p>
<p>“I’ll help you.”</p>
<p>“We’ll meet you at the station.”  She wiped her eyes and kissed him and stood to leave.  “I may be alone or late, but I’ll be there.”</p>
<p>Hosea waited alone in the dark near the platform.  Men loaded smoked buffalo tongues into train cars and red caboose lanterns bobbed out of Dodge like hungover fireflies swaying out of season.  The stoker stood ready near his great coal mountain like a bargeman in the headwaters to a blistering hot lake and still Hosea turned not to the train.  Out of sight below the horizon the dawn began to overthrow the night.  The hour waxed late and the steam trumpet sounded in a twinkling – but it called like the herald of a distant shadow with what could have been blood and baggage making its approach for the morning train.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the early morning sunlight, the pockets of calm water across the Rock River shone like wet spots on a drying canvas. From a lawn chair in her backyard, Maya watched a heron toil up from the riverbank—its shadow blooming into blue, gray, and yellow on the muddy water—and settle on petiole legs in a nearby estuary. Two deliverymen had just left an enormous crate on her front porch. Maya knew it held a birthday present from her father.</p>
<p>Maya’s father—a renowned taxidermist—had mounted many extinct and endangered fish. Last year, he’d moved from Oregon, Illinois to the jungles of southern Laos with Lae, a twenty-four-year-old Lao art student who’d become one of his assistants. He sent Maya letters from Chiang Khong, a small Thai city near the Lao border. Though she’d just turned thirty, still worked at the Oregon Public Library, and envied her father and Lae’s view of the Mekong River and Sayphou Louang Mountains from their back porch, Maya tried to appreciate the Rock River and the local herons.</p>
<p>Maya’s father’s mounts of extinct and critically endangered fish were displayed in museums across the world. Years ago, on winter mornings when he wouldn’t leave his studio to come outside and make snow angels, Maya and her mother drove to Chicago and wandered the Field Museum. In one dark roomy hall, ten of his mounts filled a small glass case. “See these?” Maya’s mother would ask. “These are what Daddy paints when he’s upstairs.” Engraved in small gold plates beneath the fish were names as beautiful, evocative, and forlorn as his renderings: Raycraft Ranch Poolfish, Grass Valley Speckled Dace, Ginger Pearlfish, Opal Allotoca.</p>
<p>When Maya was ten, her mother moved to New Mexico with the manager of a 7-Eleven. Maya had sat in her bed and reread the letters her mother sent. She traced the words, her hand where her mother’s had been, and imagined what her mother had been thinking as she’d written each one. Occasionally she crumpled a letter and squeezed it between her palms until her hands trembled. The image of a frog, deer, or eagle she and her mother had spotted along the river sometimes appeared like a fossil in the wrinkled, crushed paper, and Maya untwisted and smoothed the letter until it felt like cloth.</p>
<p>After her mother left, Maya’s father spent two months mounting a six-foot-long bluefin tuna. He invited Maya into his studio and told her stories about catching bluefin on the Atlantic with his uncle. One morning he woke her. “Sweetheart,” he’d said, “it’s complete!” The bluefin’s back was a brilliant coral-blue. Its iridescent silver-purple sides seemed plated with clam shells. Two dorsal fins rose from its smooth, torpedo-shaped body. The first was a shimmering yellow; the second, a glossy neon red. Maya hugged her father, told him she’d never seen anything so beautiful, and dreamed they’d grow as close as she and her mother had been.</p>
<p>A rowboat carrying a young man and woman appeared beside the estuary, and Maya opened the <em>National Geographic</em> magazine in her lap. She felt funny just watching the river and knew she’d say or do something clumsy if she acknowledged the couple. As the rowboat neared her, and as the couple was probably waiting for her to look up and greet them, Maya caught herself rubbing the back of her neck—one of her nervous habits. Had she just revealed how anxious they made her? She pretended to be captivated by an article she’d read earlier about how Earth was so unique because life on most other planets—which didn’t stay in habitable zones or contain certain elements or have moons that deflected meteors—could never evolve into anything more complex than microbes.</p>
<p>Maya hoped the couple didn’t think she was rude. Almost involuntarily, she looked up to say hello just as the boat passed by and saw a teenage girl and boy leaning back in their seats and staring at the clouds. The girl held a neon green thermos. A tea bag envelope fluttered above the thermos like a tiny kite. The girl whispered something to the boy and he laughed. Maya looked down at the magazine. A photo of a cat-shaped crater in one of the moon’s ossified lava fields covered the opposite page. She used her thumbnail to carve a gash across the cat’s face. When she was a teenager she should have forced herself to talk to more people and become more confident. Then she and Brendan wouldn’t argue about whether or not she was doing enough to overcome her shyness, and she might not have to worry that Brendan stayed with her to remain close to her father and that he wished she was as exotic and self-assured as Lae.</p>
<p>The back door of Maya’s house creaked open. Maya closed the magazine as Brendan stepped outside.</p>
<p>Brendan, like Lae, had spent six months working for Maya’s father when he was in art school. After her father moved to Laos, Brendan had taken over his taxidermy shop in Oregon and moved in with Maya. He longed to create a mount as beautiful and moving as her father’s masterpieces and had spent most of the last five months in the basement painting a coelacanth—a fish believed to have gone extinct 65 million years ago until one was discovered living off the coast of Madagascar in 1938. He wanted to enter the coelacanth in the next World Taxidermy Championship to impress her father and the biologists who’d shipped him so many rare specimens. But Maya was sure Brendan also hoped the mount would impress Lae.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, Maya had discovered an oil painting in Brendan’s shop. It showed Lae standing barefoot on the bank of the Mekong River and smelling a flower on a blooming bush. The flower’s petals were lava-red and fogged with yellow, and their ruffled edges were curled back to reveal the flower’s soft, almost glowing sea-green throat. The flower’s three silver-pink sepals, just inches from Lae’s lips, seemed to blush. Lae wore a white, knee-length skirt and a red tank top. Flower petals littered the riverbank. Brendan must have used a photograph of Lae to paint the details of her face.</p>
<p>Brendan walked over to Maya and kissed her forehead. “Happy birthday,” he said. He wore sandals, faded jeans ripped at his knees, and a vermillion t-shirt with the words “Brendan Dowling’s Taxidermy” in calligraphic letters above a charcoal drawing of a walleye wearing a beret and holding a palette and paintbrush in its pectoral fins. His long brown hair was in a ponytail, and his gray eyes shone like frosted glass in the sunlight. He smelled, as usual, like acrylic paint. “Hey, that’s a St. Lawrence River skiff,” Brendan said.</p>
<p>“Your father’s boat!” Maya said. She wished the boat was closer so she could study its ribs, decks, floorboards, coamings, and oarlocks. Learning new details about Brendan’s life still exhilarated her. A month after they’d begun dating, when Brendan still seemed to find her quietness mysterious, she’d bought a Macanudo Diplomat cigar—the kind Brendan’s father, an endocrinologist in New York City, had smoked during his boating trips with Brendan down the Oswegatchie River through the evergreen forests of the Adirondack foothills. Then she’d pushed her father’s rowboat onto the Rock, rowed to a grove of spruce trees, lit the cigar, and set it on the empty seat. She closed her eyes, smelled the cigar smoke and the spruce needles and the river water and the rowboat’s cedar floorboards, and tried to inhabit one of Brendan’s most vivid childhood memories, to feel it shaping his love of rivers.</p>
<p>“Did you catch who was rowing it?” Brendan asked.</p>
<p>“A couple teenagers, I think.” Maya rolled the magazine into a tube. “I wasn’t really paying attention.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you look up and say hello to them?”</p>
<p>“You were watching me?” Maya’s face burned.</p>
<p>“I was washing some brushes and just happened to look out the window,” Brendan said. “It’s great you did something that makes you uncomfortable.” He blew on the face of his wristwatch and scrubbed it with his thumb. “At least turning thirty lights a fire under you. If not to start talking with boaters, then to paint a coelacanth. Hell, your father was drinking Romanée Conti with Salvador Dalí when he was my age. Speaking of your father, that crate must be from him, huh? Ready to open it?”</p>
<p>“Maybe not quite as ready as you seem to be,” Maya said.</p>
<p>“We probably shouldn’t wait too long,” Brendan said. “Anything could be in there.”</p>
<p>Maya pulled at the frayed edges of one of the vinyl strips webbing her lawn chair.  “Even something Lae might have looked at and maybe even touched, I suppose.” She used the sweat on her palm to smooth the unruly strings.</p>
<p>Brendan blew on his watch again and polished the glass with the hem of his shirt. “Maya, like I told you, you don’t even know when I made that painting. Or how impulsive I was feeling. But do I miss Lae? Yes.” He stared toward the Rock. Sudsy water churned beside the bank, and the cement statue of Chief Black Hawk towered atop a bluff several miles downriver. “The river hasn’t even looked the same since she and your father left.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t know she meant more to you than the river.”</p>
<p>“That’s hardly what I’m saying,” Brendan said.</p>
<p>Maya dropped the magazine on the grass and stood. “I guess now is as good a time as any to open it.”</p>
<p>They walked around the house to the front porch. A refrigerator and some words in Lao were stenciled in a corner of the crate’s lid. Brendan took a tack hammer from his back pocket. He knelt beside the crate, pried up the lid, and dragged it off.</p>
<p>Inside, surrounded by foam strips, was a small whale. The varnish coating its body glistened like wet mucus. Would it suddenly begin to thrash? Maya swatted some of the foam onto her porch. It wasn’t a whale but the biggest, fleshiest catfish she’d ever seen. Thousands of gold, silver, brown, and gray streaks covered the fish’s back. Metallic pink, yellow, and red smears sparkled like hummingbird feathers near the base of its erect, iridescent silver dorsal fin. The fish’s head sloped like the hood of a car toward its long, fleshy lips. A narrow flap of skin concealed a zipper running from its dorsal fin down its lower back.</p>
<p>“This would win the taxidermy championship hands-down,” Brendan said.</p>
<p>Maya removed some paper stuck between the fish’s beet-red gill rakers. “‘Dear Maya,’” she read aloud. “‘Happy thirtieth birthday. Several weeks ago, Lae found this five hundred pound, seven-foot-long pa beuk, or Mekong giant catfish, on the bank of the Mekong River. As you probably know, these catfish are critically endangered and rarely reach this size anymore. Some Lao believe Mekong catfish spawn in underwater caves of gold and consider them sacred. For several days Lae and I cooked and ate its delicious meat while I preserved and painted its skin. Nights I painted by torchlight on the balcony as douc langurs barked in the rosewood trees. The mount’s more unique features honor Boun Makha Bouxa, when some Lao dress up as fish and set captured birds and fish free to transmit gratitude to the earth’s energies. This is the first fish I’ve mounted in over a year, and I don’t plan to ever mount another fish again. Maya, I know what an imperfect father I’ve been. However, I would be honored if you would allow me to entrust this piece to you. With love, Dad.’”</p>
<p>Maya moved her fingertips over her father’s words, his needle-straight lines and loops the shapes of dragonfly wings. “Why did he go through so much trouble mounting this and sending it to me?” Certain words—“gold,” “torchlight,” “gratitude,” “imperfect,” “love”—were pressed deeper into the paper. “Maybe he really does feel guilty about ignoring me for his art,” she said. “And then giving it up like it was nothing to move to the jungle with a woman young enough to be his daughter.”</p>
<p>“I felt betrayed, too,” Brendan said. “But just because he moved off with Lae doesn’t mean he prefers her to you or me.”</p>
<p>“Maybe you’re right. How could you develop a true preference for someone in <em>six months</em>?” Maya refolded the paper and placed it back in the fish’s gills as her father had done so many thousands of miles away. Especially, she thought, someone like <em>her</em>? Once, when Lae was alone in the studio, Maya had asked her if she liked studying at the Art Institute. Lae had just nodded—as if Maya’s question was inane or Maya made her uncomfortable—and resumed painting a neon orange bass with electric blue eyes and a fluorescent fuchsia stripe along its side. Maya had hurried out of the studio. A few months later, Lae rescued an eagle chick that had fallen from its nest during a storm. When she invited Maya into the studio to see it, Maya had reclaimed some of her pride by telling her she was too busy to stop in.</p>
<p>“I’m going to find a flashlight so we can see inside it.” Brendan stood and walked toward the house.</p>
<p>Maya picked up a foam strip and snapped it in half. “Look at you vandalizing that poor bass,” she imagined telling Lae, “with all that gaudy paint! Performing those dances in that silk dress on the Lao New Year wasn’t enough to make you seem exotic? Really, isn’t it enough being such a savior? Look at you rescuing eagles—no, eagle <em>chicks</em>—and nobly granting unsophisticated dullards—mere li<em>brar</em>ians—the opportunity to see them! The opportunity of a lifetime! Ha! Ha! Ha! You really need to stop distracting my father from his important work. And something tells me you’re planning to give a photo of yourself to my—” Maya realized she was speaking out loud. Could Brendan have heard her? She glanced at the house. Luckily the front windows were shut. She took a deep breath. How many times each day did she nearly tremble with anger and imagine speaking like this to Lae? Was that normal?</p>
<p>Brendan returned with a flashlight and they unzipped the fish. Its dark, deep interior resembled a small cave. Maya’s father hadn’t removed the catfish’s skull. Its skin was lined with a hard, thick layer of hide paste. The fish’s throat contained tiny, mesh-covered air holes and eyeholes. Someone’s calves could fit through openings near its enormous tail fin; one’s arms, through holes concealed by its pelvic fins. The mount smelled of acrylic paint, varnish, fish epidermal mucus, clams, seaweed, and a rich, earthy odor that must’ve been the smell of the Mekong River. Was that what her father smelled when he stepped outside? Was Brendan smelling it too and imagining he was tasting the same air Lae breathed?</p>
<p>Brendan rubbed his chin and stared at the fish. Maya imagined him picturing Lae walking barefoot along the riverbank, kneeling beside the gigantic beached catfish, waving flies away from its body. “What are you thinking about?” she asked.</p>
<p>Brendan opened and closed the clasp on his watchband. “I probably shouldn’t bring this up today, but …”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you tell me after we bring it in?” Maya’s heart slammed against her chest. Was Brendan going to break up with her? They each lifted an end of the catfish, which weighed about a hundred pounds, eased it through the front door, and rested it on its thick pelvic fins on the dining room table. The catfish’s head and tail fin both stretched several feet beyond the table. Its dorsal fin nearly scratched the ceiling. The fish’s belly, swirled with grays and whites, resembled marble. Patches of its silver-purple sides shone like pearl.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Maya pulled a chair away from the table and sat down.</p>
<p>“As I’ve been painting the coelacanth, I keep wondering about something. This mount … reminded me of it too.” Brendan sat down beside Maya. “One morning, a couple months before your father moved to Laos, I got to his studio early. They were …” He picked a flake of foam off the catfish’s gill filaments and stared at it. “They were having sex against his desk. As I backed away, Lae stumbled and fell against the bluefin. But your father kept having sex with her. He didn’t even hesitate or seem to care at all that they might damage the bluefin.”</p>
<p>“That’s what it is?” Maya leaned back against her chair. “Why did you tell me that? The most time my dad and I spent together was around that fish.”</p>
<p>“I’d just never even seen your dad act at all casually around any of his masterpieces,” Brendan said. “There’s something almost spiritual about taking a corpse and transforming it into art. What had he realized that made him risk damaging the bluefin?” He stood. “Let me grab something from the basement to help me explain.”</p>
<p>Maya walked into the bathroom and stepped in front of the mirror. She wiped away a tear and stared at her dark green eyes and wavy brown hair and at the wrinkles forming around her eyes and mouth. Could she ever look or seem as exotic as Lae? Maya’s most unordinary feature was her name, which her father had chosen because he loved Mayan art. Her father certainly would’ve picked a different name if he could have known how much it would clash with her personality.</p>
<p>Maya stepped into the living room. Brendan had come back upstairs. He held an envelope.</p>
<p>Brendan sat on the edge of a couch cushion. “I want so badly to preserve one of the last members of a species,” he said. “To create one mount that’s as beautiful and powerful and important as any of your father’s. It took me five months just to paint that coelacanth’s head.” Brendan opened and closed the envelope’s flap. “Am I even talented enough to do that? Is it even worth it?” He removed a sheet of paper from the envelope. “Let me read you this letter your father sent me last week. I think it’s a clue—just like his note to you and the Mekong catfish—about why he risked damaging the bluefin and why he really moved to Laos.”</p>
<p>Maya rested her head against the bathroom doorframe. She ran her fingertip over a groove in the door.</p>
<p>Brendan took a deep breath. “‘As you paint that coelacanth,’” he read, “‘that celebrity fish, at the beginning of your mounting career, I want to confide in you my rather personal experiences with the much lesser known Ash Meadows poolfish. Three decades—’”</p>
<p>“It’s nice my dad feels comfortable telling you his intimate thoughts about that fish.” Maya blew some dust off her fingertip. “He never mentioned it to me.”</p>
<p>“Forget it.” Brendan tucked the letter into the envelope. “I’ll finish reading it later.” He opened a desk drawer, took out a small wrapped box, and handed it to Maya. “I might as well give you this now,” he said. “Happy birthday.”</p>
<p>Maya took the box, held it for a moment, and then slowly unwrapped and opened it. Inside lay an intricate carving of two herons rising into flight. “It’s beautiful,” Maya said. The carving gleamed in the sunlight. “How long did this take you?”</p>
<p>“To get that sheen I used maple wood and polished it with walnut oil.”</p>
<p>Maybe the two herons symbolized her and Brendan. Maya set the carving on a shelf above the couch. Was she misinterpreting the painting Brendan had made? “I’m sorry I’m being so difficult today,” Maya said. She kissed Brendan’s lips and leaned against his chest. “I’m not turning thirty very gracefully.”</p>
<p>“Who does?” Brendan squeezed Maya’s shoulders. “I’m going to finish painting the coelacanth’s left pectoral fin.” He walked toward the basement door. “Later you’re going to hear the rest of that letter.”</p>
<p>Maya walked around the mount. The Mekong catfish’s back was almost as wide and flat as the dining room table. She ducked under the fish’s tail fin. There was more room for the mount in their bedroom. The fish’s eyes, sunk several inches into its fleshy cheeks, were flecked with hundreds of shades of blue and seemed to stare back at her. This giant fish beside their bed might keep her awake or give her nightmares. Brendan might find it awkward to have sex with her near it. Maya stopped walking. Perhaps Brendan would like to make love next to the mount. Maybe it would excite him, and help him feel closer to understanding her father, if they risked damaging the mount by making love against it. Or even right on top of it, since its back was so flat. Would Brendan find her more exotic if he saw her leaning or lying against the fish? Could lying across such a beautiful, priceless piece of art change how she viewed herself?</p>
<p>Maya squeezed between the fish’s head and the wall. Pastel blue and pink blotches covered the skin around its lips. She should have laughed off this idea already. Could she even make love near the fish? She pulled her father’s note from the fish’s gills and opened her china cabinet. On the bottom shelf, against the wooden trunk containing all the letters her father had sent her, leaned a framed strip of the lemon-yellow kite he’d tied to his line when he fished for bluefin. He’d given it to Maya one afternoon after he’d painted the bluefin’s chest and described how the kite danced and swooped across the sky when he got a bite or fought a big fish. Maya tossed the note on the trunk and shut the cabinet door. Why hadn’t her father stopped when Lae fell against the bluefin? Why had he given up mounting so abruptly?</p>
<p>Maya spent the next few hours reading by the river and picking scallions and chili peppers from her garden. She brought the vegetables into the kitchen as Brendan came upstairs. Maya cut up chicken, crushed garlic, diced the scallions, and sliced the seeds and ribs from the peppers. Brendan turned on the second suite of Franz Liszt’s <em>Années de Pèlerinage</em>, stirred chicken broth into a bowl of masa harina, and blended the garlic, scallions, and peppers. As they lined corn husks with masa harina and folded them over clusters of chicken and chili sauce to form tamales, they talked about everyday things: rock tumblers, cicada shells, the taste of liquid amoxicillin, Bob Dylan’s sunglasses. It was the longest Maya had talked to Brendan—and the first meal they’d cooked together—since he’d begun painting the coelacanth. The pleasantness of it was undercut by Maya’s awareness that if it wasn’t her birthday Brendan would still be in the basement painting.</p>
<p>Brendan lit two candles near the edges of the table. The flames swayed just inches from the catfish.</p>
<p>“Want to put the mount somewhere else?” Maya asked.</p>
<p>Brendan set their plates on the table. “Doesn’t it make the perfect centerpiece?”</p>
<p>“You’re right,” Maya said. “We’ll feel like we’re dining in a museum.”</p>
<p>Brendan poured them each a glass of Riesling. They sat down beside each other.</p>
<p>Maya took a sip of wine and traced a red flowerpot on her napkin. She pictured the red tank top Lae wore in Brendan’s painting. Had Brendan seen her in that tank top on a certain day? As he’d painted the tops of Lae’s breasts, had he imagined how they’d feel pressed against his chest? In front of her, the catfish—which she could lie across just as Lae had leaned against the bluefin—shimmered like a giant opal. Its soft yellow tail fin glowed in the candlelight like a crescent moon. “Maybe we’re like that fish,” Maya said. “We’ve been going out for almost a year and a half. But hasn’t our relationship become hollow and endangered? Is it even still alive? Or have we just become good at making it appear that way?” Her heartbeat quickened. “Remember when we’d hike to the statue of Black Hawk to eat lunch and look out over the river? Or those times we made love in the woods? When we talked about moving closer to Chicago so I could work at a university library and we could eat at interesting restaurants? Now you’re always at your shop or in the basement.” Maya felt dizzy. Had she really just said all that?</p>
<p>“Just wait until I finish the coelacanth,” Brendan said quickly. “As soon as I’m getting work from museums, I’ll sell the shop.” He dragged his wine glass closer to his plate. “I can’t believe they ate its meat.”</p>
<p>“Has that been bothering you?” Maya put her fork down. Brendan must have seen the article in the March issue of <em>National Geographic</em> about how some Lao believed Mekong catfish meat strengthened their sexual abilities. Maya lifted her glass too quickly and spilled wine on her jeans. She stood. “I’ll be right back.”</p>
<p>Maya went into the bedroom, opened the closet door, and pushed aside the khakis and knee-length beige skirts she wore to the library. She hesitated and then grabbed a skirt someone had wrapped in a Home Depot bag and placed in the library’s book drop last month. Maya changed into the skirt—which hit her mid-thigh and was streaked with fluorescent orange and pink—and stepped in front of the mirror.</p>
<p>Was she as striking as Lae? Maya imagined leaving Brendan, working at the University of Chicago library, dressing more enticingly, and telling her coworkers about the researchers and doctoral students who took her out to dinner and who longed to make love to her on the Mekong catfish. After all, year after year it had swum down the Mekong River from Vietnam to the flooded forests around Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia, beneath fishermen in pirogues and past gleaming pagodas and old French colonial villas with bougainvilleas spilling down their walls, to spawn, perhaps in an underwater golden cave, beneath Khone Falls in southern Laos. And if Mekong catfish ever became extinct, the mount might be all that kept them from vanishing completely. After Brendan had forgotten about Lae and tortured himself by imagining all the dates Maya had gone on, Maya would invite him into her condo. She imagined leaning back against the fish, and staring out her window at the moonlit spires atop an old cathedral, as Brendan stepped toward her from the doorway.</p>
<p>Maya turned once more in front of the mirror and walked back into the dining room.</p>
<p>“Wow,” Brendan said. “You look amazing.” He put his arm around her waist.</p>
<p>“I came across this last month and forgot all about it.” Maya moved away from Brendan. “Help me carry the mount into the living room,” she said. “I want to wipe off the table and sit by the river.”</p>
<p>They set the Mekong catfish on the living room carpet, carried lawn chairs to the river, and fished and drank wine until it grew dark.</p>
<p>Brendan took the envelope containing Maya’s father’s letter from his pocket. “Ready to hear the rest?” he asked.</p>
<p>“As ready as I’ll ever be,” Maya said.</p>
<p>Brendan unfolded the letter and cleared his throat. “‘Three decades ago,’” he read, “‘the very last Ash Meadows poolfish, a creature no longer than my index finger, was shipped to me by an ichthyologist who lived alone in the Mojave Desert in an ancient Chemehuevi Indian turquoise mine. He burned the spines off cactus fruit, cooked iguana meat over mesquite wood, and studied the native poolfish and pupfish in the small, sun-shrunk springs which had seeped through faults in the valleys of Ash Meadows. When the only poolfish he found in one spring was floating on its side in the shade of a creosote bush, he decided to census the fish in each spring. But to his horror, he found only pupfish along with mollies, mosquitofish, and other invasive species which had outcompeted the poolfish. Just like that, it was gone.</p>
<p>“‘When I was your age, I adorned the last Ash Meadows poolfish’s tiny silver and blue scales with the black mottling they would have developed during this fish’s short spawning season. The orange circlets around its eyes I captured with shavings from a bright vermillion desert rock. Finally, with diluted fluorescent oranges and yellows, I depicted the simmering beauty of its fins, like translucent flames.</p>
<p>“‘For twenty five years the last Ash Meadows poolfish remained in a dark, forgotten corner of the underground wing of the Nevada Museum of Natural History. Then, five years ago, vandals broke in and stole it along with some other vulnerable artifacts. It resurfaced a year and a half ago at a garage sale in Tonopah, Nevada. Its scales had been painted with maroon nail polish and Wite-Out, its gill covers trimmed with a nail clipper, its eyes drilled out, its fins burnt black. I could have restored the fish. But did humanity deserve a second chance to appreciate it? One night, regardless of whether or not I had a right to use my power to decide, I squeezed the last poolfish of Ash Meadows into the neck of an empty bottle of Glenfiddich Vintage Reserve 1977, walked to the end of a long aluminum fishing dock, and threw it into the middle of the Rock River. Two weeks earlier, you might be surprised to learn, I’d met you and Lae.’”</p>
<p>Maya stared at the bottle of Chehalem Dry Riesling beside her lawn chair. “You’re right,” she said. “That letter does help explain some things, doesn’t it?” She lifted her glass. In the waning sunlight, the reflection of the wine flickered and sparkled on her skirt. “What would that ichthyologist have thought?”</p>
<p>Brendan picked at the envelope’s seams with his fingernail. “That ichthyologist might have had bigger problems,” he said.</p>
<p>“Maybe he was brilliant and had a hard time socializing with people,” Maya said. “It could be lonelier to live around a bunch of people you can’t be yourself around than in a cave in the desert.”</p>
<p>Brendan put his hand on Maya’s knee. Heron fledglings squawked and screeched in their nests crowning some dead birch trees along the estuary. The breeze was pregnant with the springy smells of purple loosestrife and blazing star blooming along the river. The lights around the base of Chief Black Hawk flickered on. The luminous cement figure stared from the bluff across the dark river.</p>
<p>“Maybe one reason Lorado Taft made that statue so massive,” Brendan said, “was so nobody could ever shove it into a bottle of Glenfiddich and throw it in the river.”</p>
<p>They took their wine glasses into the living room and sat on the couch. The candles still burned on the dining room table. Wax had dripped and dried into white stalactites along their sides. The swaying, flexing flames shone on the catfish’s varnished skin like two fiery gold fish swimming in place.</p>
<p>“It’s hauntingly alive, isn’t it?” Brendan said. “Like if we slid it into the river it would swim off.”</p>
<p>“I can see why some Lao view these fish as sacred,” Maya said, “and even why my father saw this fish as a monument to life. Can you imagine how many eggs it laid or fertilized during its life?”</p>
<p>A gleaming glob of wax rolled down one of the candlesticks. Its reflection inched across the catfish’s back and glinted on its zipper.</p>
<p>Maya took a long sip of wine. She set down her glass, slid off the couch, and knelt beside the fish. “Is that a second zipper?” she asked.</p>
<p>Brendan knelt beside her. “Where?”</p>
<p>Maya leaned closer to the fish. “Oh no—it’s not.” She stretched out her legs, leaned back, and let her hair fall across the catfish’s gills. Shadows and candlelight exchanged places across the ceiling and walls. “Can you believe this fish was alive a few weeks ago?” Maya asked. “Swimming in the Mekong River through Laos? Eating clams? Maybe even making love to other catfish in underwater caves of gold? And here it is, in this room, right in front of us.”</p>
<p>Brendan kissed Maya. As he moved his hand over her thigh she leaned back against the mount. Brendan helped her ease herself across the catfish’s back. The hide paste under its skin supported her weight. Brendan lifted Maya’s shirt over her shoulders. The catfish’s skin felt cool against her back. Maya almost laughed as she pictured Lae kneeling beside the fish and yelling for her father.</p>
<p>As Brendan undressed, Maya wedged her shirt between her hip and the catfish’s dorsal fin. Brendan kept one foot on the ground and propped his other on the fish’s pelvic fin. Somewhere beneath Maya a fin cracked and hide paste shattered. Maya dug her fingers into the fish’s gills and clasped a gill arch as Brendan whispered her name and moved over her.</p>
<p>The catfish gave up the smells of clams and seaweeds and foamy waterfalls, of bougainvilleas and jacarandas whose petals had landed in the river, of water spiced with the pinecones and sap of Chinese swamp cypresses. It released the murmurs of fishermen in the cabins of boats at night, the thump of distant music and the whispers of waves reflecting the neon lights of Vientiane, the groans of soaring hairy-leafed apitong trees bending in the breeze, and the clap of its body against the body of another catfish deep inside an underwater cave. Maya smelled and listened to the catfish, and she wrapped her arms around Brendan’s neck as he moved his hands over her and as the candlelight danced back and forth across the catfish’s pearly, shining skin and her own naked body.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>1859</p>
<p>Lucy never came to Amesbury without checking its position on the mantle, secretly fearing that her poor offering would be relegated to a less conspicuous spot.  But there it was, still standing in a pure column of color, the blue vase she had given Mr. Whittier five years previous, when she won Amos Lawrence’s prize for her poem “Call to Kansas.” Set to the tune of “Nelly Bly,” the song became a popular rallying cry for pioneers settling Kansas for the Free Soil cause.  Though “Call” was far more polemical than the gentle pastoral verses Lucy published, with increasing regularity, in religious papers and ladies’ magazines, the $50 prize was the largest amount of money she had ever earned from her poetry, and the reprints in nearly every paper in the country represented a fame beyond her most extravagant dreams.</p>
<p>She considered it only right, then that she should pay tribute to her friend Whittier with some personal token in celebration of the victory.  After all, without his constant encouragement she would not have been able to continue writing at all.  She thought, with some pride, of her labor in the factory at Lowell, and her progression from doffer to rover without ever losing the rhythm of her vocation.  She recalled her travails in Looking Glass Prairie, the cramped cabin where she kept house for her sister’s family and the bare floor of the schoolhouse where she attempted to maintain order and syntax amid her rough rural pupils.  She remembered the heavy housework she had done in exchange for her education at Monticello Seminary and her current uncomfortable teaching position at Wheaton Academy, where she was forced to barter for each precious pearl of solitude and beg for the privilege to miss Sunday services to take a walk in the woods behind the school or catch the train to Boston.  Through all these circumstances, Whittier had written to her, encouraged her, recommended her work to various editors, and thoroughly revised every scrap of verse she had ever had the temerity to send him.  Even now, when she closed her eyes, she saw the dark marks of his corrections on a page of her overgrown lines.</p>
<p>The vase, doubled in the mirror over the mantle, drew her attention again and she stared with displeasure at the overblown roses that drooped over its rim.  Not only were they the wrong color, a garish pink, they were several days past their prime, with brown spots like the bruises in a spoiled apple. Who had placed them there only to be neglected? Perhaps it was Elizabeth, Whittier’s sister, who suffered from frequent debilitating headaches, and so might stay in her bed for several days on end, leaving the poet’s study in disarray.  At any rate, Lucy hoped it was Elizabeth and not some other, unknown presence.</p>
<p>Lucy removed the damp flowers, setting them in a folded page of newspaper that she retrieved from her handbag.  Then she lifted the vase from the mantle and examined it in the light. This small item, purchased from the Boston &amp; Sandwich Glass Company, had cost her five dollars, a full tithe of her prize.  Fashioned from glass as dark as ink, it had a rough seam running down one side and a raised design of diamonds over most of its surface. Looking closely, she could see that the glass itself was riddled with tiny swirls and air bubbles like the current of the Merrimack.   “Lacy glass,” they called it, and when she presented the gift to Whittier her poetic imagination substituted a “u” for the “a” so that she claimed to be granting him a present of Lucy Glass, through which the world would assume the happy appearance of a mountain landscape.</p>
<p>The gift was not merely a whim; it had a practical purpose as well.  Whittier’s color blindness prevented him from distinguishing between red and green, and, as a result, he missed much of nature’s beauty: the tongues of hibiscus in the summer, the firs profiled against the setting sun in winter, and the blazing maple leaves in the fall.  His palate was composed almost entirely of yellow and blue, and so Lucy, determined to give him the greatest pleasure from his limited range of perception, chose the blue vase, telling him to keep it filled with yellow flowers, their bright blooms standing out with conviction against the indigo glass.</p>
<p>Lucy loved to tease her friend about the irony of colorblindness in a man called “Greenleaf,” unable to make out the color of his coat, and so prevented from recognizing his own goodness.  In spite of his fame as a poet and his dignity as a Quaker, Whittier seemed to enjoy these jests, encouraging her humor at his expense.  Lucy was not insensitive to the honor. And yet, recently, when he invited her to address him by this family name, she could not bring herself to breach the last bit of distance between master and pupil.</p>
<p>She refilled the vase with water from a pitcher on the table and deposited the goldenrods she had brought as a house gift, trying not to brush the blooms with her fingers as she arranged the stalks into a graceful fan.  Nevertheless a dusting of pollen appeared on her gloves and her hand ran irresistibly to her throat, where she wore a black velvet ribbon to hide her disfigurement. Underneath, her neck was a welter of old raised scars and fresh red sores damp with discharge. The outbreak was now in full bloom, in spite of her careful diet and walking regime.</p>
<p>The term always took its toll and as she filled her grade book with marks and her notebooks with commentary on Aristotle and Wordsworth, she developed the usual symptoms of overwork: headaches, insomnia, and the reappearance of the scrofula that she first suffered as a girl in the mills at Lowell.  And something more came with the physical symptoms, a shrinking from all contact, as if she were unfit, with her tainted flesh, to share the company of her clean, privileged, and pampered pupils, who had no doubt never known a day of physical labor.  Some said the scrofula was caused by contagion, while others believed it was passed along from mother to child in the blood.  In either case, Lucy felt a scourge beyond the physical symptoms and considered the disease a mark of Cain barring her from all decent society.</p>
<p>But the Whittiers, with their quiet habits and gentle humor, always restored her to the human family.  She planned to stay at Amesbury for a full week, followed by a few days in Boston, where she would meet her old friend Harriet Robinson for a tour of the museums and keep a surreptitious appointment with a faith healer who claimed he could cure the scrofula with help from his contacts in the spirit world.  Of the three remedies, she wondered which would be the most effective.</p>
<p>She doubted it would be the meeting with Harriet. In the spring, Hattie’s four-year-old son had died of a fever, and Lucy, offering what poor comfort she could, wrote urging her friend to accept God’s mysterious will.  Harriet’s answer came back a blast of fury from the cold heart of grief.  If Lucy ever had the courage to bear a child herself, she would understand that God’s will was no match for a mother’s love.  Lucy could not think how to respond, she had not meant to give offense, but only, remembering the deaths of her many nieces and nephews, sought the gentlest and most conventional expression of sympathy.  Now, far from comforting her friend, she had given her an additional cause of suffering.</p>
<p>Well, she would have to isolate herself from even her friends if she wanted to protect them.  Whittier himself occasionally suffered from the vagaries of her moods, especially when she couldn’t suppress her resentment at his neglect.  What had it been—two months, three, since he sent her a proper letter and not merely a note making arrangements or revising her work?  Longing to see some scrap of his script, she moved to his desk to see what he was writing.  His work had shifted, in recent months, from abolitionist ballads to idylls of an earlier New England.  Now that the nation was finally roused to a fury over slavery, Liberty’s laureate felt relieved of a burden and freed to return to more intimate themes. She saw that this manuscript was a new poem about a town stilled by a snowfall.  The silence of nature seemed to descend upon the lines and weigh them down, like boughs heavy with snow.  It was a fine poem, full of quiet joy, and she felt her breath slowing to its rhythm.  In contrast to the ballads, ringing with the energy of outraged virtue, this one had a calming effect, slowing the blood in her veins and producing a distinctly sensual form of relaxation.</p>
<p>Did she dare turn over the page?  To read what was left out in the open was perhaps acceptable, but to touch and rearrange his papers would be to intrude. In spite of her moral scruples, she lifted the page and continued on to the next stanza.  In fact, she became so absorbed she did not hear the poet enter the room.</p>
<p>“Dost thou have any corrections, my friend?” His voice, deep and rich as the echo in a mountain pass, startled her with its intimacy.  “Thou must tell me.  For I know that thou would not otherwise disturb the privacy of my desk.”</p>
<p>She blushed, falling, as she generally did, into Quaker speech as she addressed him.  “I am very sorry to transgress thy privacy.  I fear I was Mesmerized by the beauty of thy poem.”</p>
<p>“I have gone past the summit of my days,” he said.  “And now I find my thoughts returning to my boyhood.”   Could it be that her friend was growing old?  He still had the same vigorous expression and restless intellect and yet he was no longer the spry walker he had been, preferring to stay behind, on treks in the White Mountains, to keep camp and tend the fire.  Looking at his face, she saw the white in his beard and the lines in his forehead. It was no wonder that he wanted to write about snow instead of blossoms.  If Whittier was no longer a man of middle age, Lucy herself was no longer a girl.  She had grown heavy in the service of her muse, and as she gained greater confidence in her verse, her body itself became coarse and clumsy.  She was now thirty-five years of age. How long could she remain a pupil?</p>
<p>“And what of thy work, dear Lucy?  Hast thou made any progress on the story?”<br />
This was an old subject of conversation. After Lucy’s poem appeared to such fanfare, Whittier placed an announcement in The National Era, advertising a Western story to be published by Miss Lucy Larcom of “Call to Kansas” fame.  He wanted her to write a popular novel, one like The Lamplighter, which would bring more profit than her poetry and attract the attention she deserved.  Lucy was flattered by the proposition, but when he went so far as to announce the project in public as an accomplished fact, he placed her in a false position. Reading over the advertisement, she experienced a rare surge of anger, which she could never express to him, but remembered confiding to Harriet during a visit to the Athenaeum, as they stood in front of a stirring oil painting of a blue and orange storm at sea.  Now her head pulsed with annoyance and her throat stung under the velvet band.</p>
<p>“I have written a few more pages, but I fear the pace of the term has overtaken me.”</p>
<p>“My poor friend.  I am sorry to hear it.”</p>
<p>Lucy would as soon throw those pages in the fire as give them up for his perusal.  A woman without a story, whose life proceeded in strange starts and stops, interrupted, here and there, by the flowering of a short-lived joy or the passing of a flickering sorrow, she did not have the experience to produce a fully formed narrative.  She did, however, carry with her a small sheaf of poems she had written in the weeks since her last visit to Amesbury, and so she pulled them out of her satchel, as if to pacify him.  She felt, more and more, a yearning toward independence, a desire as strong as the need for sunlight or exercise. And yet, in her poverty, she believed that this ritual of correction was the only thing she had to offer the man who had become the dearest person in her life.  So, once again, she handed over her poor efforts for his inspection.</p>
<p>It was as if she had given him a rare treasure.  His worn face assumed a childlike greed as he weighed the stack of papers in his hand, rubbing the top sheet with satisfaction.  Then he lifted his pen from the inkstand and began to make corrections, dark and arbitrary as musical notations, even before he had finished the first stanza.  Reading the revised verse aloud, he marked out the time on his knee, stopping frequently to taste the flavor of a word on his tongue or substitute one rhyme for another.   Lucy sat stunned at his ability to manufacture verse on demand, as mechanically as a weaver producing cloth on a power loom.  In this small private room, the strength of his genius was on full display, and, sitting in its presence, she felt everything at once: shame and desire, pride and humility, anger and love.</p>
<p>Her words in his mouth represented the greatest intimacy to which she could ever aspire, and yet also the basest humiliation she would ever wish to experience, as he tore open the lines she had so carefully braided together and rewove them with a practiced craftsman’s skill.   She began to grow hot in the close room, and moved nearer to Whittier, away from the fire.  She could hardly bear the pressure of the ribbon on her neck, or the irritation of the open lesions.  He had reached “The Pestilence,” a poem she had written only few weeks ago, when the pressure of her disease forced her indoors and made the slightest human contact an unbearable act of violation.</p>
<p>Earth has been wrapped within a tainted zone,<br />
A girdle poisoned with unwholesome dews.<br />
But she was sick; this did her Guardian choose<br />
To make his will for her quick healing known.</p>
<p>Hearing him read the lines, Lucy grew even warmer, feeling the dampness under her arms and behind her knees, and in fact in every place where her body had the misfortune to touch itself.  She longed for the purity of a corporeal being whose parts were never forced to meet in such cramped circumstances.</p>
<p>“’Unwholesome dews.’  Thou referest, I suppose, to the results of fever.”</p>
<p>“That is my intention,” she said, thinking also of the discharge from her wounds and of the flow from between her legs, grown darker over time.  She was herself frequently covered with dews of an unwholesome nature.</p>
<p>“Shouldst thou not say rather the sickly brine?”</p>
<p>“That would mar the rhyme, wouldn’t it?”</p>
<p>“From dews and choose thou might progress to ‘brine’ and ‘divine.’  Canst thou not hear the improvement?”</p>
<p>Lucy, flushed and tired as she was, tried to consider the case rationally.  No, “dews” was exactly what she meant, the moistness that came upon a body in the night, without consciousness or exertion, dampening all plans for improvement.</p>
<p>Whittier continued without waiting for Lucy’s reply, and she felt a prickle behind her ear as she heard her words altered to reflect his glory.  Staring at him, she saw the comic aspect of his posture he marked and tapped, tapped and read, his leg jiggling as if he were riding a fast horse.  He was a man of genius, yes, but she must be a fool to trust him with her whole being.</p>
<p>Just before he reached the final line, there was a disturbance at the door.  Lucy felt it as a wave more than a noise, the rising up of another presence in the room.  She tried to suppress her annoyance, because she assumed it was Elizabeth, who had been a better friend to her than Whittier himself, keeping up their correspondence when her brother could or would not.</p>
<p>But as she turned to greet the poet’s sister, she saw that it was another woman entirely who entered the room with curt step and a spirit of ownership.  Perhaps half a minute passed before Lucy was able to recognize the sharp unpleasant features, the large nose and excellent figure, the stylish green dress with its reptilian sheen, as the defining features of Gail Hamilton, an aspiring writer from the neighborhood.  Gail had, on several occasions, accompanied the Whittiers’ group to the White Mountains, where she insisted on entertaining the poet with passages from her brittle, witty letters to friends abroad.  Lucy was surprised that her friend took an interest in such worldly compositions, not to mention a woman of such frivolous charms.</p>
<p>She had never known Miss Hamilton to visit Amesbury before.  The woman was, as far as Lucy knew, still living in Washington and working as a governess for the publisher of The National Era.  What could she be doing here in Whittier’s study?  Perhaps she had been granted leave from her position to relay a message or undertake some secretarial task.  She certainly gave every appearance of playing an official role.<br />
As Lucy watched, immobilized, Gail moved to the mantle and picked up the vase, tipping it toward her and touching the goldenrods with her light-colored gloves.  Miss Hamilton, the daughter of a wealthy merchant, would surely scorn the common goldenrod, not to mention the humble vessel.</p>
<p>“Our roses have faded, I see, and are now replaced with the flowers of the field.”<br />
Whittier bristled, as if caught in an act of infidelity.  “Miss Larcom has arrived and brought the outdoors with her. Thou knowest Miss Hamilton, of course.”<br />
Lucy nodded, making an effort to control the muscles of her face.  “We were together at the White Mountains,” she said, “When Miss Hamilton had the good sense to recommend The Afternoon of Unmarried Life to me.”</p>
<p>“Miss Larcom, whatever are you doing with yourself?  Still tucked away amid the green girls at Wheaton?”</p>
<p>Lucy was surprised at her own eagerness to defend the position she so disliked. “My pupils are quite satisfactory.  And I visit Boston whenever I can.”</p>
<p>“I’m amazed that the author of ‘Hannah Binding Shoes’ feels any need to roam.”</p>
<p>She referred to Lucy’s other great success, a ballad about a woman who grew old sitting by the window and waiting for her sweetheart to return from the sea.  While her marriage was delayed, Hannah supported herself by binding shoes, a common occupation in Lucy’s hometown, as stanza by stanza, she lost her beauty and increased her faith.  The poem appeared in The Crayon and The Knickerbocker simultaneously, just as Lucy despaired of receiving a reply from either magazine.  So instead of being paid for her efforts, she was rewarded with a public outcry against her brazen plagiarism of her own work.</p>
<p>Lucy hated to be reminded of the poem, even though it had been reprinted in several anthologies, memorized by old maids and schoolchildren, and universally praised.  She felt she would never escape the reputation Hannah earned for her, the image of a pitiable spinster waiting for a fulfillment that would never come.</p>
<p>“Oh, I meant to tell thee,” Whittier remarked. “Last month we had another pilgrim come to Amesbury to meet the author of ‘Hannah Binding Shoes.’  Thou wilt be happy to hear that I gave thee full credit and told the poor woman she must go and pay her tribute to you at Wheaton when she could.”</p>
<p>“What an honor it is to live the life of the pen!” Miss Hamilton interrupted.  “I don’t know if Mr. Whittier told you, but I’m thinking of writing a book.  My employer encouraged me to take a leave of absence to try my hand at some little story of my life in the provinces.  Mr. Whittier believes he will be able to interest Mr. Fields in publishing the full account.”<br />
The same promise he had made to Lucy.  Her legs weakened beneath her, her knees locked, and she had to make an effort to remain standing.  So Miss Hamilton, who had never sullied herself by completing any piece of literary work or mailing a single manuscript out to editors, would publish a book before Lucy, who had labored over her poetry through every family tragedy and rude displacement, each menial occupation and painful rejection, since the age of fifteen.</p>
<p>She did not know how she managed to excuse herself and leave the room; only habit, she supposed, empowered her to find her way down the narrow hall to her accustomed chamber, where Elizabeth had left a spray of asters, a pitcher of fresh water, and a note explaining her absence due to her niece’s unexpected illness.  Miss Hamilton, she trusted, would serve as company in her stead, and she wished the two good ladies a lively exchange over their literary endeavors.  So Lucy was to spend the week with Miss Hamilton, hearing about her success as a governess, her powers over influential parties, her reputation as a correspondent, and her promise as a leading literary figure of her age.   Whittier himself appeared to bask in the presence of not one, but two pupils, and delighted in calling his guests into his study, where he read out their works in dramatic tones and corrected their phrases with a point of his finger and a flourish of his wrist.</p>
<p>Lucy was shocked by the enthusiasm with which he assumed Miss Hamilton’s style of speech, and the effeminate affected inflections of her voice.  As he read out her letters, his forehead narrowed, his nostrils expanded, and his dear severe lips pursed together in an alarming expression of sensuality.  What expression did he assume when reading Lucy’s work, she wondered, and, observing him closely, she thought she detected a subtler shift, a movement toward a child’s naïve piety.  Was this, then, his view of her?  If Miss Hamilton was the eternal female, was Lucy destined to be the perpetual child?  At her mature age, how long could she continue to inhabit the role? But if she dared to abandon it, would she retain any place at all in his imagination?</p>
<p>And as the week progressed, Lucy was stunned at the number and variety of Miss Hamilton’s costumes: a grebe fur hat and boa, an English riding habit, a Turkish robe.  And although she could not find a moment to engage Whittier in private conversation, she did have ample opportunity to observe every ornament in Miss Hamilton’s extensive collection: the Italian beads, the French brooch, the pearl necklace with the diamond clasp. These last, given to her as a Christmas gift from her pupils, came attached with a note from her employer, telling her that though she was without a doubt the finest governess he had ever known, he would be selfish to keep such sublime genius smothered in the bosom of his family.</p>
<p>As the days passed, Lucy’s anger grew and the condition of the skin at her throat worsened, until she was forced to cut a wider band of velvet, extended, above and below, with the lace from her petticoat and fastened together with an ivory earring which had lost its mate.  Miss Hamilton, apparently gifted with second sight along with all her other talents, paid particular compliments to this poor item, as if to draw attention to Lucy’s ailment.  Lucy found herself spending longer and longer periods in her room, so that she could loosen the ribbon and re-apply the lunar caustic recommended by her doctor.  The ointment smelled of lead and induced a heavy intoxication of despair.  She felt her courses coming on, somewhat sooner than expected, and that smell, too, reminded her of the impure and suppurating nature of her body.  It would be at least three months before she saw Whittier again, and she could not forgive herself for letting the precious days pass without enjoyment.</p>
<p>One evening, two days before her departure, she wandered out into the garden at sunset, simply to be free of the constant society.  Unable to bear the constriction of the ribbon any longer, she tore it from her neck and began to cry.  “Unwholesome dew,” indeed, she thought, regretting the self -pity that forced yet another unwanted substance from her poor, ruined body.  And yet, even as she reached the lowest point of her nature, the cool wind touched her wound and breathed on her ruined flesh. Then she felt her better self return, and, with it, the power to look outside her own misery and observe the desiccated stems of the few pumpkins left in the garden, their twisted vines arrayed like trailing script.</p>
<p>Beyond the wall, she saw a black coat and a tall hat, then the long legs of her host, and she moved to pull her shawl around her neck.</p>
<p>“My child,” he said, stooping to kiss the top of her head.  “I find thee troubled of late.  Have I done aught to offend thee?”</p>
<p>Lucy could not speak; her voice disappeared inside her damaged throat.  Instead, she set her hand in his and felt the warm rough texture, remembering how Whittier, too, had labored as a boy, chopping wood and husking corn, and how he still kept his hands busy with fire-tending and whittling.  He was not a man to scorn her as a lowly worker; he was not her enemy.  And yet, why did she feel it so, the removal of his approval, as if the very hair and nails were being torn from her body?</p>
<p>He lifted his hand from hers and pointed to the sunset, its pink layers folding into madder and lighting up the fir trees so they shone a vivid bottle green.  How did this sight appear to him, she wondered.  Was it merely a mass of undifferentiated color, or were the shades distorted, as if seen through tinted glass?  Oh, why had she, with her perfect vision, submitted to the judgment of a colorblind man?</p>
<p>“It will be time for sledding before I see thee next, and I do not wish to part with an obstruction between us.”</p>
<p>“You could visit me at Wheaton.” Lucy said, feeling a sliver of her former merriment return.  She realized, with some confusion, that she had dropped the “thou” she generally employed in conversation with her mentor and shivered, as if, by addressing him in this bare fashion, she acknowledged his naked humanity.</p>
<p>“I do not wish to disturb the orthodoxy of thy school with the plain coat and hard doctrine of a Quaker.”</p>
<p>Lucy laughed in spite of herself.  “I believe my colleagues will survive the shock of your stringent opinions and your crow’s robes.”  She had done it again.  This time, even Whittier appeared to notice, acknowledging the omission with a blink of his eye.</p>
<p>“Well, I may call on you, then, the next time I find myself in Norton.”  But Lucy knew that he would never visit her, but only send, as usual, a clever apology in rhymed couplets, excusing himself on account of his insomnia.</p>
<p>“I am sorry I have not been myself,” she said. “The season does not agree with me.”</p>
<p>Here she breathed in to suppress her tears and found herself sneezing instead, doing no favors to her appearance.  He handed her his handkerchief and looked away, allowing her a space of privacy in which to regain her composure.</p>
<p>“Thou art coming to the end of it,” he said, laying his hand on hers.  “And soon thou wilt be a contented jolly bachelor like Elizabeth and myself.”</p>
<p>Her heart squeezed tight, some negligible beast, a muskrat or squirrel, attempting to hide itself in a space too small for its dimensions.  Surely, she was still too young to be discarded as a potential mate.  Even if she did not want to marry, she could not stand to be excluded from the possibility.</p>
<p>“Thou must not underestimate the consolations of the single state.”</p>
<p>Was he confining her to a life of solitude?  At what age had he resolved to live a single life?  And when did he determine this same fate for his sister as well, so that he was not deprived of a hearthside companion? Did he have any right to limit her in this way?  Did he have the right to limit Elizabeth?</p>
<p>She felt the shawl scratch at her throat and the tastes of lead and iron fill her mouth with the unpleasant flavor of her own unworthiness.  Who was she to doubt the intentions of her mentor?</p>
<p>Just at this juncture, Lucy saw Gail Hamilton pass by the window and pull open the shade.  She wore an organza veil over her dark hair and her shapely arms were bare to the shoulder.  Surely she didn’t plan to wear an evening gown to supper in the Whittier’s humble home? After adjusting the curtain, Miss Hamilton allowed her hand to rest on the sash, watching her own flesh in fascination as she slid several bright enamel bracelets up and down her slender arm.  The sight bathed Lucy in jealousy: to be able to display her body and not disguise it.  To enjoy the luxury of stretching her limbs and exercising her intellect.  And yet Miss Hamilton was not a beauty or a genius either.  She was merely a confident if unpleasant woman making the most of her gifts.</p>
<p>“I may find a husband yet,” Lucy said.  “To judge from the romantic rumors surrounding me at Wheaton.”</p>
<p>“They marry thee off to the local beaus, do they?  And dost thou consider them congenial?”</p>
<p>“I have been spoiled by the company of one who agrees with me most.”</p>
<p>Whittier blinked again, caught off guard by the compliment.  “Thou findest Miss Hamilton somewhat garrulous, I fear.”</p>
<p>“She does not suffer from shyness.”</p>
<p>“We have known her family for some time, and she is a good woman, underneath it all, who has shown great forbearance for that rough breed at Washington.”</p>
<p>“And so you will turn her into an authoress?”</p>
<p>Whittier picked up a stick from the garden and began to whittle it, slicing away the bark to reveal the pale wood underneath, rich and moist as the meat of a turkey.  “I may do so, if she has the will.”</p>
<p>“You are very generous with your encouragement,” Lucy said. “I myself, well, I hardly know how I would have continued on without it.”</p>
<p>“Thou wert always a fine girl.  I never had any doubts of thee.”</p>
<p>The compliment, sweet as salve on her wounded flesh, came too late, and Lucy drew the shawl more tightly around her neck and shoulders.</p>
<p>“I must tell thee,” she said.  “I have decided to give up my Western story.”</p>
<p>Whittier looked up from his work.  “Oh?”  He continued whittling, but turned his head slightly, in a listening posture, so that she understood he was allowing her to speak, if she wished, at length.</p>
<p>“And I think I must refrain from sending you my work, at least for a time, so I can begin to sort out my mistakes for myself.”</p>
<p>“Well,” he said.  “Thou must be the judge.”</p>
<p>They sat in silence, then, until the sunset dwindled into a single line of orange on the horizon and Miss Hamilton called them in to supper.  Lucy could not go directly into the dining room, with its rich smells, but slipped into the study, where the blue vase sat on the mantle, its bright stalks of goldenrod going to seed.  A part of her would always remain with Whittier, she knew, and perhaps the best of her, the hopeful girl who thought the Merrimack was made of verses and believed her own poor efforts could be transformed, by the metered motion of the mill wheel, into purest gold.  But she could not allow that young woman, with her childish enthusiasm, to choke out the true poet she might become.  She lifted the flowers from the vase and threw them, with some force, into the fire, watching as the stems took light and the blooms blackened in the blaze.  After a moment’s thought, she pulled the velvet band from her pocket and, removing the ivory earring, dropped that into the fire as well, ridding herself of the last reminder of Miss Hamilton’s unwelcome compliments.  The vase remained cool in her hands, and as she turned it, she felt, in its raised and regular pattern, factory-made like herself, the shape of some new story offering up its form.</p>
