								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mirabelle had painted her right-side cheekbone the same broken capillary hue, backhand bruise to the left, suborbital and slackening. She plunged the chain to the light bulb swaying above the mirror, a sixty watt slumber, and wrinkled the afternoon in footsteps that slanted against the gap-tooth automobile traffic. If a white person noticed, she’d offer, “This is called complexion, this is how black people look, okay?” and if a black person questioned her, she’d say zilch, communicating via omission—ocular terror as the buckled fist floated beyond apices on the stepladder of an hour. Mirabelle was half black, half antiquity—Roman—with her bosom in slings. The razzle of her brown ringlets. The dough of her shoulders. The broad hips that rotated her buttocks on the suggestion-withholding continuum. An avenue of takeouts bilingual tax specialists plus plywood windows zoned commercial downstairs dollar boutiques plus walkup flats with boosted police lock busted buzzer. Mirabelle ordered the meatloaf with mushroom gravy at the counter of the twenty-four-hour lunch counter. After bringing the plate, the waitress, Khadi, said, “Girl!” and reached for Mirabelle’s bruised—not made up—side, but Mirabelle shrugged it out of reach, Khadi’s cupped palm stretching across. Later, out of doors, the bells and bones of rooftops versus the luminous vellum of the sky. Mirabelle’s oversized earrings—aces—spade and heart—bangled in the window of the cellar doorway until she pushed into the narrow beer hall where she tended a dozen taps. She waddled a quarter keg of porter to the tap where a quarter keg of strong ale had kicked. The bouncer, Jesse, arrived in beret and vest, so Mirabelle poured two tumblers of whisky they clapped atop the bar before shooting. College boys appeared. They said, “Natty Boh’s my go to brew, Brah,” before they left without ordering. Her homey, Apples, showed up, in Adidas: shoes, cap, shirt, duffel. “Girl!” he said, gesturing to her cheek, but she raised her palms, flat, like the Scales of Justice: “It’s complexion, Apples, this is the way black people look, okay?” He slapped her five, a small packet between them, and Mirabelle excused herself to the ladies room, where the commode did not flush. She fixed Apples an apple-back shooter when she looped back, behind the bar, a tumbler of whisky pursued by some concentrate. His namesake. “The dilly pickle!” said Apples, gorging and approving. She logged into Facebook. She liked a couple dozen statuses rapidly before changing her mind, unliking them rapidly. Whitney Houston had just passed, Mirabelle played some Whitney from her iTunes, “I want to dance with somebody,” she joked, “with somebody who beats me.” Apples said, “Huh? I got to jingle. Caught ya.” He goosed it up the steps—“Granny Smith!” went Jessie, outside—before Apples joined a thickening belt of evening-goers. Nobody clapped down the concrete runners to the cellar, then, but if one did, it might’ve been the guy, with a florescent, electric expression to taunt a sketch artist and a girth of fist like Ali or Louis, Mirabelle admitted—it had once excited her.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I went to the farthest brink, as you advised, to launch the spear you so often spoke of, and, Lucretius, I tell you that it hit hard against a boundary–precisely what we do not know–and spear after spear fell against it to slide to the bottom of the universe.</p>
<p>We may say that this wall and what is beyond–if anything–is still the universe, but what of it? That which seals us in is there, manifested by the clank of spear-tips ringing against some metal and the slender weapons clattering down. We are bounded.</p>
<p>Old friend, forgive my conceit. You are long gone but to write you gives my thoughts a chance at order. Order seems far away.</p>
<p>For another impossibility you declared, is, in fact, the case: Everything has fallen. You said it could not happen but it has. Everything in this finite cosmos has tumbled–and perhaps some is still to fall–to the floor of the cosmos. This we saw before we returned, as cold, rocky moons and terrible, flaming suns–such shades of red!–streamed with us, shaking our vessel like an oil-jar cork bobbing in the wake of Neptune’s passing. We had to wend our way through narrow passages between worlds crashed against each other, a labyrinth in the heavens. Terrible but not without beauty were the canyons formed between the mountains of one earth and the mountains of another. For there were gaps, and we found them, sometimes aided by birds of passage and men not of our world.</p>
<p>We found our way home.</p>
<p>We so yearned to leave that sealed <em>navis oneraria</em>, with its sails to catch starwind–given to us by that strange god of whom I may write later–and, back on this earth, this earth, we gladly found our sea-faring ship intact. Nobleman and slave alike delighted in pulling oars, returning us to gray-green waters, dark skies and the salt-sprayed rocks of home. More time has passed here than for us in flight, such paradoxes abound! Icy worlds have even quenched the sun to a sweet warm glow.</p>
<p>I must go. As I write, a lunar mountain crumbles against a shore cliff. A fine dust rains. I must cover again my dying garden.<br />
–M.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Her love for Mentos began in Taipei when a conference colleague offered one to her son to keep him content while Kay viewed the Palace Museum exhibits—the boy held the flattened orb in his small palm before reverently placing it on his tongue. The colleague offered one to Kay, too, and while staring into cases displaying translucent Ju ware and celadons, Kay bit into it, chewed it like gum for a moment, then slowly played it over her teeth until the mass dissolved into a few crystals, then a mere cool memory.</p>
<p>A year later when she returned to Taiwan on vacation with her family, the taste for them returned. She bought a pack from a convenience store and doled them out as they toured city sights, offering white orbs to her children and husband to cope with the odors of stinky tofu and duck blood or the sight of unrecognizable meats under sauce. She presented them to her family in taxis when they were stuck in traffic, and on the putrid bus riding south from Kaoshiung when the ride grew hotter, dustier, longer and the ocean stubbornly refused to appear. Soon she found herself producing the mints after every not-entirely-identifiable meal.</p>
<p>Back home in Japan, the taste for the chewy mints lingered. She sought them out along her usual routes and began to store a roll in her purse to keep handy, producing them on a delayed train, a hot walk, any sort of frustration. She loved how the faces of her children and husband lit up, how they thanked her at such moments—<em>Mentos moments</em> they joked.</p>
<p>Kay began to note which kiosks sold mint flavor and which only grape; she didn’t like grape or that new apple abomination. And she learned that not one of the three convenience stores by the train station in her neighborhood sold mint. The kiosk by the station at her university did. The pharmacy did. The grocery store did not. She began buying two rolls at a time, stocking up, just to be safe.</p>
<p>More and more Mentos moments seemed to occur. Not quite prepared for class? She ate a Mentos. Tired and hungry but dinner yet to prepare? She ate a Mentos. The children soon learned that she always had a Mentos on hand.</p>
<p>But too soon the children no longer seemed so pleased when she offered one. They didn’t want a second as she always did. Her husband often refused them. “You eat too many of those things,” he said.</p>
<p>Kay began to eat them in secret. She kept spare rolls in her briefcase, her purse and her underwear drawer. She became adept at keeping them from getting stuck in her teeth. She learned that she could eat one in the time it took to go from the university gates to her office, but from her office to her seminar classrooms was half a mint—she took attendance with a clump stowed by a molar. Grading papers late at night, sometimes she would eat three. Then three more.</p>
<p>When Kay took her son to start university in New York City she kept three packets in her handbag at all times. They had many Mentos moments—as they sank down into the back seats of taxi cabs, while deciphering cell phone plans, after opening a bank account, and as they stood in long snaking lines to buy sheets, towels, pillows, shelving, a lamp. After she’d bid a final good-bye to him for the four full months until his winter break when he would return to Japan for nineteen days, she bought two rolls and promptly ate all fourteen orbs from one pack on a park bench.</p>
<p>In Japan Kay missed him terribly. Her daughter was still home. Her husband was home. She was not entirely alone. But her son was the one who had truly understood those Mentos moments. Shared in them. Appreciated them.</p>
<p>She began consuming half-rolls routinely and panicked when she ran low. Soon she was doing four rolls a week. Her daughter caught her out one night when she came down to use the bathroom and found her mother eating one for each paper she graded, the orbs lined up before her. “You’ve got to stop, Mom. They’re just sugar. Try some sugarless mints.” But Kay needed the chewiness, not just the mint.</p>
<p>She kept the Mentos secret from everyone now—hidden deep in the inner zip pockets of her bags. She never doled them out; she let her husband and daughter think she’d given them up. To herself she justified them as diet mints, since they helped control her appetite. She managed to cut down to two rolls a week, and some weeks she lasted days without eating a single orb, but then she’d have a Mentos moment and suddenly half a roll would disappear.</p>
<p>In December, she took a day off work to meet her son at the airport. She made a full day’s expedition of it, saving money by taking the local train. As she neared the airport, she felt conspicuous without any luggage besides her briefcase of papers to grade.</p>
<p>But in an inside zipper pocket she had two rolls of Mentos. She would be good, she kept telling herself. She would be good. She would wait until the train ride back when they’d nearly reached Tokyo, or even Yokohama, and they still had all the way to go to Ofuna—so far after such a long plane ride, before she casually reached into her bag and offered him one.</p>
<p>Then she would watch his face light up in appreciation, full of cool memories.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t she?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rebecca is moon surfing.  Knees bent and always bending, she holds her arms out in an L, a backwards L, then slides them into a V.  Her feet glide weightless along the narrow stone wall that reminds her of cream cheese.</p>
<p>“Oooh, I’m passing over Egypt!” she says.</p>
<p>“Careful!” he says.</p>
<p>“I am looking down,” she says.  “It is so amazing.  I see pyramids.  I see camels.”</p>
<p>“Take plenty of pictures,” he says.</p>
<p>“Now I am passing over Africa!” she says.  “Daddy, what would I see in Africa?”</p>
<p>“Well, for starters,” he says, “you might see Egypt.”</p>
<p>“Daddy!” she says.  “You just tripped me off my moon.  And it was the best moon of the day.  You don’t always just get such a good moon.  You have to be so lucky.  Now I have to start all over again.”</p>
<p>“But you love starting over,” he says.  “You always have a way of getting lucky again.”</p>
<p>“You’re right,” she says.</p>
<p>“You’re the best,” he says.</p>
<p>“Oh dear,” she says.  “I’m sailing over Italy.  It’s morning there.  I want to land so I can eat cookies for breakfast.”</p>
<p>She holds her body like an ocean surfer riding an enormous and perfect wave, her legs relaxed and bouncing like coil springs, her slender torso twisting with verve, a big smile widening on her little face, her head dancing, her shoulder-length hair vibrating like gold filaments.  But her arms, her skinny arms, are not like a surfer’s arms.  He watches how they steady her, floating, more like wings.  He doesn’t know how she does it.  She actually looks as if she is riding the moon.  He loses himself in a thought about her, about how she does it.</p>
<p>“Daddy!” she shouts.  “You’re not looking at me!”</p>
<p>“Of course I am,” he says.</p>
<p>“No,” she says.  “You closed your eyes.  I saw you close your eyes.”  She stops.  She is no longer moon surfing.  She is just a girl, crossing her arms, frowning, stomping on a stone wall, her head turned down.</p>
<p>“I was watching the whole time,” he says.</p>
<p>“I saw,” she says.</p>
<p>“I don’t see how it’s possible,” he says.</p>
<p>“With my little brown eyes,” she says.  “I saw.  You closed them.”</p>
<p>“Maybe I closed them for a second,” he says.  “I was thinking….About you.”</p>
<p>“Still,” she says.  “That’s not how this game goes.  You have to watch.  Or I fall from the moon.  Do you want me to fall from the moon?”</p>
<p>“I don’t want you to fall from anything, ever,” he says.</p>
<p>“Oh, Daddy,” she says.  “Then keep your eyes open.  Remember, I am still in Italy.”</p>
<p>“Yes, you’re eating breakfast,” he says.</p>
<p>“Cookies!” she says.</p>
<p>The sun is gone, behind the ridge.  The red fire of its descent is a billowy glow.  The leaves of the trees are threading the wind, which is picking up with a hint of meanness.  Oaks, mainly – strong, imposing oaks.  But also a large sugar maple, which is leaning, looking ominous with its rough scaly bark.</p>
<p>“Could you make your way to France for dinner?” he asks.  “We have to go in soon.  You should stop for the night.  You should stop in France.”</p>
<p>“No,” she says.  “I am not going to France.  Not ever!” she says.  “Because they eat pigeons.”</p>
<p>“They are not the same pigeons you see,” he says.  “They are special pigeons.”</p>
<p>“Who cares?” she says.  “Don’t try to tell it’s different if it’s still pigeon.”</p>
<p>“France has the Louvre, a great museum.  It has some of the most beautiful art in the world.”</p>
<p>“Okay, that’s important,” she says.  “But they eat pigeon and frogs legs and – ooh! – slimy snails.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” he says, “Forget France.  How about “Israel?”</p>
<p>“What’s that?” she says, her head turning toward something she hears.</p>
<p>The woods are unusually quiet.  No crows crowing, no woodpeckers pecking, no squirrels crinkling leaves in the woods.  The occasional car is passing on a nearby road, not their road, which is a dead end, but the windy road, the road into town.</p>
<p>A siren is sounding, getting louder.  It is approaching.  They don’t usually hear sirens in the<br />
country.  They hear them in the city, but not here.  They look at each other, as if to say something bad must have happened nearer and nearer and nearer to where they stand.  They look around, each of them in a direction, to see if they can hear how close.  But they can only hear.  Then the siren starts sounding less loud.</p>
<p>“Lucky.” she says.  “It’s going away.  It is not here.”</p>
<p>They stand in their stillness.</p>
<p>“Lucky is better than good,” he says.</p>
<p>“Good is my favorite,” she says.</p>
<p>Her arms are down.  Her knees are straight.  She is turning her head in all directions.</p>
<p>“I lost it, Dad,” she says, “that good moon.”</p>
<p>“You can find another,” he says.</p>
<p>“Dad,” she says, “I want to know why God took Aaron.”</p>
<p>“God wanted him up in heaven,” he says.</p>
<p>“But God is also down here,” she says.  “God is everywhere.  Isn’t he everywhere?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” he says.</p>
<p>“So?” she says.</p>
<p>“Heaven,” he says.  “I said heaven.”  He almost says heaven dammit.</p>
<p>“Dad, does plastic die?” she says.</p>
<p>“Do you mean what happens if you put it in the ground?” he says.</p>
<p>“I guess that’s what I mean,” she says.</p>
<p>“Then you mean does it disintegrate?”</p>
<p>“I guess,” she says.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he says.  “But it takes a long time.”</p>
<p>“How long?” she asks.</p>
<p>“I’ll have to look it up,” he says.</p>
<p>“Don’t you know?” she asks.</p>
<p>“I think so.  But I think it depends on whether it’s the thin clear plastic of a water bottle or the hard black plastic of a coffee thermos.”</p>
<p>“The thick one,” she says.  “I don’t think that ever goes away.”</p>
<p>“You’re probably right,” he says.</p>
<p>“Dad, I wish we were made of hard plastic, but still ourselves,” she says.</p>
<p>He says nothing, only looks at her, at the seriousness in her eyes.  He doesn’t know how he will pursue this conversation.  He, still unready – always unready.</p>
<p>“I wish there wasn’t school,” she says.  He is happy she has made this transition, away from the gravity of death to the lightness of feeble wishes.</p>
<p>“Oh,” he says.</p>
<p>“No school,” she says.  “Just friends.”</p>
<p>He thinks he is off the hook.  No serious conversation, just a school girl’s little sermon.</p>
<p>“And I wish parents couldn’t go out without their children, like to restaurants.  “Do you wish that?” she says.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he says, not thinking, just answering, stuck in the habit of always intoning yes when she speaks.</p>
<p>“You do?” she says, jumping.</p>
<p>There’s a rustle, a sound bigger than a squirrel’s nervous foraging.</p>
<p>“Coyote!” she says.  “Dad, it could be a coyote!”</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s a coyote,” he says.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she says.  “It is.”</p>
<p>“Even if it is a coyote, it’s harmless,” he says.</p>
<p>“No, every animal has a heart,” she says.</p>
<p>“I said harmless, not heartless,” he says.</p>
<p>“I know what you said, Dad,” she says.  “Nothing with a heart is harmless.  That’s what I’m saying.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For David Parrish</p>
<p>What finally gets me is the Volkswagen bus parked in front of my neighbor’s house, a bright green near-neon thing screaming Spring! Spring! just days after my neighbor’s son has died in Mexico, been killed, I mean, murdered during a robbery.  It happens on a Wednesday, our neighbor emails us on Thursday; by Friday, there’s a Fox news van parked on our street and on Sunday, a reporter-friend is calling asking for clues.  Nobody’s talking, I said, not the neighbor, not me, not us; all I can tell you is that the other paper messed things up, names, details.  But she’s got news for me: the killer was let out of jail, bribery, 5 grand to swap clothes with another inmate, are you kidding me; Spring Break Turns Tragic the local headline shouts. Out of deference, I stare straight ahead as I enter and leave my home; I haven’t seen my neighbor in days.  “They just left,” my husband said tonight after taking out the recycling, “dressed in black.”  But that’s not the whole of the story—what gets me is how goddamn positive my neighbor is, how unavoidably clearly he’s able to look at the whole thing.  After my father died, I wandered around in a haze for months, bitter, lost.  And this is where I already see David’s gift—in the way his father openly mourns and rejoices his 21-year-old son’s short life.  Stunned by the strange beauty of it all, I can’t help but think Well maybe he’s already done it: accomplished everything he came here for, touched the lives he was meant to touch.  Fifteen years after my own father’s death, I sometimes wonder if he touched any lives at all.  What is it about this world, this crazy life, redemption What makes us that person others want to hold touch turn away from Scream as we look in the rear view mirror on a quiet snowy spring day.  Whose eyes are we seeing, and what are we missing?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The body flew on a different plane, arriving in Detroit two days ago, at 7:37AM.  She tracked its arrival online.  Not a soldier or a famous politician, just her husband, age thirty, suddenly dead.</p>
<p>His mother wanted him buried in Detroit.  Did it matter where someone’s dead body was?  Did it matter that someone’s dead body ended up in the place they had fled?</p>
<p>Now she was in suburban Detroit, being carried along an anonymous highway in his mother’s Lincoln.  People drove as if they were tense, feeling the crush of that low, grey sky she remembered from their visit two Christmases ago.   The graveside service was in an hour, followed by a “celebration of life” at a country club.  There would probably be balloons released outside, heartfelt notes tied to them with ribbon.   She stared at the parade of silver-paned office buildings out the window.   His mother’s voice was something broken that wouldn’t stop making noise.</p>
<p>Finally they reached the cemetery, that modern kind, with stones flat in the ground to make mowing easy.  The spot his mother selected seemed exposed, exactly in the center.  She was taller than any of the slender trees.</p>
<p>People pressed her hand, clutched limp tissues.  There were old high school girlfriends, all pretty.  Though it was cold, no hats.   The box with the body in front, blanketed with white roses.   A stand displaying his smiling graduation photo.  A CD of songs he wrote for his college band, The Elements.  The scene felt arranged, like a movie set of a sad funeral.  She imagined everyone at home afterwards, sponging off make-up, peeling away costumes, slipping into bathrobes to relax after this hard day of work.</p>
<p>A minister with a square head spoke.  God this, heaven that.  She’d heard it all before.<br />
His mother wept so loudly she startled the crows looping overhead.</p>
<p>When she exhaled, frost clouded the air.</p>
<p>Later, his mother pulled up to the airport curb and said, “Promise you’ll come visit,” and they both knew she wouldn’t.  She watched people wheeling black suitcases, in a hurry to leave Detroit.  Though she didn’t believe in God or heaven or worshiping a flat stone, she half-envied those who did, those who thought it could be so simple.  She said to her former mother-in-law, “Maybe spring.”</p>
<p>“The marker will be in then,” his mother said.</p>
<p>“It was a beautiful ceremony,” she said.  “I’m so glad.  All those Mylar balloons in the sky.”</p>
<p>“Did you get a photo?” his mother asked.</p>
<p>She nodded, patting her coat pocket as if a phone was in there.  “There’s just one last thing.” She hadn’t cried today, and it was important that she not cry as she said, “It was bugging me the whole time that maybe they’d put him in upside down.”</p>
<p>“Upside down?”</p>
<p>“That his head was where his feet should be.”</p>
<p>“They wouldn’t do that,” his mother said.  “They don’t make those kinds of mistakes.  There’s hinges on one side.”</p>
<p>“I kept thinking about it,” she said, which was true.  “I couldn’t get it out of my head.”</p>
<p>His mother spoke urgently:  “It doesn’t happen like that.”</p>
<p>“Don’t lots of things happen that we think won’t happen?”</p>
<p>His mother tightened her face.  “Have a safe trip.”</p>
<p>The sound of the car door opening, then closing, was loud.  Strange not to have luggage, to float so lightly.</p>
<p>On the flight home, she knew there’d be a time she might wish she hadn’t acquiesced to the anger nudging her to speak those unforgivable words to her former mother-in-law.  But that wasn’t today.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Have you ever had a ‘pauletate’?</em></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><em>Do you know what an ‘armournte’ is?</em></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><em>If you were given a bag of wool what would you do with it?</em></p>
<p>Bury it out by a river, or throw it into the treetops on a lonely hillside.</p>
<p><em>Why lonely?</em></p>
<p>I don’t know. I didn’t make it lonely.</p>
<p><em>Have you ever walked on a lonely hillside?</em></p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p><em>Was light filtering through the trees?</em></p>
<p>I was standing there on the muddy bank. A little pond, un étang boueux, and the pinpricks of starlight reflecting in the water.</p>
<p><em>And so the haphazard starlight was in the trees?</em></p>
<p>If you want to say that. Some of them were fishing for freshwater gar. Night fishing. They would pull these terrible ancient monsters, two-feet long, out of the water, and their teeth, I remember this, they trained a flashlight to show their dinosaur mouths, and then they would cut their heads off with a hatchet. They said they were trash fish.</p>
<p><em>Were the trees beautiful?</em></p>
<p>The trees were stoic before the death of the gars. Everybody was pretty drunk. I didn’t think I was drunk. But I had that felt-packed feeling. I was interested in everything around me but unable to reach it. This is how I remember drunkenness.</p>
<p><em>Have you ever been to or do you know of a state or country called ‘Monbaica’?</em></p>
<p>No. It all happened thirty years ago. It wasn’t really much of a hillside. It was Central<br />
Texas. My girlfriend and I were in the process of breaking up, but we didn’t know it. No drama. She was smoking pot with some of the others. I was by the pond watching the gars get pulled out of the water. The hill behind us lay a little to the left. I think we were both twenty years old.</p>
<p><em>Have you ever seen a horse riding on a boxcar?</em></p>
<p>Maybe in a movie. I remember the starlight pinpricking the surface of the lake. I thought I was seeing something that would matter. My girlfriend is dead now. It was years later. She had married. I had married. All that. Some kind of asthmatic attack. People think of breaking up in a certain way—of being together and breaking up. But the real breakup comes with life, and can come at any time. That may sound trite, but there’s an attachment to life you feel in a relationship, and then there’s the attachment to life itself, and they’re analogous in certain ways, though in the most critical way, of course, different. When I think about it now, I wonder if I wasn’t more aware of our impending breakup than I realized.</p>
<p><em>Have you ever held a salamander?</em></p>
<p>The salamander may experience the warmth of your hand as discomfort. Look, maybe I was worried she was flirting with somebody when she was smoking pot. Not that I remember who they were. Just some people. Like I said, no drama. We weren’t exactly shooting the blindfold off the Zeitgeist back then. Our relationship was genuinely inconsequential. I moved to New York that fall. She was supposed to join me. I think we both knew it wasn’t going to happen. Who we were just wouldn’t fit inside the attractions that had pinned us together in the first place.</p>
<p><em>Then calamity is the touchstone …</em></p>
<p>No. Not at all. New York unveiled the advanced field for the failure I craved, and she wanted the kind of life you can have on an open prairie—fields and sunsets and wildflowers.<br />
All that. All very easy to mock—though of the two of us I’m quite sure mine was the life that added up to the lesser integer. This is all embarrassing to relate. Yet when I learned of her death (a friend called to tell me) I found myself falling down subway steps. I mean that almost literally. I began sneaking into this abandoned station—I won’t say where because they’d block it off and then there’d be one less place where people could go when they feel like falling down steps. Actually the line hadn’t operated in decades. I’ll only mention that there was crushed stone and concrete blocks and shafts of light slicing through the air vents and this incredibly fine dust everywhere. All that cold spring, I’d slip away and just sit there. Getting in wasn’t easy.</p>
<p><em>Have you ever seen people dancing in a field and then they’d smile and their teeth would be covered with dust?</em></p>
<p>I doubt it. There was a grate, a narrow crawlspace—fortunately I’m very thin, and I was able to dangle by my arms before dropping to the actual platform. I panicked the first time because I thought I was trapped. But then I found a forklift pallet and turned it on end, and that’s how I could get out. Often I’d scrape myself a bit, and I’d hide the scrapes from my wife. There were cables snaking around and cable spools. The tracks were covered in dank trash. The support columns were deeply rusted. You had to be careful not to get caught in the wires or trip on the concrete blocks, but some of the old carvings were there, several affixed to the wall and others lying on the platform, Corinthian type carvings and some faces of what I took to be sea gods, so you had the feeling you were in the ruins of some ancient Rome but one that had been submerged like Atlantis, the feeling of being underwater, and then I’d find a concrete block and just sit.</p>
<p><em>Have you ever held your hand in very cold water till it ached?</em></p>
<p>Yes. Somebody else was down there only once. He came out of the tunnel, which means he’d likely been wandering through tracks and tunnels for miles. He rested for a few minutes on the opposite platform, an average looking guy in a blue work shirt and canvas pants, then he continued down the track. I don’t think he saw me. Otherwise I was alone, and I felt my mind was blank, but I doubt that was true. I kept looking at this one carving in particular of a sea god or maybe it was Odysseus.</p>
<p><em>Ramanunni has a story about Manubam Bibi, the saint or demigod who drowned in order to save a group of fishermen from drowning. Do you know it?</em></p>
<p>Someone sent me an email on it. I think the fishermen dug her grave and then used their own clothing to cover her body.</p>
<p><em>What does it mean?</em></p>
<p>The desire to give harbor or safety. Or maybe the story shows how tenderness is the only thing between us and the harshness of death. The carving lay on its side on the platform floor, the face cracked in half, and I would sit on my concrete block for hours, and I couldn’t keep my eyes off it. I think sometimes tears came to my eyes. I’ve still not told my wife what I was doing when I snuck away. And what was I doing? Was I even thinking of her? I mean my former girlfriend. Was this grieving? And yet why did it feel like emptiness? Was I responding to some general proposition of death, or the loss of youth? But she was there too, along with the grief, if I can call it that, in undeniable specificity, the actual her, whom I had touched, and we had touched, and loved, swam in a flooded lake once, climbed a bowl of sand to a limestone ledge in the desert, been hit by hail running to our separate cars after some function, seen lights in the distance on odd tangled lakeshores here and there in different counties, and yet she whom I had seen only once in the intervening thirty years, at a party, again in Central Texas, where consequential people had gathered to drink wine and congratulate themselves was also not there. Not there. (And what were they congratulating themselves for? For making it through? For burning their youth up but not themselves? For having waited it out till the blessings of heaven showered upon them?) Anyway, I wish I could get across just how it was that night by the little étang boueux when I went to take a piss, walking up the hill into the trees, and there I stood, ‘the blank face of nature’ before me, the piss rolling or streaming out of me, the deep and silent woods, the dusty dry heat but with some cooling feeling in the leaves of the trees, and like you said, I guess starlight, though what I remember was the dark and the stillness and the ‘blank face.’</p>
<p><em>Do you understand the meaning of the word ‘creciundular’?</em></p>
<p>No. I sometimes wonder what I was really thinking then.</p>
<p><em>What are the odds that the biblical Burning Bush was a creosote bush?</em></p>
<p>I would say not good.</p>
<p><em>If a motorcar is a vehicle with a motor, what is a motor aspen?</em></p>
<p>A motorized tree cart?</p>
<p><em>A cart before the hearse?</em></p>
<p>A hearse off course on a motor course?</p>
<p><em>As sung by Jasper Johns?</em></p>
<p>When I came down the hill that night I heard shouts and laughter in the distance. I remember that.</p>
<p><em>You may leave if you’ve answered all the questions.</em></p>
