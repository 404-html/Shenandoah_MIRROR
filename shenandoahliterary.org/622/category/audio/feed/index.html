<p>Maybe vampires hear an annunciatory trumpet solo.<br />
Maybe they gather at the customary tourist traps<br />
like a blanket of pink flamingos plating a lake<br />
and lake shore by the tens of thousands to drink.<br />
The whole, tacky blood circus is theme-park stuff<br />
and as Disneyesque as lifting the lid on a casket<br />
to flit about sampling the inexhaustible offerings<br />
of O Positive like the Sunday brunch at IHOP.<br />
But if you had a booming, amphitheatrical voice<br />
and had been recently rescued from the grave—<br />
if you wore the republic of the dark like a cape<br />
at Halloween, all bets would be off by the signage<br />
for Paradise Tire &amp; Service, a neon-green royal palm.<br />
Bela Lugosi could materialize on a trailer-park lawn<br />
and the locals would miss it, though lapdogs howled<br />
as kingdoms rose and fell. You could say a kingdom<br />
of fangs glows and drips red by the broken temples<br />
and wide, well-lit aisles of Best Buy and Wal-Mart.<br />
By the shadowed homeless holding up placards<br />
hand-lettered in English, as if the kind-hearted<br />
of the nations of the world spoke one language<br />
and could be counted on to forgive misspellings,<br />
bad syntax that announces one life is never enough.<br />
The resurrection of the body is tough everywhere.<br />
In the Sunshine State, despite eons to shake off loss,<br />
a body carries the added burden of perpetual labor<br />
and cyclical, inescapable debt. The dead know this.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/622/files/2013/01/Buckeye-.mp3">Audio recording of Buckeye Read by the Author</a><br />
It didn’t make sense to invest so much<br />
in a pocketed nut. But for ten sure springs,<br />
my grandmother withdrew a buckeye<br />
from her purse and placed it in my palm.</p>
<p>I was a mother three times over,<br />
my grandmother long buried, before I missed<br />
them. This morning, passing her home, I saw<br />
a bright fruit hanging, strange as Fatima’s Eye</p>
<p>and trespassed beyond the present<br />
resident’s curb to glimpse close what I knew<br />
I’d never seen. Who’d have bet by dinner<br />
I’d tell my children how gamblers hollow</p>
<p>and fill them with mercury? Or that I’d<br />
finally grasp the weight of her bargain,<br />
grace that can’t be banked, or left in a will,<br />
an annual transaction turned to spare me</p>
<p>bad marriages, collisions, infants sick<br />
and dead. Lush as plums in split suede shells,<br />
her buckeyes still fall where she caught them<br />
dark in the cup of her own luckless palm.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/622/files/2013/01/Luke-Johnson-Rembrandts-Light.mp3">Luke Johnson reads Rembrandt&#8217;s Light</a><br />
We’re crossing Depression Era bridges</p>
<p>and she is becoming more beautiful,</p>
<p>driving with both hands on the wheel</p>
<p>as we head inland: away from saltwater eddies</p>
<p>where every few months an empty row boat</p>
<p>falls victim to the current, recirculates</p>
<p>against the rocky shore for weeks</p>
<p>before splintering its wooden hull</p>
<p>on the land’s dull and uncompromising teeth.</p>
<p>Rembrandt’s light always came from the left.</p>
<p>He painted and hoped the canvas would keep</p>
<p>his shadows, the eye drawn to where the flesh</p>
<p>was softest and the most tired: just beneath</p>
<p>the eyes where we keep our hurt and our joy,</p>
<p>where we seldom touch for how easily</p>
<p>the thin skin can bruise. Evergreens</p>
<p>invite us to agree on beauty. The fenced-off pier</p>
<p>begs for passengers. She says the light</p>
<p>is <em>bleeding from the clouds</em>. The pavement,</p>
<p>the undersides of leaves: every darkness shining.</p>

<em>Composting is next to godliness.</em><br />
&#8211; My father</p>
<p>Take your own advice: if Orpheus is in it<br />
or vultures (the impulse there is the same:</p>
<p>skull picked clean by pain, mutilated<br />
song, a dark hour circled, regret baring</p>
<p>poison-jeweled fangs) throw it out. If there<br />
is cooking (like the one about the woman</p>
<p>stirring boiling polenta for two, stunned<br />
by that volcanic hiss and bubble, its promise</p>
<p>that if she abandons attentiveness<br />
the house will burn down) that becomes</p>
<p>a metaphor for love, throw it out. If<br />
it is sentimental, overly lovely, throw it out.</p>
<p>(My guilt glows like the skin of the hornworm,<br />
incandescent, spined, bright as the bolt</p>
<p>of lightning which tunes the horizon<br />
with its silver tines.)  But our darlings</p>
<p>are delicate cats with many lives, and I<br />
don’t buy into euthanasia. This is an age</p>
<p>that dies and revives. I know a single garlic<br />
clove will live forever. I salvage and in lieu</p>
<p>of prayer I compost. I buy Ball jars. I root<br />
cellar, I hoard, I shotgun. I’ll bury in the yard.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/622/files/2013/01/Standard-Time.mp3">James Brasfield reads Standard Time</a>Quartered deadfall from the hills, oak cut<br />
to length, fresh still the smell of woodgrain,<br />
a cord to heft, to calibrate angle and curve,<br />
to fit, to balance high the stack<br />
in rootless equilibrium.</p>
<p>As if to make a windbreak, stone on stone,<br />
beside a mound of leaves—each leaf from its birth<br />
notch to the black meld of compost—<br />
I build on the birch I cut<br />
and parceled last summer</p>
<p>and on the apple limbs trimmed,<br />
their evenly spaced<br />
woodpecker’s chiseled wells—<br />
instinct’s measured patience,<br />
the belly’s need.</p>
<p>Migrant, flocking in, or piling up,<br />
clouds west of here, gray on gray<br />
arrive from the sky pyre<br />
dying out—the sky a vault now,<br />
a stone basin overturned.</p>
<p>Back again, yesterday’s rain<br />
to freeze, to splinter,<br />
to rot what is, comes slowly on<br />
the wind above the chill stillness.<br />
The stack is made,</p>
<p>the tarp spread over for the rain,<br />
for snow on this starless night at this return<br />
to Standard Time, years of sap-driven life to burn,<br />
to keep a self warm, to sleep awhile<br />
down through ages of root and stone.</p>

We make out awkwardly on the bed.<br />
And her shifting weight is a tide or the back of the bus.</p>
<p><em>Have you seen her lately?</em><br />
<em>Not since she moved out.</em></p>
<p>When we go to a costume party together she<br />
wears a lycra body suit and duct tapes a dildo</p>
<p>to her crotch. It bumps against me in the darkness<br />
like a bottlenose dolphin or a chair-lift.</p>
<p>Outside the party she kisses me again, her<br />
costume insistent. She has been dead for</p>
<p>two and a half years. She lay down to sleep<br />
at thirty-six and her heart failed. Like it</p>
<p>failed a test or failed a warrant or failed to<br />
come in to work that day like everyone else.</p>
<p>My fingernail split down to the cuticle and<br />
she climbed into my bed at dawn smelling</p>
<p>of chemicals and the last stand of the hospice.<br />
She moved out on my birthday and I ripped</p>
<p>up the note she wrote. I ripped up the note<br />
she left me that she wrote me, when she left.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/622/files/2012/11/Rope-for-Shenandoah.mp3"> Hinemoana Baker &#8211; Rope </a><br />
He roped me, he roped me twice the second time<br />
it caught, fell at the right angle and landed around the bones<br />
of my dress. He roped me from the East like light rising, from the<br />
West like light falling, in the arrangement of his cutlery,<br />
the bubbling land moving on its plates. Without words<br />
or entertainment and without true silence he<br />
roped me in the mud, in the kind of mud people call sucking,<br />
or stinking, it sticks to one’s body, one’s feathers and folds.<br />
I couldn’t bear the thought of soup or vast pastures, he roped me<br />
without heart or dancing, when he called me his <em>wriggly little girl</em>.<br />
It was like freezing, when he roped me, I watched a thousand<br />
doors clap shut in the clouds. He roped me and began to pull,<br />
in spite of his own injuries, and I allowed him to be lonely.<br />
With a shovel I buried the turquoise feathers, warm from the sun,<br />
<em>winter in the blood</em>. In my mind I wrote letters to all those I’d<br />
wronged, <em>I want to be buried with a family resemblance.</em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/622/files/2012/11/in-corners-under-frames-1.mp3"> Kay Cooke &#8211; in corners, under frames </a><br />
It concentrates, this house, straining with the effort<br />
to remember it once had a green roof<br />
and a garden full of pink phlox.<br />
It&#8217;s my mother-in-law&#8217;s childhood home</p>
<p>now remaindered as a holiday house<br />
and empty most of the year. She remembers<br />
the tin sheet hammered over the window-frame<br />
after the glass broke, how the wind howled through.</p>
<p>Seventy-something years on and three owners later<br />
we&#8217;re here on a day stoked with autumn,<br />
invited to look around.<br />
My mother-in-law notes the things that are the same;</p>
<p>the rotund hot-water cylinder like a rolled-up sleeve,<br />
the wardrobe, its sweet metal catch. A brass hook.<br />
“After coming back inside from the farm,<br />
Pop would hang his coat on that very peg.&#8221;</p>
<p>As we look around, the present owner&#8217;s foxy<br />
snuffles and whines at the smell of mice<br />
behind the skirting boards. Outside<br />
there&#8217;s a persistent view of rocks, tussock</p>
<p>and the lake, of the pear tree with its back to us,<br />
huge and self-important.<br />
The owner tells us that it was in the &#8217;70s<br />
when they first looked at this house.</p>
<p>On a bitter day of snow, she said.<br />
She remembers the sputtering open fire<br />
with two sticks for fuel<br />
and the man and woman desperate to sell,</p>
<p>shivering with the disappointment<br />
of dead strawberry plants. As she describes it all<br />
she points to things unseen,<br />
in corners and under frames.</p>
<p>“I remember it well,” she said,<br />
“The man sat at the table, right there,&#8221;<br />
she outlines its shadow, “right there,<br />
eating Weet-Bix with gravy.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note: Sometimes a poem just falls out of an actual occurrence described verbatim. My mother-in-law had long wanted to visit her childhood home in Kingston, a small town at the southern arm of Lake Wakapitu. When the chance came to do so, we took it. The surge of memories for her was overwhelming. It was a special thing to be there with her and to be able to place her as a small girl living in this house, nevertheless the most striking image I took away with me was the extraordinary (if unpalatable) one of the man eating a plate of breakfast grain with gravy.</p>

you yellowgreen<br />
hills roll seductively<br />
in the early morning</p>
<p>light<br />
you appear<br />
in folds of earthflesh</p>
<p>and undulate<br />
in the early afternoon<br />
like buttocks</p>
<p>in olivedrab<br />
army pants fatigued<br />
at sundown</p>
<p>I want to wander<br />
through your crevices<br />
at the crack of dawn you</p>
<p>acid lemonlime/kiwifruit<br />
regurgitated grass<br />
lamb belly hills</p>
<p>damn you for making<br />
me remember my<br />
military lover</p>
<p>you blanc<br />
you Sauvignon<br />
hills</p>

Note: I wrote &#8220;Hills, Hills&#8221; recently with <em>Shenandoah</em> in mind as I didn’t have anything quintessentially New Zealandish. I wanted to capture a particular color spectrum of green/yellow that occurs here in our harsh antipodean light. The &#8220;military lover&#8221; intruded and sprang from the idea of army fatigue-clad buttocks and wouldn’t go away. Because of this, I jammed all those color words together near the end, by &#8220;happy accident&#8221; or otherwise. The style of pared down, unpunctuated poetry is a departure for me and one that I am happy with. So thanks, <em>Shenandoah</em>!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href='http://shenandoahliterary.org/622/files/2012/11/avalanche.mp3'> Janis Freegard &#8211; Avalanche</a><br />
She was made of rock,<br />
had a massive stride,<br />
a stone ship lurching into dock,<br />
lumbering down the mountainside.</p>
<p>She had a massive stride:<br />
showers of pebbles flew up as she went,<br />
lumbering down the mountainside<br />
on her unstoppable descent.</p>
<p>Showers of pebbles flew up as she went<br />
unseeing – blinded by rage, I thought,<br />
on her unstoppable descent<br />
– or was she just distraught?</p>
<p>That was it, not anger, as I’d thought.<br />
I could see, by the shaking of her shoulders<br />
she was blinded by tears, distraught.<br />
She came to rest by a boulder;</p>
<p>I saw, by the shaking of her shoulders<br />
how easily rock can stumble.<br />
She came to rest by a boulder.<br />
Love leads us all to crumble.</p>
<p>How easily rock can stumble!<br />
And she was made of rock.<br />
Love caused her to crumble,<br />
a stone ship lurching into dock.</p>
