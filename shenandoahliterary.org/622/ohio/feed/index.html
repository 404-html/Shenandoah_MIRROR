					<description><![CDATA[I like the phrase &quot;her costume insistent&quot; because it makes the lover sound as if, in a way, she had already become a ghost. An interesting way to foreshadow her death. And the description of the death itself startled me, jolted me into the sudden surprise of her absence. The last line is perfect, the way it conveys the narrator&#039;s obsession with this lover&#039;s departure and exactly how that feels.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Firstly, I am intrigued and impressed by the two line stanzas, but I can&#039;t understand them or put their meaning into any terms that would make sense. I like how the poem fades in and out, between specifics and feelings, and between a person and a ghost. I also like how two such simple actions-- the asking of the neighbor if Emma had seen her lover, and the ripping up of the note--  were two central, emotional cruxes of the poem. This was my favorites of the ones I&#039;ve read so far.]]></description>
