					<description><![CDATA[I would never want to read this poem aloud. It makes me incredibly uncomfortable! Overall, I feel that this work absolutely illustrates a misogynistic tendency to believe that women must perform in a certain way to please their male sexual partners. At the end of the poem Sugar Magnolia Wilson uses the phrase &quot;for the national good&quot;. I think that with this phrasing she emphasizes the unhealthy vision of sexual expectation that arises from a culture of &quot;hooking up&quot;. Men have idealized visions of women, and in order to please their partners, women must act accordingly. Nevertheless, this poem searches for the meaning behind this crude cultural phenomenon.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This poem is surprising in the way that good poetry should be. I like how it begins with the general, easily imagined party scene, and then funnels into the speaker&#039;s personal account. The progression from stanzas of two lines to three and then back to two mirrors this transition as well. My favorite thing about this poem is the tone, though: I don&#039;t feel as if the speaker is trying to evoke empathy, yet the blunt sarcasm heightens its emotional intensity. The sharp diction and pithy tone coupled with the use of the second person makes it highly uncomfortable without much effort; the poem is simple but striking. It attacks the broader idea of public obsession with sports gods (brutes), but also brings me personally very close to the poem and one shocking, specific moment.]]></description>
