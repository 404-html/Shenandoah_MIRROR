					<description><![CDATA[I think that this is a great poem with a moral teaching. All humans have their weaknesses. We are not invincible. I think that this poem shows me that despite the fact that I would like to think of myself as entirely resolute, in my life, I will encounter people and things that cause me to falter in my convictions and perceived strength. What isn&#039;t included in &quot;Avalanche,&quot; is that after we fall to pieces from weakness or desire, humans all have the strength to mend themselves and persevere despite momentary setbacks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the way the writer has a changing refrain that ties each stanza together by repeating a piece from the previous stanza. It is particularly effective in causing an &quot;avalanche&quot; effect inside the poem: the rhythm rolls steadily faster because of the way each stanza is connected. The way the last line is a throw back to the first stanza causes this rhythm to grind to an abrupt halt, just as a rock falling down a cliff eventually comes to rest at the bottom.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love how the author so deeply personifies the avalanche in this poem. The comparison between an Avalanche and the breaking point of emotion--whether angry or distraught--is very accurate, and the enormous amount of sensory detail she uses communicates both the emotion of the avalanche and the author&#039;s personal emotions very well.]]></description>
