					<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s a lot of good subtlety in this poem. The pace is slow and conversational, yet with a definite underlying sarcasm combined with hopelessness. Small elements work together to augment this complexity, such as the parentheses, or cliched phrase &quot;beautiful new young wife.&quot; line breaks and enjambment of the last line also emphasize the casual but also biting tone. I like the journey from the stillness of the here-and-now to the question in line four where the poem turns...I think that good poems usually don&#039;t know the answer to the questions they ask, and while this question seems sarcastic or rhetorical, I think that the speaker genuinely wonders how the life and customs of men in Roman times haven&#039;t changed. Presumably, Pliny the Younger&#039;s ignorance to the terrifying beauty of the waterfall in his palace (and of his wife) resonates in the speaker&#039;s life as well.]]></description>
