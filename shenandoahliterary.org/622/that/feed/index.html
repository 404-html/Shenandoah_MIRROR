					<description><![CDATA[Sam&#039;s comment about the repetition of &quot;that&quot; and its reflection of the baby&#039;s still heat beat is a really good observation. I am really moved by the idea of the baby&#039;s funeral in this piece. When I consider the funerals I&#039;ve been to, they have all been somewhat comforting in terms of being a &quot;celebration of life.&quot; Of course death can be terribly sad, but being able to recall happy memories of a person&#039;s life can make it easier to manage. In this case, there is nothing to celebrate because the baby never lived a life. The death is tragic in every sense for Julie, as she had to go through the pain of giving birth knowing that she would not be giving birth to a healthy baby.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This poem is an intensely disturbing one, mostly because of the subject matter, but also because of the manner in which the poet conveys the horror of having a miscarriage, especially so close to the due date. The repetition of &quot;that&quot; at the beginning of every line draws acute attention to the poem&#039;s rhythm and thus contrasts it with the broken rhythm of life, the baby&#039;s still heart beat. Particularly unsettling is the thought of the mother having to carry her stillborn baby for another three days and having to go through the pain of giving birth all for nothing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This poem is beautiful and tragic.  The repetition of &quot;that&quot; at the beginning of each line creates an almost rhythmic tone that keeps the poem going, even in the most depressing descriptions of the miscarriage.  This is similar to how the people in the poem must continue on despite the horribly sad moments they must face.  It also suggests injustice, in that Julie must wait for three days after she knows the baby has died, and then give birth in &quot;the usual way&quot; and that the &quot;labor script&quot; remains intact, despite the completely different circumstances from the birth of a live child.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[this poem is disturbing, not only because of the subject matter, but because of the audible resonance of the unfolding tragedy. The repetition of the word &quot;that&quot; at the beginning of every line makes me think of the poem as marching relentlessly. I think the title is perfect not only because it is physically a part of the poem, but because it encompasses all the thoughts and moments into one.]]></description>
