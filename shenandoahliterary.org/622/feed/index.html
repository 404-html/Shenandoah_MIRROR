Always dream about being an archaeologist? <em>The First Human, </em>by Ann Gibbons, is a fascinating expose on the search for human ancestors by real life archaeologists.</p>
<p><em>The First Human</em> maps out archaeologists&#8217; quests to discover the relationship between modern day humans and our ancestors both inside and outside Africa or &#8220;the cradle of humanity.&#8221; It is an intriguing perspective on the ethics and relationships between archaeologists and delves into what it means to be human. While providing accurate information, <em>The First Human </em>is a mesmerizing read for the every day consumer interested in the origins of mankind. It balances the storytelling element of the lives of the archaeologists, such as Meave Leakey, who made the discoveries while teaching the reader about digs and specific discoveries, including the now famous fossil name &#8220;Lucy,&#8221; that shed light on the &#8220;human family&#8221; and &#8220;fossil hunters.&#8221; Kirkus Reviews wrote that it is &#8220;a deft account-part detective story, part adventure tale-of recent breakthroughs in the search for human origins [&#8230;] Gibbons provides inspiring portraits of genius laced with the nitty-gritty of oral foible, all informed by firsthand accounts, interviews and research.&#8221; I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in archaeology.</p>

In this crossover novel, published as Middlegrade, the textured culture, traditions, and history developed by McKinley is so rich and believable it will leave you wanting more. In <em>The Blue Sword, </em>a young woman named Harry moves to her brother&#8217;s posting at an outlying military post upon the death of her father and gets caught between her homeland and a dwindling aboriginal country.  Harry is kidnapped by the desert people where she learns about and falls in love with their culture. Ultimately she must decide between her two worlds and her role in an approaching war. <em>The Blue Sword </em>is a Newberry Honor Book, ALA Notable Children&#8217;s Book, Horn Book Fanfare and an ALA Best Book for Young Adults (<a href="http://blogs.slj.com/practicallyparadise/2011/03/20/top-teen-titles-15-19/">1</a>).</p>
<p>McKinley&#8217;s writing is thoughtful and sharp; the narrative voice is warm and innocent but not naive. Harry develops into a strong female protagonist that makes a place for herself in an unsure world while earning the respect of the more experienced males. She is reminiscent of Sabriel in Garth Nix&#8217;s <em>Abhorsen </em>trilogy with similar attributes to Arya Stark in George R.R. Martin&#8217;s <em>A Song of Ice and Fire </em>series. If you are an adult reader interested in the hype surrounding Crossover Young Adult or Middlegrade fantasy, <em>The Blue Sword </em>is a great way to get your feet wet.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>(Carnegie Mellon, 2013)</em></p>
<p><em>The Fortunate Era</em>, Arthur Smith’s fourth full-length collection of poetry, proves challenging, as many of these poems are unflinching, headlong gazes into death and the concept of what lies behind perception and time, behind realities detectable via the senses and the perfunctory notions how life passes. Reading this book feels much like a pilgrimage that leads to an ablutionary place, a fulfilling yet harrowing journey. These poems are anything but sententious—they are surreal, wise, and deeply mysterious. If they don’t exactly attempt to clarify “the static / The mind makes of death so close / At hand” (“Tracking Down the Music of the Spheres”), they at least acknowledge this dissonance with surprising imagery, musicality, and consistent precision. They are powerfully imaginative and self-possessed.</p>
<p>Indeed, the book fittingly opens with a quotation from Russell Hoban’s remarkable post-apocalyptic novel, <em>Riddley Walker</em>, part of which reads “How cud any 1 not want to get that shyning Power back from time back way back?” Here the protagonist recognizes and laments the destruction of his own world, the emptiness he inhabits now, but there is a trace of pleasure that alloys his pain, for he is granted access, at least a vision, to what was. <em>The Fortunate Era</em> similarly calls on memory to revisit pleasures of the past, but the speakers of these poems almost always leverage these pleasures with blunt recognitions of the unstable present and, in a few cases, a brittle future.  Intoxicating and beautifully strange, these pieces cull meaning from speculative ideas about what’s real or illusive, as in the opening poem “Paradise,” in which the narrator almost casually addresses his experience in and abandonment of a version of heaven:</p>
<p>Mornings, like waking to someone’s scent<br />
You hadn’t yet met and married for life,<br />
Though I didn’t know that then—the night cooled<br />
Muskmelons rolling belly-up to the stars,<br />
And by late afternoon the dusk-colored<br />
Dust of apricots on everything.<br />
From that earth, my body<br />
Assembled itself, and when the veil dropped,<br />
I tried to say what I saw.</p>
<p>The narrator then says that he’s attempted to tell people about this place: “You tell people . . . over and over, / And it’s really crazy, they won’t believe you. / All that sugar coaxed out of clay and you / Can’t even give it away. . . .” Thus the narrator walks away from the excess and this perfect place, the storehouse of memory becomes a panoply of references by which to gauge how one’s life has changed.</p>
<p>In “Sans Soleil,” a bleak and powerfully dystopian vision that begins “Once in the future, in an underground cramped city / Below the frozen one that used to be Toronto, I found / Myself walking through nurseries drizzling / With ferns and banks of pink azaleas,” the narrator quickly whittles these fecund images down to scene in which a mother beats her son, a son much bigger than she, with a wooden-soled shoe. Despite the “dozen vanilla bean pods,” the “bodegas and strawberries,” and a “pet store overrun with parrots,” the kaleidoscopic effect of the poem is stilled and silenced by the spectacle of the “mother’s rage” and the “boy’s acquiescence,” not to mention that the narrator’s own consent: “What can you do? This is the way / The world is going to work. Down here, everything occurs / In the present, now, which happens over and over / Because that’s all we have.”</p>
<p>Consider “What Song Hath the Creatures of the Field”:<br />
Rabbits are aware when they are<br />
About to have their throats slit.<br />
They know when you walk back<br />
To the cage with that in mind.</p>
<p>What a rotten feeling if your heart’s<br />
Not in it. They squeal with a voice<br />
That doesn’t belong to Easter,<br />
But to a small, terrified mammal.</p>
<p>The poem then pivots interestingly into the childhood memory of the speaker’s mother singing as she baked. The narrator comes to terms with the violence of the natural world and with endings, forming a personal eschatology through memories of his origin.</p>
<p>“Valentine” is another remarkable poem that works with the disparity of memory&#8217;s brutality and the trust that memory itself induces transcendence:</p>
<p>Back then, for all I cared,<br />
God could have been a spider<br />
Glossy as a buttercup<br />
Sunning in the garden<br />
Of the first woman<br />
Time gave me to<br />
And then took back.</p>
<p>What I mean is, once, like ice,<br />
Something pierced my heart<br />
With a light<br />
So fierce<br />
It heightened<br />
Every thin-stemmed flower after.</p>
<p>That’s how I think of God now,<br />
Each time—<br />
Going back to her—<br />
That immense and holy cold, an arrow<br />
sinking in.</p>
<p>Not all is gloomy in <em>The Fortunate Era</em>. There are moments of levity, often masterfully intertwined in Smith’s imaginative wordplay, and there are poems, too, that end on genuinely joyful notes, as in “Of All People.” Ideas of diminishment, of feeling sculpted into insignificance embody this poem, and the narrator does not flinch from a haunting morbidity: “The same way my sister languishes / Somewhere in the western desert, / Devoured / by microscopic blue-green plants / Whose fronds make tatters of her lungs / And married her forever to the sands.” However, the narrator recalls his sister’s living joy—and this memory still exists in space-time, as</p>
<p>Somewhere Barry Manilow is blowing her a kiss<br />
From a white limousine flying by us<br />
On a steep grade in the mountains<br />
Between the deserts<br />
Of Reno and South Lake Tahoe.</p>
<p>Thus, the narrator does not give into her death—he subverts it by re-arranging that which ends the vision of one he’s loved and lost.</p>
<p>While leveraged with spare moments of humor, <em>The Fortunate Era</em> is a deeply serious, lucid book, elegiac and transcendent, a collection essential for those craving poems that allow the reader room to imagine beyond the page. There are no easy answers in this book, no mere mood pieces, and while a few of these poems recall the declarative, stark, and undaunted lyrics and narratives of Jack Gilbert, they acknowledge the sorrow born from the recognition of mortality and the loss of those close to the poet in ways this reader has never encountered. This collection’s depth, no matter how stygian at times, creates sources of transcendent and surreal vitality.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(Orchises, 2013) $21.95 Hardback.</p>
<p>Derek Sheffield’s first full-length collection, <em>Through the Second Skin</em>, is the culmination of a complex and brilliant mind drawn to the natural world, a mind just as keen to explore human beings—whether in relation to non-human nature or to themselves. The central beauty of this book lies in the flexibility of Sheffield’s voice: Although motifs, especially birds and ecology, form connective tissues that bind the collection, each poem is so different from the others that the book becomes less a narrative and more a broad ground of textures and spectra, much like the collection’s striking cover: a brilliant, close-up, and vivid shot of the complex venation and color-field of a dappled autumn leaf.  This denial of tonal sameness makes <em>Through the Second Skin</em> particularly fun to read, and worth revisiting to relive the surprises inhabiting Sheffield’s poems.</p>
<p>Sheffield is a naturalist, a devoted bird enthusiast, and “Ornithology 101,” the book’s opening poem, reflects the poet’s facility with image and sound:</p>
<p>Now that you have staked their skeletons,<br />
eyed the scope of a throat, prodded<br />
strutted white ribs, pinched<br />
a wishbone for resilience, thumbed<br />
a keeled sternum’s edge still trying<br />
to steer scattered feathers, stroked<br />
a hummingbird’s mum iridescence, ruffed<br />
the white down of a great egret<br />
slit and stuffed as last year’s final project,<br />
sprinted with a severed wing to catch<br />
the physics, given new vision<br />
to a blackbird with two dabs of cotton,<br />
you can leave with an A in class Aves.</p>
<p>The poem concludes on an expansive note, and the perceptive piercing of the bird and all its being is counterpointed by the poem “Search Engine,” in which Sheffield deftly synthesizes the idea of contemporary technology with the elemental: “Stooped over a desk, fingers / tapping, a man squints // as if he looks into the sun / instead of a screen. Beyond // his wall, branches stir over a lengthening line, ants // on the crawl. With taps / clicks, and whirrs, he ventures // wider. . . .” Indeed, the narrator also includes other forms of nature in his exploration.</p>
<p>Particularly successful are “The Accretions” and “Oystermen.” The former poem proves meditative, satirical, stark, profound. Prompted by a letter from Sheffield’s friend, part of which forms the epigraph—“I understand that Blake would have us see heaven in a grain of sand, but some days nature must bow before the accretions of our fantastic species.”—Sheffield elucidates these accretions:</p>
<p>So that’s what the sun has been up to<br />
prostrating its shining before mine<br />
as I savor the genius of knife and fork<br />
with respect to steak. Every day ending<br />
in a bow, a flattering reminder<br />
to save room for that saffron custard</p>
<p>crème brûlée, that pinnacle<br />
caramelized in Paris as nowhere else.<br />
On the Boulevard of Champions,<br />
bankers dab their lips with cloth napkins,<br />
merci, as the moon lowers herself<br />
before Pepsi and the pyramids. . .</p>
<p>Indicative of his flexibility not only between poems but within them, Sheffield jolts the narrative into an exploration of his past and the violent realities of war.</p>
<p>“Oystermen” recalls the narratives of Wilfred Owen, Heaney, and Hopkins, with its sonic vividness and wordplay: “With slowing eyes, I watch them roam  / and dazzle like prehistoric fireflies, //call out over the blue-green mussel worm / that twists a slimed gleam in the muck, / the severed arm of the six-rayed star, / some kind of eye globbed on a stick.”</p>
<p>The collection is punctuated throughout with celebrations of the avian, including “Living on James Wright,” a meditation on Wright’s aesthetics as well written partially in Wright’s style, particularly the poem’s plangent conclusion. “Aubade” is a certain, delicate, and gentle poem about the love of nature and of a spouse. Alternatively, “Prayer with Game” is a forceful, consonantal poem with a nearly Saxonic hardness.</p>
<p><em>Through the Second Skin</em> contains hues of Roethke, Heaney, Hopkins, James Wright, Frost, and Richard Hugo, but Sheffield never acquiesces to mimicry. His poems invite the reader through a gamut of emotional resonances. These poems are by turns intense, contemplative, celebratory, meditative, genuinely funny, and plaintive. Consequently, this collection reads more like a mid- or late-career book rather than a first full-length, as Sheffield’s voice is not only mature, but confident, strong, delightfully unpredictable, and genuinely remarkable.</p>

Because serious literature invites readers into conversations that extend beyond the fictional framework, teachers have to be willing to walk on thin ice to help students engage uncomfortable ideas and situations with the full force of their imaginations. This includes talking about guns and how they and their owners are presented.  Of the courses I teach, three – Appalachian Literature, The Western Novel and The Civil War in American Literature – involve narratives in which firearms figure heavily.  The weapons are maintained, discussed, brandished and valued.  They are used for hunting, self-defense, feud, crime and battle, and some characters earn approval by their facility with them.  In short, the intellectual and emotional force of the narratives often depends upon gun violence.</p>
<p>To visualize scenes and project themselves with visceral immediacy, my students have to understand how various weapons operate, from the muzzle-loading Springfields in <em>Cold Mountain</em> to Colt revolvers in <em>Hombre</em> and bolt-action deer rifles in Chris Offutt’s Kentucky stories.  These days I frequently find that my students have almost no real-life familiarity with guns, and though it’s comforting that they’re not would-be vigilantes eager to pack Glocks to class, I have to teach them to imagine in detail the use of guns in fiction without seeming to promote the American gun culture which has outlived the frontier era. It’s a challenging exercise, never a comfortable topic to broach, but questions concerning guns serve to remind us all that the worlds of fiction, history and our own daily lives overlap in serious ways.  They’re also, sometimes, painfully personal questions for me, but I do believe that a discussion which contextualizes gun use historically, interrogates gun violence and those who commit it, while refusing to glamorize guns, can be illuminating and life-altering.  For now, the classroom seems a viable forum to conduct our investigations, but I don&#8217;t know that it will remain so.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2.</strong> ONE GUN</span><br />
One brisk day in the early spring of 1968 my friend Felton and I were returning to the UNCC campus from fishing at a friend’s lake cabin.  It had been a good outing, and our spirits were high.  As we rode westward up the sloping street that led to the student union building, we spied two male figures at the crest of the hill.  The pair stood four or five feet apart, one man’s arm outstretched.  He seemed to be pointing a finger at the other’s face, but we both recognized right away that something about their postures and spacing was seriously wrong.  It may be that we guessed simultaneously that a pistol was involved.  About fifty yards away from them, we entered a bend where large rocks briefly blocked our view.</p>
<p>As we rounded the rocks, we heard popping sounds – one or two – and when we could see them again, one man was no longer standing and the other was holding the gun to his own head.  Another shot followed, and then the bodies were sprawled on the pavement.  When we reached them, one was trembling, the other still, his arm outstretched, hand still clinging to a small caliber revolver.  Their contorted, riven faces and the blood pooling around them, the shadow of a tree, the wind suddenly silent – it all formed an unforgettable tableau, almost a tableau from an allegory I could spend a lifetime deciphering.</p>
<p>A woman was running toward the scene from the eastern slope of the road, but she was still thirty or forty yards away.  As Felton removed the gun from the shooter’s hand and tried to communicate with the survivor, I drove downhill to intercept the woman, whom I recognized, and took her to the nursing station, where I called the police and contacted the Dean of Students.</p>
<p>Within the hour, some pieces of the puzzle had fallen into place – a romantic triangle involving two students, both of whom we knew – Buddy H. and Cindy C., who was married to a non-student.  I knew only his last name.  There had been trouble before, and on that April afternoon the husband had come to campus to seek out Buddy, telling the student&#8217;s friends that the two just needed to talk.  I was never sure about the subsequent dialogue and choreography, but this much came to light: Cindy’s husband had brought the gun to campus, had forced Buddy up the hill, and just as we arrived had shot both Buddy and himself in the head.  C. was already dead out there under the stark blue sky, but Buddy H. lived for several hours, unresponsive but sustained by medical technology until the next morning.</p>
<p>Though I have tried to recount this incident dispassionately, even now it chills me to revisit the details.  If it sounds as though Felton and I acted with composure, I’m sure any deliberateness was born of a kind of shock, as I was far from calm once I returned to the scene and was interviewed as a witness.  Fortunately, Felton had already provided a full and fairly coherent narrative, and I had little to add, though I’ve been telling myself the story in many different ways for almost half a century.  It has various outcomes, and I&#8217;m not always just a witness, but no account is satisfying or cathartic.  No literary discussions about the limitations of violence have served to erase that little film loop in my mind, which often comes unbidden, &#8220;triggered,&#8221; as we say, by some subtle association.</p>
<p>As I sat before the TV news – coincidentally in my old friend Felton’s den –  the day after the Sandy Hook School shooting, I could feel my muscles growing increasingly tense as my teeth clenched and ground.  Unsurprisingly, the utterance of “gun” and “campus” in close proximity always gives me a twist in the gut, and it has never been possible to accept the UNCC incident as just another part of my education.  Watching the reporters and others hovering about the scene, I kept picturing that spring day decades ago.  The old images became increasingly vivid, and in the two months since Newtown, they have not subsided.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3.</strong> GUNS I HAVE KNOWN</span><br />
I have vivid recollections of hearing on the radio about the Columbine shootings and of seeing in my e-mail a campus alert during the slaughter at Virginia Tech just two hours away from where I teach.  Those are memories I’d just as soon forget, but because I’m a writer of stories and poems, as well as a teacher, I’ve long felt that I should organize my thoughts and emotions concerning America’s gun culture and lock them down in words.  It’s not easy, but as long as I teach courses with violent content, it’s not optional.</p>
<p>It’s not easy partly because I grew up with guns and learned to think about them and their uses in a rational, disciplined and nuanced way.  My father was in law enforcement throughout his working life and still carries a pistol.  I’ve hunted and shot targets, plinked and sent rodents back to their maker.  I own a handgun (with a six-shot cylinder) for home defense, a .22 caliber Henry target rifle (with a loading tube which, I think, hold about a dozen .22 longs) and some unfunctional antique weapons, one a Civil War-era Springfield.  I’ve owned a Wingmaster pump shotgun, a Marlin thirty-aught-six and a couple of other rifles but sold them when I decided to give up hunting as a pastime.  I’ve also worked in security and worn a pistol on my rounds.  My friend Felton has several guns which see frequent use in the field.  He’s a member of the NRA but a stickler for gun safety, and I have never even entertained the thought that he might be a danger to any innocent bystander.  I imagine he&#8217;d be troubled by Ted Nugent&#8217;s recent aggressive rants, and I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;d be drawn to Quentin Tarantino films.  I’d call Felton a “gun buff,” but also a cautious and prudent man.  The upshot of all this is that there&#8217;s a complex matrix of attitudes towards guns out there.  I’m a gun owner and a believer in second amendment privileges, but I have never believed that civilians need – for sport or personal safety – to own weapons of war.  My friends who own and use firearms, for the most part, agree.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>4.</strong> RESISTING THE CULT</span><br />
I’ve met very few people who believe that guns appropriate for sporting or self-defense purposes should be outlawed (so that “only the outlaws will have guns”), or that the people who want all firearms forbidden form a significant national constituency, so that fear of the domino effect seems to me a transparent scare tactic.  Nor am I swayed by the argument that we should shrink from passing laws just because they will be difficult to enforce.  I do believe that we have entered a new era (though not so suddenly as we might imagine), and that we need to use all the logic and imagination we can muster to address the changing times.  When I look at the major reforms in gun laws that took place in Australia seventeen years ago, I&#8217;m encouraged, and when I see N.R.A. commercials, I wonder what percentage of Americans the N.R.A. actually represents.</p>
<p>To begin with, of course, we need to enforce the laws on the books.  Vigorously.  And to impose severe sentences on convicted violators.  We also need to think shrewdly and radically about how to keep guns and violent personalities away from each other, which will require universal and thorough background checks and should involve weapons safety tests and other measures in hopes of identifying at least some who are too unstable or dishonest to trust with guns.  And no, there are no foolproof procedures; violent people will find a way to arm themselves, but we sure don&#8217;t have to make it easy for them, and a serious, long-term consideration may begin to change the way we use guns and images of guns for entertainment and empowerment.  In the Commonwealth of Virginia over the past decade and a half background checks have kept thousands of unqualified people from buying guns.  Will they find guns anyway?  It&#8217;s likely some will, but it will be more difficult and more expensive than walking into the local gun show with a pocket full of cash.</p>
<p>Beyond that kind of scrutiny, I believe that weapons of war (including assault weapons) fall into the same category as machine guns and other firearms covered in the 1934 National Firearms Act, and that their sale should be forbidden.  I have no idea how to approach the millions of such weapons already in private hands, and I don&#8217;t believe any arguments will phase Wayne LaPierre (who has reversed his own position from a decade ago) and those who pay his salary and direct his rhetoric, but until this issue is addressed, we haven’t completely investigated the problem.  Again, Australia: under PM John Howard the government introduced a buy-back program that eliminated thousands of guns.  Next proposal: high-volume magazines are not necessary for sport or self-defense in any scenario that anyone has cited an actual example of.  Beyond that concealed carry permits should be issued only by law enforcement agencies after rigorous training of applicants, with the gun owners bearing the full expense of the instruction; the quickie internet “training courses” which are now legal should be abolished.  Hands-on training by carefully licensed professionals should be mandatory, as keeping a gun is very different from keeping a weed whacker.</p>
<p>We also have to concentrate on making schools secure environments, and though I’m certain that entryways and surveillance equipment need to be examined, reinforced, thoroughly scrutinized, I suspect that fully trained police officers on campus (perhaps on an unannounced, rotating basis) may be part of the solution in some high-risk locations . . . though I hope not.  As most law enforcement officers (a decisive majority of whom are for much stricter gun laws than we now have) agree, wide-scale arming of teachers is neither a practical solution nor a wise philosophical choice.  And the volunteer posses in Arizona (complete with their surprising rap sheets) now being trained by Steven Seagal (who says he has logged &#8220;millions of hours&#8221; in weapons training) &#8212; worst idea I&#8217;ve heard yet.</p>
<p>Certainly I believe we should create and maintain an assertive and effective mental health program designed to identify and treat problems which are violence-related and those which are not, but there’s no way to identify and prepare for someone living a life of quiet desperation who just hasn’t snapped yet or panicked because he heard an unfamiliar noise in his dark house.  That&#8217;s the group most likely to supply the next surprising assassin.  No one can predict or prevent all scenarios, but raised levels of vigilance and constructing obstacles designed to identify potential felons will help.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> OWNERSHIP AND IDENTITY<br />
But even if a clear majority of Americans agreed with me on these points, it’s hard to find our way to wisdom in this matter due to two seldom-discussed factors central to our understanding of guns.  Few are eager to talk about these aspects, but they are crucial.</p>
<p>First, for a host of people, many of whom are not gun enthusiasts, it is thrilling to shoot a firearm, even more thrilling to shoot something with that gun.  Power, control, the magical extension of our hands, the magnification of our ability to throw something.  I used to love to see cans jump off the fence rail when I squeezed a trigger, to watch those RC bottles pop and shatter, and I found satisfaction (and peer acceptance) from being able to bring down dove, quail and an occasional whitetail.  Perhaps more surprising, family range visits, machine gun socials and hunting vacations are all a part of our culture, and not primarily because we need the meat or believe we’ll be called upon to defend ourselves, but because it’s &#8220;fun.&#8221;  It stimulates our hearts and and pumps our adrenaline, and we are addicted to adrenaline.  As I said, &#8220;thrilling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Violent video games and action movies bristling with mayhem and activating our appetite for fantasy are a part of that fun &#8212; imaginatively, vicariously, but vicarious satisfaction is visceral and emotional and often directs our actions.  Note the fervor of, say, Auburn or UCLA sports fans, many of whom have no &#8220;membership&#8221; status in the university community other than their decision to be fans.  Their &#8220;membership&#8221; is artificial, but their ardor no less for that, their bodies no less stimulated.</p>
<p>Pride of ownership is also an issue with guns and serves as the bridge to factor number two: beyond the thrill, guns are also symbols.  Their compactness and sleek, efficient construction of wood and metal, their necessary portability and their extension of our hands, our reach – these make guns the perfect fetish items, in both the psychological and anthropological senses.  They become signatures of our identity, then sources of them, and no one wants to think of surrendering his or her identity to any government agency.</p>
<p>This extension of our feelings for guns, the elevation of them to symbols beyond the practical – beyond sport or self-defense – is what makes the issue so emotional, and those who favor gun ownership with moderate restrictions and regulations and those who value their second amendment rights to the point that they eclipse other dimensions of our democracy must  sit down together and admit: &#8220;Yes, they’re exciting to shoot; yes, they’re useful as tools, and yes, some of them play the wild card role in our efforts to be safe and fair and free, the most successful experiment in the history of nation-making.&#8221; Not until that happens will we have progress.  And we have to enter such negotiations with the understanding that, though few specific scenarios can be prevented with restrictions and background checks, the atmosphere which fosters gun violence can be altered with a multi-faceted, honest and rigorous approach.  If we don&#8217;t find some middle ground, the cult of the gun (the thrill, the fun, the empowerment, Heston&#8217;s &#8220;not-till-they-pry-it-from-my-cold-dead-hands&#8221; zeal) will more and more thoroughly define our culture.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">* POST SCRIPT</span><br />
I confess that the events of the past few years have almost eliminated any notion that I would now find pleasure in shooting my guns, and the last few months have underscored that new perspective.  I keep them clean but don&#8217;t practice.  If there&#8217;s a varmint that needs relocation, I&#8217;ll abstain from the lethal and do the best I can with an air rifle, though still a little ambivalent about that.  As the song says, “The thrill is gone,” but I do still believe in responsible teaching of works in which gun violence features prominently.  For now, I won’t shy away from <em>All Quiet on the Western Front</em> or <em>Lonesome Dove</em>, <em>Flags in the Dust</em> or “A Good Man Is Hard to Find,” but I think it’s important to begin such discussions by addressing the relation of weapons ownership and use to the context of the works, the societies dramatized on the page.  The Saxons had a saying: “Hope for the best, but don’t leave the house without your spear.”  In the late nineteenth century American West people said that, while Abe Lincoln had made all men free, Samuel Colt had made them equal.  Historically, their perspectives are understandable, but if these axioms must still govern us today, perhaps that means we’ve lost control of this democratic enterprise in matters far more fundamental than questions of whether or not a civilian should be allowed to own a weapon of war or buy one <em>sub rosa</em> at a gun show or carry a hidden revolver into a bar, a church, a college campus.  We’re already seeing signs that the ice we stand on is cracking, and we can&#8217;t stand still but must tread softly but decisively, if we&#8217;re to prevent our future from being very cold.</p>

Lord, end this weather, fix the tractor,</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having never cracked the cover of a Harry Potter novel, I opened <em>The Casual Vacancy</em> with no preconceived notions about J. K. Rowling’s writing.  The book, at just over 500 pages, seemed satisfyingly hefty for leisure reading, and small-town England is a topic to which I’m easily drawn.  The story centers on the various rivalries that surface after the “casual vacancy” caused by the sudden death of one of the town leaders, and the social satire is pleasantly biting without being vicious.  The cast of characters, however, makes getting through to the ironies an arduous task.</p>
<p>Rowling writes engaging dialogue, and she knows how to render different voices and accents believably.  She also presents an attractively diverse cast of characters, from neglected toddlers to pimply teenagers to massively overweight, pampered adults.  She seems, however, to have picked up a couple of bad habits from Hilary Mantel.  First, one of the characters refers to the Indian doctor, Parminder Jawanda, as “Bends-Your-Ear,” and, second, Rowling feels the need now and then to clarify pronouns by adding the proper name after it.  Happily, she indulges in neither of these habits as often as Mantel and most Americans will likely enjoy listening to the conversations in the novel.</p>
<p>Both dialogue and narration tend to be literal and fast-paced.  Rowling does not linger too long on metaphors or other figures of speech, which is somewhat surprising in a novel of this length.  When metaphors do occur, they’re usually quite good, as when Krystal Weedon thinks of her past as “her pre-life, which was doused in blood, fury, and darkness.”  They don’t appear often, however, so readers who seek a dense, poetic prose should look elsewhere.</p>
<p>Despite the page by page speed this literal diction creates, the book moves slowly along, primarily because of the number of characters.  This is the real problem with <em>The Casual Vacancy</em>:  remembering who knows/is married to/goes to school with whom.  The character who really stands out is the teenager Krystal Weedon, whose tragedy takes over the more quotidian problems over which the other characters obsess, and the novel might more profitably have made the political squabbling occur among a smaller number of characters.  Each conflict is interesting and revealing, in and of itself, but there are simply too many to keep straight.</p>
<p>If you have the time to devote to sorting out what seem like dozens of characters and want to immerse yourself in a long satire on small-town life, then <em>The Casual Vacancy</em> is for you.  Be warned:  don’t lay it aside for too long or you will forget what is happening to whom.  You will likely also lose track of who is related to whom.  If, however, you want to wade into this backbiting, bickering world, you will emerge with enough information about current affairs in England to last you at least until the BBC film is released.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What possessed the U.S. War Department to order a thousand Austrian-style nine-foot lances of Norway fir, complete with foot-long blades and scarlet swallow-tail pennons, for Rush’s 6th Cavalry Regiment to brandish against artillery and barricaded soldiers armed with large-bore (and sometimes repeating) weapons?  What were Quaker guns or horological torpedoes?  Which army did the most scalping?  How could spectators at a battle be unable to detect gunfire heard in cities miles away?  Who kept pet badgers in camp?  How many mules and horses were killed in the war?</p>
<p>Webb Garrison is not always able to supply answers to these and other questions he raises.  For instance, modern acoustic studies have still not provided a persuasive explanation for the silence that made some battles seem pantomimes.  But Quaker Cannon were logs trimmed and painted to make a fortification (or a ship) appear formidably armed.  In readable and precise prose, the author supplies copious answers to questions most readers have not thought to ask, all in the service of demonstrating that textbooks often obscure the many dimensions of war.  <em>Civil War Curiosities</em>, published twenty years ago, is a book history hobbyists (a group I belong to) still savor.  Divided into twenty-seven chapters, it musters information concerning weaponry, personalities, prison life, political squabbles, costumery and events which would often be dismissed from a work of fiction as preposterous.</p>
<p>Ironies abound, probabilities are overthrown, the progress of events kinks, skids, reverses, while cause and effect “doe-see-doe” like a Barnum production.  Burial services are conducted for men not dead, bodies are moved about the field and stored in ice houses, Edwin Booth saves Robert Todd Lincoln from a moving train, four brothers are killed, one after another, riding the same horse.  An engineer designs a submarine boat propelled by oars, Even without the word “fragging,” soldiers on both sides did it to unpopular and reckless officers.  The New York Times assured readers that the “local commotion” in the South could be put to rest “effectually in thirty days.”  A Confederate soldier wrote in his journal that he’d seen enough of war and hoped that Grant could en it soon.  As late as 1864, there was a rush to buy Confederate bonds, as many Northerners were suspicious of Federal “government paper.”</p>
<p>In short, the world was out of joint even then, and our safe and privileged view allows us to see purported comedies as tragedies, and the reverse.  As Ken Burns demonstrated and Spielberg’s Lincoln has recently reminded us, actions of great pitch and moment are often fraught with petty scrimmages, even the fiercest rivalries and most passionate coalitions characterized by bizarre sidebars and undercurrents.</p>
<p>Among my favorite chapters are those dealing with animals and “No One Called Lincoln Handsome.”  How fast could a horse run for how long?  How many horses does it take to pull a steam overland from Harpers Ferry to Manassas Gap?  Ulysses Grant was widely seen as a slovenly tippler who had done poorly at West Point and in civilian life but had a knack for winning battles; one fact long neglected is that he excelled at horsemanship at the academy and always sat a horse with composure and command.  Confederate General James R, Chalmers, on the other hand, had at least twenty-seven horses shot out from under him.  Belle Boyd rode Fleeter, John MacArthur rode Boomerang, Jeb Stuart rode Highfly, Phil Sheridan rode Aldebaron, General George Thomas’s Billy was named for Sherman, who favored Lexington or Dolly, and one of Grant’s mounts bore the name of Jeff Davis.</p>
<p>That Lincoln was both reviled and revered by those he governed is evident to anyone who’s been keeping up with the books, films and PBS specials commemorating the 150th anniversary of the American Civil War, but the same details tend to rise to the top in these productions.  Garrison offers a surprising sampler of less common quotations and anecdotes.  That his detractors often saw Lincoln as an ape is now no secret, but it may be surprising that one of his law partners described his walk as follows:</p>
<p>“He had no spring to his walk; H[sic]e walked undulatory, up and down in motion.  The very first opinion that a stranger would form of Lincoln’s walk and motion was that he was a tricky man, a man of cunning, a dangerous shrewd man, one to watch closely and not to be trusted.”</p>
<p>A week before his assassination, an officer at Harrison’s Landing said he seemed to have “a sad face – a clown face,” and biographer Carl Sandburg (who had only photos and paintings to go by) wrote that he seemed “like an original plan for an extra-long horse or a lean and tawny buffalo,” and yet there were others who found his aspect noble, tragic, stoic, and those who saw in him a Biblical prophet.</p>
<p>What do all these snips and bits add up to beyond scattered fragments of fact concerning a long ago conflict?  At the least, they remind us of the fine print of war, its impact upon every facet of life for both combatants and civilians, perhaps reminding us that today we are not permeated with the shadows of war, but somewhat insulated from the violent swerve war imposes on simple matters, while our soldiers wage our battles in Afghanistan and on other foreign soil.  At best, they serve to remind us of the unpredictability of events, eccentricities of interpretation, how difficult it is to really remember the errors of the past in their particulars, to imagine them fiercely and clearly enough to help prevent us from repeating them.</p>
<p>WORTH NOTING: Stephen Berry’s <em>Weirding the War: Stories from the Civil War’s Ragged Edges</em> (Georgia, 2011) is a similar book with more concentrated foci.  The essays in the book, written by people who are decidedly not hobby historians, include a discussion of how antebellum ring tournaments contributed to the origins of the KKK, “The Pleasures of Civil War Ruins,” atrocity stories, soldiers’ language, “Confederate Amputees and the Women Who Loved (or Tried to Love) Them,” and three essays under the section head “Hell’s Belles: New Looks at Civil War Women.”  It’s a more systematic and challenging read, rewarding in a different and less anecdotal way.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>reviewed by R. T. Smith</p>
<p>Although I’m not a trained historian, I’m often as interested in the methods of that discipline as I am its findings, and Susan Kerns’ explorations of Shadwell have tapped into that interest.  Less familiar than Monticello, the Shadwell plantation on the banks of the Rivanna River is a crucial site for the understanding of Thomas Jefferson’s circumstances and the role they play in his formation.  In <em>The Jeffersons at Shadwell</em> (Yale), Kerns has produced a readable, intriguing and provocative account of the lives of both privileged masters and slaves in Virginia during the first half of the eighteenth century.  Many will be drawn to the volume’s revelations concerning slave-holding, and Kerns offers many insights and questions concerning this topic.  Two other engaging and frequently overlooked considerations, however, underlie her investigations and sustain my attention: what was Thomas Jefferson’s relationship with his mother, and how accurate is the conventional portrayal of Jefferson as an omnivorous autodidact who arose from a yeoman father and blue-blooded mother to become the luminary of his time like a sturdy but unremarkable tree suddenly blazing from a lightning strike.  In fact &#8212; not to deny his great gifts &#8212; he was raised as an aristocrat to be exactly what he became.</p>
<p>Many historians have suggested that Jefferson’s mother was difficult and stubborn and that his relationship with her was strained, suggested by his burning of his letters to her.  Kerns argues that the opposite was true, and that physical and textual evidence testifies to the value he placed on family privacy and his statements that he found communication about those he loved most to be more difficult as he grew older.  He burned the letters because they were not for other eyes.</p>
<p>Kerns pieces together the documentary and archeological evidence to conjure the daily life and goals of the Jeffersons in their time at Shadwell like an expert physical anthropologist reconstructing an ancient kylix from the shapes and ornamentation of a handful of sherds.  Working from the foundation of the house, which burned in 1770 (&#8220;making the recovery of his formative years an exercise in guesswork,&#8221; according to Joseph E. Ellis), then from the distribution of artifacts and outbuilding remnants, Kerns amplifies the written evidence concerning Peter and Jane Jefferson, their mission and motives, their methods, protocols and influences.  How Shadwell worked as a farm, as a model of culture and taste, as a training ground for the next generation – all these are woven into commentary about the material and social world of the time.</p>
<p>Some scholars have been vigorous in their construction of Peter Jefferson – and to some extent his son – as the yeoman type whose lack of a grand manor house and activity as surveyor and lawyer identify their means as modest, but Kerns reveals in a thorough but graceful prose how a central Palladian structure was not necessary for extensive quarters and belongings.  Nor did the Jeffersons migrate west from the Tidewater region to flee the constraints of Euro-centric society.  They planned and administered Shadwell, as she says “to replicate culture and expand empire,” not to escape it.  In casting himself as a modest farmer not dominated by tobacco culture, Jefferson sought to distance himself from the substantial slave labor required by tobacco cultivation.  By this and truth, Kerns musters convincing evidence that Jefferson was as much engaged in the crafting of his family identity, and his own, as in recording it.</p>
<p>That the Jeffersons owned half a dozen different kinds of hoes, Batavian porcelain, walnut chairs, apothecary supplies and stemmed wineglasses may not draw a general reader’s interest as quickly as information about slave deployment and assignments, sales and punishment, but the artifacts, inventories and accounts reveal the material culture and provide substantial evidence for constructing the daily practices of Shadwell’s owners and chattel.</p>
<p>No doubt Kerns’ thoroughness and imagination will influence Jefferson scholarship, but for the amateur, the book is filled with intriguing information and descriptions that humanize its subjects, detailing how life (including everything from dress, tips from visitors, recreation and access to implements and foodstuff) for a house quarter slave would be different from the experiences of a field hand.  This book reveals the complexity of relationships between house servants and the Jeffersons beyond common knowledge.  For instance, when Peter Jefferson died, his bequest to Thomas included his manservant Sawney, who knew all the signs and permutations of gentlemanship.  Due to Sawney’s role in teaching young Thomas the extent and methods of ownership and society, Thomas became, in some respects, “Sawney’s ward as well as his master.”  How Jefferson children came by design to own child slaves of their gender and approximate age is another of the book&#8217;s eye-openers.</p>
<p>Because the most common popular question about Jefferson concerns his willingness to keep slaves while championing ideas of freedom and equality, Kerns never lets this issue quite fade from consideration.  Although he could scarcely imagine his own life and community different from how it was, Jefferson could still conceive of and desire a whole culture incompatible with his own actual existence.  This great enigma comes to life in surprising ways as Kerns explores the fashion in which white and black members of the community were woven together at Shadwell, though the owner-chattel relationship is always in evidence.</p>
<p>I recommend reading this book as a supplement to a Jefferson biography (maybe Ellis&#8217;s <em>American Sphinx</em> would do the trick), as Kerns doesn’t intend her work as a primer of the fifth president and assumes reader familiarity with many of the details of Jefferson’s public life.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/622/files/2013/02/wonderful.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-851" alt="wonderful" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/622/files/2013/02/wonderful.jpeg" width="166" height="240" /></a>Many readers and reviewers have embraced Goolrick’s novel for, I believe, its unashamed romanticism, the unwavering through-line of its plot and the enthusiasm of its lyrical interludes, such as, “The river water, the sweet Maury, so fresh and clear, still leaping greenly, the water that flows from the eye of Jesus into the heart of God.”  My response to the book was disappointment, tinged with irritation, because I saw a more fiery and instructive story beneath the smoke of his prose.</p>
<p>The narrative follows the oldest and most reliable path: a stranger (Charlie Beale, an artful butcher) comes to town, shyly insinuates himself into its affections, attains heroic stature, deploys his mysterious riches in generous fashion, then pursues an outlaw passion which both reader and townspeople can see is in obedience to a higher law.  But the object of his affections is married, and earthly rules apply, so she is forced to betray him.  The town turns its back, and he suffers with some stoicism until his passion bursts forth again, this time in savage fashion.  And Ishmael alone is left to tell the tale.</p>
<p>Ishmael – actually Will Haislett – is the one real complication in the story, as he’s a small and innocent boy who becomes not only Charlie’s companion but his co-conspirator.  Why the reader is supposed to 1) believe in the extremity of the bond, 2) be untroubled by its dimensions from the start, 3) continue to sympathize with the benign but negligent parents and 4) feel any resonant tension upon the confirmation at the end that Will has been the teller of the story all along, well, this is a mystery to me.</p>
<p>But a less intricate and more peculiar mystery surrounds the suitcase full of cash with which Charlie buys up huge parcels of land and houses and whatever is needed by anyone he befriends.  From the very outset, the reader wonders where the money came from and who’s going to steal it.  It really seems to come from necessity – it allows Charlie to spend bundles on his beloved star-struck “hillbilly” – might as well say it – Sylvan Glass, but it’s never in jeopardy.  Like the appealing moral calculations Charlie makes in his journal, it quickly ceases to be an object of consideration, just as the journal writing stops once the passionate but completely conventional love story gets rolling.</p>
<p><em>Heading Out to Wonderful</em> features a series of predictably attractive attitudes and devices – race-blind principals, a smart and crafty African American seamstress, hypocritical churchgoers and ministers, baseball, a faithful dog, a sleepy town awakened and then shocked by the operation of operatic emotions.  It’s Southern and Appalachian location adds some color, but not much culture (though songs and hymns are skillfully interwoven into the tale, and even Doc Watson is mentioned).  There’s not much work, aside from Charlie’s butchering and some carpentry, and most of the citizens of Brownsburg seem created only as quaint spectators who just go to the green room when they’re not employed as walk-ons.</p>
<p>The lingering question about this novel is whether readers are meant to be coerced by Charlie and Sylvan’s reckless coercion of the boy, who is made to share secrets too weighty for his years.  But this strange triangle is the source of the novel’s shock – the sin, betrayal and bloody revenge, plus the collateral damage.  If it’s fair to say that a writer should lead the reader to be curious about the protagonist, then to care for him, then to be concerned and even worried for him, I think this one fails, partly because Charlie’s mind is not very intriguing and partly because I’m too worried about Will in a knee-jerk way almost from the beginning, and though the story is about Charlie’s actions, the vulnerable Will is somehow the center of it.  But what of Ishmael and Nick Carraway, narrators who are spectators to the grand action but still the riveting psychological focus of their narratives?  From the opening sentences, that pair’s perspective and language become prominent, but Will is just a special and confused little boy who does not tell nor, until years later, understand the story which is the storm that tosses him.</p>
<p>Although seeking the connection between an author’s stated process and his text is at best speculative and often futile, in this case, it may be fruitful.  Goolrick has repeated in interviews that the novel’s plot and characters are based on a true story he heard, the most fascinating story ever, and that he’s repeated it often.  As I read, I could not escape the feeling that he had the events locked in his mind before he created characters to act them out.  Those denizens of Brownsburg move the plot, accomplish the tasks, fulfill the sequence, but they seem to be almost ruthlessly simplified constructs, formed with only the components necessary for the big movements of the book: shy but beneficent stranger’s arrival, his revival of a town, his heroism, his fall from grace due to ungovernable passion, his despair, his unthinkable violence, the sad aftermath.*</p>
<p>I’m not convinced that, even without allowing the characters to grow as complex thinking people, <em>Heading Out to Wonderful</em> couldn’t have been an artful and powerful story, but its unnuanced sequence of events and two-dimensional principles are readymade for a novella, one which would lack the redundancy and feature understatement instead of gushing emotional prose.  If the characters and actions are to be simple, the language needs more governed ingenuity, allowing Goolrick’s moments of sharp and surprising psychological disclosure and imagery to carry the story.  He needs to trust more in the visceral and rhythmic aspects of his imagination – “The house smelled like bacon fat and laundry detergent and bacon fat.  The people smelled like bacon fat and pig sweat and sweat,” – and less on the hasty and lazy impulses that result in, “Charlie’s brother appeared out of nowhere,” or, “You remember a little thing clear as a bell.”</p>
<p>Most of all, Goolrick might consider trusting his sense of the tragic, which often serves him well, and avoiding, both in plot and language – “he spoke of blood, the bond of blood, and he spoke of the dirt and the animals, and the beating heart, the beating heart, the beating heart of brothers” – the melodramatic, which is the snake in the garden.</p>
