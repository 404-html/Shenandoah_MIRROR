					<description><![CDATA[I found this poem oddly underwhelming. It seemed to me as if it were building to something sinister, and at first I expected we would discover the &quot;angular body&quot; was actually dead, or perhaps dying. Instead, it&#039;s a rather every-day poem about the experience of waking up with a part of your body &quot;asleep&quot; from lack of circulation. I do find it interesting the poet constantly refers to whether or not he can remember certain things as he shifts from sleep to wakefullness. He writes that he can barely remember the bird that woke him up, and as the person he&#039;s sleeping next to drifts back to sleep, he writes that he can no longer really remember him/her. It&#039;s interesting that he seems so incapable of remembering things without constant &quot;proof&quot; that they exist.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I find it interesting that this poem was &quot;born&quot; in a place that was once called &quot;the city of action,&quot; as the poem is largely concerned with inaction. However, the author paints a beautiful picture of inaction, a hiatus from the &quot;slow code&quot; that taps at their wall. This poem perfectly communicates the value of silence in a place that is anything but.]]></description>
