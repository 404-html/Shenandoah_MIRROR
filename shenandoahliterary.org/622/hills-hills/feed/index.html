					<description><![CDATA[I really like the limited amount of words in this poem. I think that the work&#039;s simplicity allows for a great deal of personal imagination to influence a reading. When I look at this poem, I immediately am transported to the beautiful, and serene countryside of New Zealand, happily sipping a chilled glass of Sauvignon Blanc!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This poem is so slow and striking and mournful, in a good way. It is narrative, but simple, and powerful. I like the unique combination of military and romance diction, as well as the physical imagery used to describe the hills. I particularly love the lines &quot;acid lemonlime/kiwifruit /regurgitated grass.&quot; The slash emphasizes the speakers anger, like color, and love, like the fruit; and &quot;regurgitated grass&quot; evokes feelings of loss and messiness that she feels from her relationship. Broadly, I appreciate this poem&#039;s capturing of the idea that when humans are distraught, we can usually find a way to make even the most beautiful things resonate with and relate to our unhappiness. Going off of that, my favorite part of this poem is the end, both with the image &quot;sauvignon hills,&quot; and the apostrophe to the hills, as though they are responsible for the speaker&#039;s anguish.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I particularly loved Natasha Dennerstein&#039;s audio clip of &quot;The Hills.&quot; The way that she emphasized each word and line break enhanced the imagery of the poem. Her diction used to describe the grass, the hills, and their nooks was surprising and refreshing. It made each image stand out. Her lack of punctuation was particularly powerful when coupled with the rolling hills of New Zealand.]]></description>
