					<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed reading this poem. One section that particularly interests me is the couple of lines &quot;You do not deserve to be unhappily/ killed but you trust your paddles rather than our promises.&quot; This is a really powerful lines that speaks to the way the New Zealand people may feel about those who are not native to their land. It is interesting where the author chooses to break the stanza in between &quot;unhappily&quot; and &quot;killed.&quot; As a whole, the New Zealand poetry seems to have extremely strong ties with the landscape, which is very much apparent in this particular poem as well.]]></description>
