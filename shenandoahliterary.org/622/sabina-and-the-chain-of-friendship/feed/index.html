					<description><![CDATA[When I first read the poem I found the hen imagery to be startling and somewhat off-puting.  However, I think it is adds a unique and effective layer of complexity to the poem.  The syntax and structure of the lines also relates to the nature of &quot;gossip.&quot;  The lines appear to run on and sound conversational.  This concept of loyalty also seems fragile, personal, and sacred.  Just as the &quot;glass&quot; imagery suggests, it is easily shattered.  The final lines, &quot;The dream that you are walking over glass/to reach the other man/You don’t tell that to anyone,&quot; reinforce that fragility.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One of the many things I like about this poem is the way it is both about a chain and, as the line lengths grow and shorten, it looks like a chain. It even sounds like a chain: some lines are enjambed while others are end-stopped, giving this poem a chatty tone that correlates to the theme of women gossiping, and to the image of hens pecking. I also appreciate how it articulates the implied social structure that goes along with this gossip, but the poem also has a surprising twist at the end with the implication that actual disloyalty or genuinely gossip-worthy material should be kept silent.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Like Chris mentioned, the hen imagery is effective. I associated squaking chickens with gossip, so to me it is logical, yet also refreshing. I could very much relate to the &quot;down the chain&quot; concept that is presented here. I found the diction to be charmingly simple and treatment of the subject insightful. The dark turn at the end provided a surprising, powerful close.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The hen imagery is strangely appropriate for the poem. I like the concept of the friendship chain, or that it is ok to gossip/complain based upon status or value - it is probably true, but most people do not realize it unconsciously happens.]]></description>
