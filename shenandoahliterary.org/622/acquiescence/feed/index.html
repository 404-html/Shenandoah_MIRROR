					<description><![CDATA[This story is beautifully written and contains such depth of emotion in so few sentences.  One thing that I loved is the almost disjointed way in which the widow views everything from the day of her husband&#039;s funeral.  She flits from being on a plane, to being at the funeral, to suddenly returning to the airport; it is as if she cannot focus too long on one aspect of the day.  I know that I often feel that it is easier to not think than to accept a loss and succumb to the grief that follows.  This piece truly captures the essence of a widow&#039;s grief but through a less obvious expression.]]></description>
