					<description><![CDATA[I really liked the way this poem contrasted adult vs. childish reactions to unpleasant realities. It seemed to be commenting on the freedom a child has in expressing itself in contrast to its mother or any adult. And in the second stanza, when the child nuzzles into its mother&#039;s neck, we also see the poem examining the different ways in which children and adults cope with these problems after their inital reactions. Children typically turn to their parents to comfort them, but often adults are left to deal with these things on their own.]]></description>
