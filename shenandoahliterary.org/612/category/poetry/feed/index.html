<p>Between the weeping cherry<br /> and the porch, the argiope<br /> floats head down at the center<br /> of an enviable patience.</p>
<p>Her egg sac—little ochre<br /> marble, little kindergarten sun—</p>
<p>pasted to the rail: another<br /> Pandora’s hope at the bottom of the box<br /> one more artist won’t live to see.</p>
<p>The cherry cannot hold her<br /> even with that weeping<br /> any more than it can hold its pinks,<br /> or October its fool’s gold.</p>
<p>One September night<br /> she will dismantle all her silks<br /> and disappear.</p>
<p> *  *</p>
<p>In here, on the desk,<br /> an old photograph—</p>
<p>cousins, five of us, frozen<br /> in the slanted sun<br /> of our last free summer.</p>
<p>How patient we are<br /> squinting for decades<br /> and grinning into the camera<br /> because we were good<br /> and were told</p>
<p>except for the one<br /> in her new kindergarten dress<br /> with the white collar, the one<br /> caught in a worried look</p>
<p>as if she were already<br /> staring out this window,<br /> watching the unthinkable going on.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The night after the service, his sister appears<br />
to him.  She is gathering her paintings<br />
for the show her gallery promised: seascapes<br />
like bowls of broth, moons like Camembert<br />
wheels, chunked off and eaten.  Her life’s work!<br />
She asks his opinion of this one, that one.<br />
She says, “Nobody calls me.”<br />
He says, “How can they?  You’re dead.”<br />
She shakes her head: No.</p>
<p>The next night he sees her adding the last<br />
brushstrokes to  green grapes<br />
lounging on a white platter.<br />
They walk among the paintings,<br />
each with its title and price.<br />
She says, “Nobody answers my calls.”<br />
He says, “They can’t hear you.<br />
No breath, no heartbeat, No coming back.”<br />
She shakes her head: No.</p>
<p>The third night she stands at the foot of his bed<br />
pleading.  She begs him to take the paintings.<br />
Maybe he will have better luck.<br />
Her death? They don’t speak  of it.<br />
She says, “Take the days as they come,<br />
the nights as they go.  Don’t forget me.”<br />
He says, “How much of yourself you left behind!”<br />
She says, “Look for me in the world I left<br />
when the sun splashes its light on everything.&#8221;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8211;translated from the English of John Keats</p>
<p>No, you won’t take those easy ways to forget<br />
yew-berries, wolf-bane, nightshade, death-watch beetle,<br />
or death moth.  They could lead to what you thought<br />
was your body’s inevitable goal of darkness.<br />
My holy self-mate, your soul isn’t an owl<br />
and will never come to know what an owl knows,<br />
yet why should you and I be put to sleep<br />
without an owl’s wide-eyed and wholly secret<br />
understanding of the night?  If you should feel<br />
suddenly melancholy as a storm cloud,<br />
remember the rain you shed will bend the flowers<br />
only a moment, then turn the hillside as green<br />
as a mock shroud.  This very morning it fed<br />
the roses and peonies, covered the ocean<br />
and the barren desert with unlikely rainbows,<br />
so when your mistress (your mysterious mistress)<br />
is bitter again, hold her hand and gaze<br />
into her incomparable eyes<br />
and wait with her once more till you remember<br />
she <em>lives</em> in melancholy.  She doesn’t believe<br />
she’s beautiful.  She thinks she <em>was</em> beautiful<br />
once upon a time and was only happy<br />
long ago, then felt her pleasure sting<br />
and disappear, and feels she must die now.<br />
Look deeply enough. Will she recall bursting<br />
with joy on your tongue like grapes, how her body<br />
(now Melancholy’s shrine) remains a temple<br />
of delight where the gods have hung their grapes forever?<br />
Now she sees nothing but their clouded bloom.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This extraordinarily self-centered<br />
form on the outside seems<br />
modest enough:  a brown, dry, thin,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; easily broken, vulnerable coat<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; which is nevertheless as good<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as tree bark at protecting<br />
and preserving what’s going on<br />
(and on) inside.  If you hold it<br />
and, with a knife, begin<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; scraping away, you discover<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a pale, firm handful still bearing<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; scars on its opposing<br />
seamless hemispheres<br />
where the roots and stalks<br />
fulfilled their promises,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;then disappeared.  If you cut now<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and peel and keep taking away<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;layers and unpredictable fragments<br />
of layers that may be turning<br />
inside out, retesting the terms<br />
of solid geometry,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if you keep on peeling past<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;where a thrifty cook would have stopped,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;you’ll find an untouched, almost<br />
untouchable whiteness more certain<br />
of itself and its meaning than what lies<br />
under these very words, a slippery<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;pearl easily mishandled<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and no more tasteful than the debris<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;surrounding it (thanks to you)<br />
on the chopping block, and you’re left<br />
with only a metaphoric<br />
whiff of an exit line.</p>

<p>When they found Emeline, a nail<br />
held her sack dress together</p>
<p>at the neck.  She lived by gathering herbs<br />
to sell for curing leather from the land</p>
<p>her people held since they took it from the Cherokee,<br />
quilted mountainsides in Appalachia</p>
<p>where they hewed walnut into rocking chairs,<br />
and sang the stony country’s <em>blessings be,</em></p>
<p>and ballads carried in their ears from Scotland.<br />
From my grandmother, her granddaughter,</p>
<p>I have one word in her dialect: <em>stime.</em><br />
Long-ah, half-rhyme with steam, its meaning: <em>not enough.</em></p>
<p>As, <em>there’s</em> <em>nary stime of tea nor sugar nar. </em><br />
In iron light, in that mountain graveyard</p>
<p>her clan’s settler stones grow up with moss<br />
thick as the harmonies in shape note tune.</p>
<p>In the woods, a shadowy foundation:<br />
They took apart her house to save the boards.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This compass-headed bird,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dead-reckoning South in Fall,<br />
arcing its bloody breast<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;above the roof and cawing<br />
some kind of bold farewell<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to higher air and leaderless<br />
V’d fliers off on it,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;was shot (we saw and heard),<br />
and staggered in the sky,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;dripping blood and guts<br />
down on the lobstered roofers<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;working in the sun.<br />
It sang its downfall swan<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;song silently, now, spread<br />
its wings, and then, as silent<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;as its eyes, it lay<br />
resting on the roof,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;face up, and looked at clouds,<br />
(and some sweet heaven we<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;could almost see); but soon<br />
pain shook it like an angry<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;nurse, so one good roofer<br />
struck head from body with<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a spade, merciful severance,<br />
and catwalked off, bloody<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;spade dragging on the tiles,<br />
a man of dirty duty,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;unlike the murderer<br />
of song, the wanton boy-<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;in-man, who pellet-shot<br />
the bird (the shot we heard);<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and this once musical,<br />
most bright and beautiful,<br />

<p>Late night, late love, and at the window, rain,<br />
And then the aftermath of love and rain,<br />
The wakefulness beside a kitchen window,<br />
The whole house quiet as the soul of darkness</p>
<p>Except for the sounds of two clocks ticking,<br />
Or one blind clock on the cloud-lit wall<br />
And another going <em>tock tock</em> in the downspout.<br />
The rain could spill from the leaves for an hour.</p>
<p>I stand in darkness at the bedroom door<br />
And catch your feathered breathing, slow and pure,<br />
Easy as a heartbeat or the summer rain,<br />
Then wander back for a glass of water</p>
<p>And only the slow <em>tock tock </em>of the rain<br />
To tell me I am breathing in my time again.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After reaching down and delivering<br />
spring’s terminal clusters,<br />
a whiteness mixing citrus and jasmine<br />
whenever we opened the back door,</p>
<p>our mock-orange bushes<br />
have let fall their thumbnail<br />
blossoms, leaving seed capsules<br />
in their pale green starbursts.</p>
<p>A display of inherences ourselves,<br />
we find common ground.<br />
Back inside we’ll check each other<br />
for ticks, those obsidian jots</p>
<p>that the exhalations of a host<br />
alert to spring from leaf tips.<br />
But now our pruning shears<br />
reach the leafless, the long ago</p>
<p>flowered-out.  Their absence<br />
a promise.  Is any other<br />
desire at all like this?<br />
A fragrance running us to earth.</p>

born a hundred years before me<br />
in a time when it was expected that a woman<br />
would pore only over <em>Godey&#8217;s Lady&#8217;s Book</em>,<br />
<em>I know you will pardon my long silence, </em><br />
<em>when you learn the important fact that I am at housekeeping, </em><br />
or receipts clipped from newspapers,<br />
<em>add butter the size of a walnut.</em><br />
Housekeeping as holy writ, butter as The Way.</p>
<p>His twenty years of writing sermons.<br />
His wife, in the kitchen<br />
creaming butter and sugar by hand<br />
with a green-handled wire whip, blue bowl<br />
tucked firmly against her side.<br />
The inkspill.<br />
What caused it?  Epiphany or distraction?<br />
<em>The Man called Jesus, </em>or a scarlet<br />
cardinal flown to the boxelder just outside<br />
the study window singing, <em>what cheer-cheer-cheer?</em><br />
And Orpheus, did he call out to his wife?<br />
Did she step out of the kitchen?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was the cook who held me,<br />
dying. Thomas loved me more<br />
in retrospect, dipping</p>
<p>his pen in the well,<br />
resurrecting Cornwall.<br />
On his writing desk,</p>
<p>he kept a calendar<br />
set to March 7<sup>th</sup>, the day<br />
we met, a fetish</p>
<p>galling to Florence,<br />
his second wife. She<br />
must have been in shock</p>
<p>to split him up<br />
like that: his ashes<br />
taken to the Abbey<br />
<em> </em><br />
<em>for the nation to revere, </em><br />
his heart here with me<br />
in Stinsford churchyard.</p>
<p>I would have vetoed<br />
the cremation.<br />
Each of us, wanting</p>
<p>so much to be first,<br />
failed to see<br />
Thomas loved best</p>
<p>no woman in the flesh<br />
but the daughter<br />
of his mind: <em>my Tess.</em></p>
