								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nick Ripatrazone</p>
<p><em>The Glass Crib</em> by Amanda Auchter. Zone 3 Press, 2011.</p>
<p>“There is no pain but the bodily”: so begins “The Ecstasy of Saint Theresa,” the final in a sequence of saint-themed poems in <em>The Glass Crib</em>, Amanda Auchter’s debut collection. Theresa’s claim is reflected throughout a book concerned with the corporal. Auchter saves her persona poems of those canonized for the final quarter of the book, but the entire work is a document of variations of sainthood: human imperfection cleansed through the gift of enduring faith.</p>
<p>Imperfect mothers&#8211;sometimes nearly burdened by pregnancy&#8211;populate <em>The Glass Crib</em>, and their laments coalesce: “As you grow older, / do not imagine me&#8211; / you will never get it right.” “A Late Blooming,” a heartbreaking poem that practically justifies the entire collection, encapsulates the complexity of birth. Auchter artfully directs the poem toward the later absent mother, and the lines carry so much regret:</p>
<p>For months<br />you fed me air, vodka, saltines, small</p>
<p>unnoticeable meals, enough for you<br />to gain just ten pounds of water, the pale<br />tissues of my heartbeat and bones.</p>
<p>“Vodka,” tucked mid-line, increases its strength. Auchter creates such frailty in the pregnant form, and wonders: what, exactly, does a mother owe a child? “Ten pounds of water” gained in this pregnancy meant a life barely changed, at least physically, and yet a world of internal metamorphosis. The poem turns back to an earlier work in the book by stating, almost in whisper, that “I want to think / of you better than you were.” The desire is not empty fantasy: although the narrator’s birth mother “pushed through the doors” of the adoption agency “into / the February dusk,” offering her child to another family, the absolute connection of birth is never lessened by distance. The child, rather than living in anger, would rather think “of how / you spoke to me when no one was listening.”</p>
<p>Auchter returns to the particular pain of separation in “Limbo for the Miscarry” and “Childless,” where another mother “was not / thinking of the daughter my body / could not grow.” Faced with an inability to birth, this mother continues on, steadfast, almost fighting against an indiscriminate evil that steals life: “I will not eat for two. I will not leave the house / with bags of Cheerios or crackers or stash / juice boxes in my purse.” The proclamation turns blunt: “There will be no / vomit, shit, hungry crying at 3 am.”<br />Anger is to be expected from such loss, but this is an anger of forward action, not static mourning. In “To the Unborn,” the mundane action of the character, to “wash and dry this / basket of apples” is sometimes enough to satiate heavy memory. One of Auchter’s skills in <em>The Glass Crib</em> is to coax grief anew, as the narrator notes “each version of you spools / in the red scarves, the names / I wrote down, then erased.”</p>
<p>In the second section of the book, “Without,” Auchter turns from maternal elegies to meditations on lost siblings. “Extreme Unction” crafts the deliberate action of blessing, and the narrator knows that though “all of this can be repaired&#8211; / fingers splinted, bones unbroken / again,” she accepts that there is “something lost on her face / I can’t get back.” Scars are given pulse by memory, and are sometimes further wound by time, and those left behind to grieve must either remain in the stasis of pain or turn elsewhere. In “O Sinner Come Home,” the narrator leaves “the dirty sink, the casserole dish. Mother / with her stack of forks, a rosary,” and most importantly “the white sheet covering my brother’s body.” Her “teenaged self” leaves absolute pain for temporary love, and her “lover’s mouth erases what can be erased.” The reader is compelled to forgive the narrator’s decision.<br />This call for compassion continues in “The Bottom Drawer,” where idiosyncratic grief is made acceptable and necessary. A mother keeps her son’s pajamas after he has passed, and the narrator wonders if “she wears them . . . if at night she slips / into bed with the shirt, cradles him / back into her.” “Keepsake” dramatizes another unusual collection: hair. A trunk is found “filled with the comb-teeth / scrapings, scraps of baby-wisps, my knotted / snarls.”</p>
<p>The tendency to save and assign meaning feels iconographic, and prepares the reader for the final section of the book, “Bring Splendor.” <em>The Glass Crib</em> is the newest in a revival of the Catholic poetic aesthetic. Sarah Vap’s <em>Faulkner’s Rosary</em>, Mary Biddinger’s <em>Saint Monica</em>, and C. Dale Young’s <em>Torn</em> appropriate the ritual, imagery, and cadence of Roman Catholicism in a complicated manner. These contemporary poets, along with Auchter, move from strict orthodoxy and craft works far stronger than devotional verse, and yet they all find solace in the corporal lexicon of the religion.</p>
<p>A woman considers adultery, but ultimately chooses to remain faithful. A mother implores her frustrated daughter to “offer it up,” and she does, her “knees to the floor / [to] give it all back to the God / who asked me to bear it.” These are people who struggle to remain faithful to God and family, and yet who find salvation in those same places. “Bring Splendor” transitions from everyday flashes of faith to the travails of those later canonized into legend. Auchter’s saints suffer. Saint Agatha’s “flesh / spooled in [a knife’s] rusted light.” Saint Cecilia, later incorrupt, remained with “roped hands” in a room with “no window, / but stone walls” for days until her death. Saint Catherine’s pain is even worse: “how my bones break, how the sling- / shot twangs and splits / my lip.” When Catherine “ask[s] of death,” she does so not to stop the torture, but to embrace the beyond of her belief.</p>
<p>These poems are not mere documentation of bodily suffering. The Catholic literary aesthetic has always revered the pained person of Christ&#8211;from the whisky priest in Graham Greene’s <em>The Power and the Glory</em> to the stigmatic novitiate in Ron Hansen’s <em>Mariette in Ecstasy</em>&#8211;finding unfortunate beauty in the desire to self-sacrifice. Auchter’s saint-themed poems lead into the powerful “Glossolalia,” where the lines “Let me speak of belief, / its small sounds in the distance, its ear / its tongue, the quite murmur of flood and field” feel appropriate to encapsulate the entire collection. <em>The Glass Crib</em> is an honest book of poetry, where imperfect narrators and subjects abound, and yet a certain hope arises from these lines, a hope coaxed into life by the poet’s care with words and her subjects.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ashley Gray Billman<br /> <em>Break the Skin</em> by Lee Martin (Crown, 2011)</p>
<p>Deception and lies, love triangles and witchcraft, unfulfilled dreams and trailer parks, desperation and accidental murder. These elements, so often associated with salacious romance novels, fill the pages of Pulitzer Prize winning author Lee Martin’s latest novel, <em>Break the Skin</em>.  And yet, Martin’s refreshingly straight-forward prose and carefully developed characters bear little resemblance to that genre, elevating the novel instead to the realm of serious literature. In order to tell his tale, Martin skillfully employs two female protagonists to communicate a uniquely feminine perspective. Martin’s ability to capture the loneliness and intense desire for love and companionship that effortlessly drives the novel’s often desperate and fatal actions is so successful that his characters haunt the reader long after the final sentences. Whether we can truly identify with any of the novel’s thorny twists and turns is irrelevant; rather, Martin’s tale reminds us to take comfort in the control we can exercise over our own destinies.</p>
<p>The action in <em>Break the Skin</em> alternates between two Midwestern towns separated by hundreds of miles. The first, Mt. Gilead, Illinois, takes center stage as the home of Elaine “Laney” Volk, one of the novel’s two protagonists. Laney grows up in an even smaller town just outside Mt. Gilead – New Hope, population 212 – and throughout the novel she traverses between locales. Laney’s feelings about New Hope need little explanation and provide clarity about the environment in which she was raised, her own character, and those she calls her friends:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A bedroom community to Mt. Gilead, if you wanted to give this a positive spin. A ho-hum, no chance-in-hell town if you wanted to tell the truth. A nowhere place in southeastern Illinois, laid out in the middle of farmland, a town of retired folks and too many meth addicts and people just waiting for the next thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not surprisingly, the desolation and absolute inertia Laney associates with her hometown mirror her feelings about herself. She describes herself as “a nothing kind of girl,” who works as a cashier at the local Wal-Mart, living an “unremarkable life,” “scared and shy,” “starved for love.”</p>
<p> Laney and two friends, Delilah Dade and Rose MacAdow, comprise a trio self-described as a “sisterhood of lonely hearts” with an intense “ache for love.” The extent to which that ache eats at each of these women’s hearts is palpable as each experiences love found and love lost. It is this same ache and trauma that is largely responsible for the final, violent clash between Delilah and Rose over a man they both love, Russell Swain, aka “Tweet.”</p>
<p>When Martin introduces his co-protagonist, Betty “Miss Baby” Ruiz, the narrative jumps hundreds of miles south to Denton, TX. With Miss Baby’s character, Martin quickly but effectively reveals his hand – Miss Baby and Laney are kindred spirits. Wholly apart from her unfulfilled soul, Miss Baby, a forty-year-old, single tattoo artist, endures a myriad of other problems, including a brother, Pablo, whose occupation as a cattle rustler has landed him in a world of trouble with the most dangerous man in North Texas, Virgil “Slam” Dent, and Pablo’s ex-wife, Carolyn, who finds every way possible to blame Miss Baby for her problems. Miss Baby, “a Mexican girl who knew she wasn’t pretty like the gringas,” comes from a long line of “hurt hearts”: “I suppose I was like my mami, looking for the next good thing, ready to seize the day my life turned around and … I could be who I knew I was: Betty Ruiz, Miss Baby, tender in the heart and eager for love.”</p>
<p>When a strange man shows up in Denton, lost and confused, Miss Baby jumps at the chance to make him her own. Little does she know, though, that this man, whom she renames Donnie True, is actually Lester Stipp, who Martin first introduces in Mt. Gilead as Laney’s love interest. Lester, an Iraqi war veteran, suffers from dissociative fugues, that is, mental blackouts that make him forget his identity and jump on the next bus out of town. Miss Baby knows “it was a fool thing to do” to make up their marriage and happy life together but, again, like Laney and Delilah, and Rose for that matter, she is driven by a force larger than herself, the ache for love that can quickly push a person over the edge of rational thinking. Even Miss Baby willingly admits: “I wasn’t living in the sane, rational world,” and “I understood what had sent mami out night after night looking for someone to make her feel less alone. I wanted more than she had. I wanted a man to stay with me forever.” Martin repeatedly develops situations where we know more than his characters and have premonitions about how things will play out before they do, thereby creating a moral imperative to pass judgment. Yet, despite our personal inclinations toward truth and honesty, our reaction to Miss Baby’s lies and deception is one of sympathy not disgust.</p>
<p>Eventually the tangled knot of lies and stories comes unraveled and the truth reveals itself. As Laney poignantly notes: “…everybody had to answer for the things they’d done.” For Miss Baby, like the others, the truth hurts: “The most painful thing of all was what I saw about myself … It’s a sin to want too much.” While Lester is busy creating a life with Miss Baby, Laney has been implicated and charged in a terrible crime involving Delilah, Rose, and Tweet. Miss Baby can no longer maintain the charade regarding their faux-marriage after Lester’s face appears on the evening news, wanted for questioning for that same crime back in Mt. Gilead.</p>
<p> Following Lester back to Illinois, Miss Baby comes face to face with her counterpart, Laney. Finally, in a tense courthouse scene, Miss Baby observes Laney fighting for her freedom: “When she looked at me in that courtroom, her state went all the way to my heart, and I felt what we shared: a desire to be loved.” As Laney pleads for her innocence she sums up the fatal mess left in the wake of the preceding two-hundred-plus pages:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was the idiocy of people so starved for love they didn’t have a thought in their heads of how easily their lives could spin out of control. That was the story of Lester and me, and Rose and Tweet, and Delilah. A story of want. A story of greed, but under it all a story of fear, which was the same as love when push came to shove, and you found yourself shaking with the thought that you might never find someone, that you’d always be alone in a world where everyone but you – you’d swear this to be true—was happy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this final moment, Laney is so completely vulnerable and helpless that, once again, we cannot help but feel sorry for her and understand, without being able to imagine, how she got herself into this position.</p>
<p>Although <em>Break the Skin</em> is an emotionally exhausting read at times, Lee Martin ultimately leaves us completely satisfied. From the shadow of the Midwestern trailer park lifestyle inhabited by Martin’s characters comes Laney’s warning that “you could be that person you saw sometimes on the news, that person who’d done something unforgivable and could barely face it. Trust me … It can happen.” Whether or not we are content with where our lives lead us, we, like Laney, control the decisions we make and in large part, our destinies. While Miss Baby may be luckier than Laney, at the end of the novel, she, too, faces the reality that her bad choices have led her to the mess in which she finds herself. Despite her predicament, however, she now has “a story of love, no matter how roughed up and ugly and stained … Tomorrow and for always. The truest story I know.” By concluding with an image of stories and storytelling, Martin softens an otherwise dismal tone, ending on a hopeful, albeit melancholy, note. As <em>Break the Skin</em> draws to a close, we realize that we all have our own stories that, like Miss Baby’s tattoos, mark us to our very core, far deeper than the surface of our skin, stories that we must remember and share so we never stray too far from our true selves as we strive to maintain the delicate balance that defines and controls our lives.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <em>What Harvest: Poems on the Siege &amp; Battle of the Alamo</em> by Floyd Collins (Somondoco Press, 2011)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 150%;"> I have not thought much, if any, about the Alamo since elementary school.<span>  </span>If high school or college history books discussed it, those chapters were not assigned.<span>  </span>Before reading this fourth collection from Floyd Collins, any mention of the Alamo would have routed my memory to Davy Crockett and then, inevitably, to Fess Parker, who portrayed both Crockett and Daniel Boone on television in the mid-1950s and 60s.<span>  </span>So comfortably uninformed had I become about the Alamo story that I ran the risk of never considering the episode again or, worse, seeing it only through a veil of glorification and nostalgia.<span>  </span>I have Floyd Collins to thank for changing that.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 150%;">Each reading of <em>What Harvest </em>engaged me, but that engagement was sometimes driven by the narrative force of Collins’s writing, sometimes by his pitch-perfect diction, and still at other times by the music of individual poems.<span>  </span>I was surprised at each reading that I had not been paying closer attention to the other elements.<span>  </span>Collins’s grasp of the history and myth of the Alamo is impressive, but he animates the narrative as much through making readers care about the characters as he does by providing details of the plot.<span>  </span>The first poem, “James Bowie: Bexar, 1836,” shows the last moments of one of the battle’s most famous warriors.<span>  </span>The succeeding two poems, however, tell pre-Alamo anecdotes that lend corporeality to the wispy figure that rises from the story of the siege and its conclusion.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 150%;"><span>  </span>Readers will appreciate Collins’s painstaking research and his introduction of John McGregor, Gregorio Esparza, and William Barret Travis, lesser-known figures, in addition to his perspective-enhancing portrayals of legends such as Bowie and Crockett.<span>  </span>The most remarkable piece of narrative in the collection, however, is “Santa Anna’s Spurs,” at five pages the longest poem in the volume.<span>  </span>Collins traces the Mexican general’s spurs from a smith’s forge in Mexico City in 1834 to the Alamo, to Santa Anna’s surrender to General Winfield Scott in 1847, through a surprising exchange at Appomattox, and finally to Little Big Horn.<span>  </span>Even if <em>What Harvest</em> had nothing else to recommend it, this poem would justify the purchase.<span>  </span>Fortunately, that’s not the case.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 150%;">Although I do not know what Collins has been up to during the eight years since the publication of <em>Forecast</em>, his most recent poetry volume before <em>What Harvest</em>, his impeccable employment of period diction suggests that he has devoted much of that interim to research.<span>  </span>The range of the poet’s vocabulary itself is a treat.<span>  </span>I have read few poems that could incorporate both “delectations” and “prestidigitator” (“The Natchez Sandbar Fight”) without leaving me feeling bullied.<span>  </span>Verbal dexterity aside, however, Collins’s use of 19<sup>th</sup> century diction enhances the imagery; it thrills and informs without distracting.<span>  </span>These are poems in which “forenoon,” “furlongs,” and “mephitic vapors” not only fit but seem essential.<span>  </span>Collins seems completely at ease in this world.<span>  </span><em>What Harvest</em> is devoid of those sour notes struck when history is used as an ornament, or a bludgeon.<span>  </span>Here, when “Degüello” appears, as it does throughout the collection, I do not pass over it but revel in its connotations of both music and knife shaft.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 150%;">The power and precision of Collins’s narrative would be sufficient to carry this volume, but the poems’ subtle, pervasive music makes them beautiful.<span>  </span>When I read “the hoofprints / Of my Appaloosa oozing shut behind me . . .” in “Bonham in <em>Extremis</em>,” I realized that Collins is not only a fine storyteller but a bard.<span>  </span>In <em>What Harvest</em>, Collins illustrates emphatically that narrative poetry is alive and well and that narrative poets do not have to sacrifice lyricism on story’s high altar.<em></em></p>
