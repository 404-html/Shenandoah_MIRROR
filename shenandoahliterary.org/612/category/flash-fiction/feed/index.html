								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mine would be just another story about a menopausal woman leaving a thirty-year marriage to an orthopedic surgeon for her tango teacher, except that I’m a surgical nurse, joined the US Army, and ended up in wartime Iraq. I’ve almost forgotten about Paolo, slithering around in those black leather pants, and that I was smitten enough to blow my divorce settlement, buy him a dance studio and believe we’d run it together.</p>
<p>Triage is life, limb, or eyesight, here at Al Asad, the only US military hospital in west Iraq. I’m Head Nurse in the OR and my scrubs have a custom pocket for a 9mm Glock. It’s perverted to stand at an operating table, armed and dangerous, sopping up blood, saving someone’s life while poised and ready to kill someone else.  When I see a shredded femoral artery or cradle torn bowels in my hands, I count steps to a <em>pasodoble</em> and relive the ecstasy of strutting and spinning in a young man’s muscular arms.</p>
<p>Scowling Marines with M-16s surround our hospital but we’re all too exhausted and anxious to pay attention to anyone’s mood. We don’t give a shit if no one smiles for days at a time. More choppers mean more sleepless nights.</p>
<p>My own kids are older than my nursing staff and yes, I’m too old for this, but I need money, a military pension won’t hurt, and I’m experienced in wartime surgery so they want me in spite of my age. In the early 90’s, my son enlisted to fight in Desert Storm and I cajoled his fine surgeon of a father into joining up with me; we’d all go together, one patriotic family. My husband did anything I asked for three decades and I can’t remember now why I thought he was boring.</p>
<p>Most of the Iraqis we treat are our informers and I can tell how poor they are by the holes in their shoes and the gaps in their teeth. Their faces contort with terror of being recognized when they leave our hospital because insurgents hide in plain sight. Even gaping gunshot wounds stagger in with an interpreter who stays only a minute or two, then skulks away. I communicate with hand gestures and gentle touch, bury my concern beneath my mask.</p>
<p>It’s blast furnace hot and the dust storms are as blinding as blizzards back in East Lansing.  Dust sticks to my sweaty skin, congeals into reddish-brown paste in my nose and mouth. Standard issue goggles protect our eyes, even inside the tents, and balaclava covers our faces, necks, and ears. At least the toilets flush.</p>
<p>There’s a Burger King on base and I’m puke sick of Army chow, would love a Whopper and fries, but our mercenary Ugandan guards tell women not to walk alone, night or day, even with our Glocks. Too many sexual assaults they say, and of course, the snakes.</p>
<p>Lots of accidental shootings here but not among Marines. They’re tough as roofing nails, fearless, itchy to use their weapons. I stitched up a twenty-year-old jarhead last week; no anesthetic, deep, eighteen-inch gash down his face, neck, and chest, and when I clipped the suture he focused deep into my eyes, “Thank you for your service to our country, Major. And for helping me.”</p>
<p>Black vinyl body bags are packed in ice in their coffins for the trip home. When the C-5s land stateside, the coffins are off-loaded and guys on base open them, suck all the water out with shop vacs and then close them up for escort home to their families.</p>
<p>I had a skin lesion removed from my neck a week ago and it came back cancer but the doc said he got all of it. No big deal. I went shopping after the surgery. Army &amp; Air Force Exchange Services allow the Turks and Iraqis to run little shops here on base. I bought a Heriz design pillow and spicy apple tea.</p>
<p>Paolo used to kiss that spot on my neck; called the lesion a beauty mark.</p>
<p>The scar is small.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In their first conjugal visit, Ray couldn’t perform, so they talked.  The trailer had no windows and one door from which the lock mechanism had been removed, the hole stuffed with a rust-colored rag.  On the dresser beside the bed was a clock radio and across the room, a sink with a mirror.  The walls were so thin they could hear the footsteps of the guard on the gravel just outside.  But for a chair to throw their clothes over, that was it for furnishings.  The bed was a single; lying on their sides, squeezed close together, they barely fit.</p>
<p>You smell different, he told her, like a schoolteacher, and she’s cut her hair too short.</p>
<p>Well, Kelly said, sassing him right back, you’re a sight for sore eyes, too.</p>
<p>He had bulked up pumping iron.  But for the fact that he’d screwed up badly once again, she wasn’t sure it was him lying there, and she told him so.</p>
<p>You changed, she said, adding: You’re hard as a rock.</p>
<p>Except where it counts, he said.  It surprised Ray how quickly she’d shed her clothes.  She had come all this way just to let him have sex with her, and yet she didn’t blame him when he couldn’t perform.  He owed her big-time.</p>
<p>I didn’t mean that, she was quick to say.  You got a new body.  It’s . . . <em>swollen</em>.</p>
<p>She turned on the radio to static but quickly found a crackly country and western station.  Weeping guitars, a rock ‘ n’ roll beat, satin-smooth harmonies – Ray groaned in disgust.</p>
<p>What’s wrong?</p>
<p>What passes for music these days, he said.  Remember when country singers looked bad and sang good?</p>
<p>From nearby came the cries of a man and woman furiously coupling.  With the radio turned low, they could almost hear them breathe.  The rhythm picked up, the bed rattled, and something heavy fell to the floor.</p>
<p>Here come the Oh Gods, Kelly Said, and sure enough, the man called out to the Almighty.</p>
<p>Kelly glanced over and caught him taking in her breasts, which weren’t bad for 32 years of hard living, two kids, no time for aerobics and no money for the day spa.</p>
<p>Cursing freely, the couple in the next trailer were building to a climax.</p>
<p>He’s in for murder, Ray joked.  I hope she makes it out alive.</p>
<p>She turned up the radio.  The DJ announced a contest.  One thousand dollars to the lucky caller who could name the song and the artist in the next 97 seconds.</p>
<p>What would you do with a thousand dollars? she asked.</p>
<p>Blow it on weed, unless you got hold of it first.</p>
<p>You ain’t nothing if not honest, she had to admit.  Instead of lecturing him, Kelly recounted family stories, Junior’s Pee-wee football heroics, Brittany’s sleepover at the Science Museum, her mother’s back surgery.  He hadn’t asked about any of it, but she had learned that he didn’t always know how to ask.</p>
<p>So what do I have to be worried about? she asked.</p>
<p>Well, I’d appreciate it if you didn’t sleep with my brother, he joked.  She slapped him on his bicep.  The muscle felt like bronze.  How hard was he inside? she wondered, how could she find out without asking?</p>
<p>Momma sends her . . . whatever it is mother-in-laws send when they told you so.</p>
<p>It’s a good thing she ain’t into voodoo, he joked.</p>
<p>She’s a good Christian woman, Ray, you know that.  She prays for you.  She watches the kids so I can come see you.  She don’t complain.</p>
<p>I know, I know.  She thinks I’m a devil, is all.</p>
<p>She never said that.  She thinks you follow the devil, but she also thinks you ain’t smart enough to lead.  It’s a compliment, if you think about it.</p>
<p>Sometimes it seemed that their brand of teasing was all that carried them through fourteen years of marriage, two separations, and now his eighteen months in the penitentiary.  They could always laugh.  Back in the early, crazy days before kids, the only time she could talk sense with him was right after he climaxed.  She had about twenty minutes, she figured out after a difficult year of marriage, to make her case before he got up, put on his jeans and wandered out the door.</p>
<p>Sorry ‘bout not bein’ in the mood, he said.  It’s this . . . scene.</p>
<p>She held up a hand, then waved it in a slow downward arc.  It’s ain’t the Marriott, she agreed, twisting his wedding band on his finger, an old intimate gesture.</p>
<p>A loud knock at the door.  Five minutes!</p>
<p>You ain’t trying to take my ring off, are you?</p>
<p>Just makin’ sure it fits.  She kissed him on the cheek, he kissed her back, and in an instant he was on top of her and the deed was done.</p>
<p>That was like high school, she said, chewing on his ear lobe.</p>
<p>Not my high school, he lamented.  Can you come next month?  He sounded desperate, even to himself, and feared the timbre of his voice.</p>
<p>It’s two hundred miles, Ray, she whispered.  It’s gas money.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I used up all my days off.  I’m supposed to be sick in bed right now.</p>
<p>And I’m supposed to be dead, baby.  Miracles happen.</p>
<p>Not to people like us.</p>
<p>It’s a miracle you’re here right now.</p>
<p>What simple declaration – and the conviction he’d put behind it – touched her, turned her.  She laid her hand across his chest and felt his ribs.  Here lay the old Ray, tender and foolish, and easily broken.</p>
<p>I’ll be back, she said, reaching for her bra.</p>
<p>You know where to find me, he said.</p>
<p>On the drive home, she tuned in some old-time music and of all songs, Patsy Cline singing “Crazy.”  She had to laugh before she started crying. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Spirits at Nzinga&#8217;s Feet</strong></p>
<p>Twilight settles along the coast of Angola, where Nzinga has been placed at water’s edge.  A village, home for all her thirteen years, lies behind – she can sense its dying fires flickering against her bended back.  A brooding Portuguese ship looms on the dark horizon ahead.   She and the others have been traded as goods by a Mbundu king for European copperware, cloth, wine and guns.  Nzinga digs her brown feet ankle-deep into the beige sand, burying the biting shackle, prays a gentle wave washes them free.  The sand flees back to sea but the shackles remain, and Nzinga knows she won’t see home again.  If lucky, she will survive the voyage to see a distant shore that she doesn’t know and can’t imagine.  Or she might die in the dark cargo hold of the diseased ship, her soul tossed over to join the legions of slave spirits sinking through the lightless depth.</p>
<p><strong>Grab and Go<br /> </strong></p>
<p>Pinky, youngest daughter of the Angolan slave Nzinga, is the only <em>Negroe</em> in the slave pen to have been born in South Carolina.  This bestows value &#8211; she already speaks English and knows how a slave must behave.  The others, fresh Africans, were dragged blinking into the harsh sun from the dank hold of the cargo ship, the dead stink of their journey scrubbed away and their skin rubbed with tar to make them shine.  The tar burns their eyes and they fight, but Pinky knows not to resist.  The scars on her back remind her.  This is a “Grab and Go” auction, different from age six when Pinky was first ripped from Nzinga’s embrace and sold.  That one had been “Sold to the Highest Bidder”.  But that bidder has fallen on hard times and Pinky is for sale again.  For hours, she and the Africans have been prodded, had their mouths pried opened and their genitals examined.  Then with the metallic clang of a copper bell, the gate swings open and the buyers rush to claim their goods.  Two fight over Pinky, yanking at her arms, but Pinky is quiet, eyes closed, praying to her mother’s ancestral God.  He is her only respite.<strong><br /> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Chains of Love<br /> </strong></p>
<p>Elizabeth prays to her Lord Christ over her dying husband, Hiram.  Elizabeth, the light-skinned daughter of her previous owner and his house servant, had been freed by him.  So when she fell in love with Hiram, she bought him – a slave – to secure their union.  They have loved for a lifetime under South Carolina’s Black Rules, but now he dies.   Elizabeth sings a song of mourning at Hiram’s final breath rattle, and as he tumbles gently into the afterlife, he returns to ancestral memory – to the beige beaches of his great-grandmother Nzinga’s Angola, to the drums and songs and colorful garb of a people he’s never known.<strong><br /> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Fires of Freedom<br /> </strong></p>
<p>The words are whispered mouth-to-ear in hopeful, frightened silence.   A house slave overhears his master, tells a field slave who scuttles them by mule to a neighbor’s nanny.  And so on.  The news travels from Washington to Greenville like a quiet, lovely telegraph.  The night songs in the slave quarters grow louder, happier, the words spiraling upwards in the darkness like the sparks rising from the fires of Angola.  Lincoln has signed papers emancipating all, and when the Union army reaches South Carolina, freedom will be claimed.  Glory, glory be, the songs ring through the night.<strong><br /> </strong></p>
<p><strong>1968<br /> </strong></p>
<p>Hope evaporates as the news flies ‘round the world:  Martin Luther King has been shot in Memphis.  From Birmingham to Washington, Oakland to Greenville, Angola and beyond, heart and breath and home and shop all go up in flame.  The embers of equality become the fires of revolt, and neighbor watches neighbor with distrust-ringed eyes.  After the flames die down, a lingering darkness settles over all of America.  We wonder – will the dawn ever come?<strong><br /> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Original or Extra-Crispy?<br /> </strong></p>
<p>“Original or extra-crispy?  Mac-and-cheese or mashed potatoes?”  Sholanda, dressed in a shabby KFC uniform, queries the next customer in line.  Her tone is dull; there is no fire.  She tucks an unruly loc beneath the franchise-issued baseball cap.  She hates being here, but being here is as good as an uneducated girl from the ghetto can do.  Sholanda accepts her place in this life.  Sad.  She doesn’t recognize that her Angolan ancestors invented this fried chicken in the slave quarters, or that the hip hop music playing in the background is rooted in African rhythms.  She doesn’t recognize the many contributions of her people.  Poverty blinds her.  All she sees is that there ain’t no breaks for a poor girl from Greenville, even though a black man finally presides over the country.  She only knows he don’t, no one don’t, in no way, represent her.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thick Russian night is shifting, sighing underneath the windows, asking to be let inside. She’s sad to be all by herself on the streets, lonely. You can’t see anything through the windows &#8211; they are covered with ice, dusted with snow. I’m sitting on the windowsill. Every few minutes I breathe on a copper coin, stick it to the glass and then look out through the little, thawed circle. It feels like the whole world is made of snow and blueness and that our home is not a home at all, but a magical ship that is falling headlong into something, and that it will continue falling like this forever.</p>
<p>Grandfather is at the kitchen table, drinking tea, reading a newspaper. His glasses are at the very tip of his nose and it seems that any moment they will slip off, but they don’t.</p>
<p>“Do me a favor, will you,” his eyes are above the glasses now, looking at me. “Go get something from my coat. It’s in the study, inside pocket.”</p>
<p>The coin is put aside; windowsill abandoned; I go into my favorite room.  There’s a green leather couch and moose antlers with hats hanging on them and bookcases that reach all the way up to the ceiling and a glass-door cabinet with all sorts of wonderful things &#8211; stone grapes on a metal vine, empty tortoise shell, peacock fan, wooden jewelry box with legs shaped like rose buds, Vietnamese vases, a mother-of-pearl snuffbox. There’s also a big desk with a matching chair. I like the desk terribly because its sides are studded with little round nails and it has a built-in inkwell.</p>
<p>My grandfather’s coat is hanging on the chair, smelling like wet leather and winter. I reach inside, feel around, my fingers close around something small, cold. I pull out a little oval tin box, the size of my palm. I gently put it on the table and examine it. It’s the most beautiful thing that I’ve ever seen. It’s plum colored and the top has a drawing of a young woman in a corset dress. There are vines, little cherubs and violets all around her and something is written underneath in foreign letters that I can’t understand. I hold my breath and stare; I don’t want to take it back just yet.</p>
<p>My grandfather comes in, stands behind me. “Did you find it?”</p>
<p>I touch the box very lightly, afraid of leaving a smudge.</p>
<p>“It’s so pretty, prettier than anything.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s good to know because it’s a present for someone very important. Do you think she’ll like it?”</p>
<p>I look up in amazement. The thought of someone not liking it is so incomprehensible that I study my grandfather with suspicion, thinking that he’s playing a joke. But he’s serious. He sits on the couch, shadows eat away his face. The house is silent and I feel like I’m being let in on a special, grown-up secret.</p>
<p>“Everyone would like it,” I finally say with conviction. “Even the president. Even a movie star.”</p>
<p>My grandfather works for the government. He goes to a lot of meetings and sometimes brings people over, and grandmother wears her best dress and puts on perfume and I am allowed to stay up later than usual. I decide that the box must be a present for someone that my grandfather works with, because these people seem so different from us, from anyone. They use the word “imported” a lot. Imported clothes, imported furniture, imported cars. Still, I think to myself, none of them deserve this particular treasure.</p>
<p>We sit in silence for a few moments. I close my eyes and try to envision the woman who should own the violet box. I decide that she should be from some faraway, magical country like Lapland. She lives in a beautiful house with a spiral staircase, wears velvet shoes and has a sleigh with bells and red cushions.</p>
<p>“Do you want to know who it’s for?” asks my grandfather, still invisible.</p>
<p>What kind of a question is that? Of course I do.</p>
<p>He leans forward, beckons with a finger, cups his hand around my ear. His cheek is rough, prickly and warm.</p>
<p>“You.”</p>
<p>I pull back, astonished, almost hurt.</p>
<p>“You said it’s a present! It can’t be for me.”</p>
<p>“It is,” he says and he’s laughing and I know that he’s telling the truth.</p>
<p>I sit next to him on the couch; we open the box. Underneath a layer of white parchment paper I discover hard candy. Each one is dusted with powdered sugar and shaped like a little violet, with exactly five petals. We each take one. I look inside and there are still so many, enough to last a lifetime. Moose antlers are hanging above our heads. The night is knocking against the windows. Our home-ship is rushing, flying through the snow, through the wind, through the endless blue that is all around.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oriole Street curled back from Light Avenue, rose and twisted, fell, twisted again, and ended at the edge of weeds, an old grape arbor, and a ramble of wild roses. Regina lived at the end of the Oriole Street in what had been a caretaker’s house, and the overgrown field had been the grounds of a mansion. The mansion had burned down. A few blackened bricks from the chimney remained, and in the field was a stone bench, curved in such a way that two people sitting there touched knees.</p>
<p>Regina had no cats and did not brew pots of herbal tea. She did not have a loom or a godmother, and she was as ordinary looking as a blade of grass. She had a lover, with whom she ate eggs in the morning and whose whistle, gait, and way of stirring soup were as familiar as a childhood rhyme. One day her lover decided to go on a journey. He had read many fairy tales when he was a boy, and he felt that to be a man he must have an adventure.</p>
<p>He sent her a picture of fish that stared out of solemn, barred faces. Another card showed tiers of bleached villas perched on a cliff between two blue lines, the sky and the sea. Regina searched this picture for a sign of wind, but found no trees or people or laundry hung to dry. On the table in her kitchen, under a window gripped by ivy, the postcards leaned hot and vivid against a vase. They did not fade.</p>
<p>She imagined herself the curtain, feeling the wind blowing her in and out. The electric clock burbled when the long hand passed over the short one; butter clogged a slice of bread; the window cracked in the corner; the edges of the wild roses in the vase wrinkled into brown, and Regina felt herself to be, in fleeting moments which had the slow texture of a dream, anything she saw.</p>
<p>She didn’t know what to think about this.</p>
<p>She was the picture of a fox on the wall, watching a woman sweep the kitchen floor.</p>
<p>Then she was inside a villa in the postcard. She heard the sea rise and fall. Sand filtered through the screened window. The walls were whitewashed and rough.</p>
<p>Her lover walked in the door with a burlap sack over his shoulder. The threads were the same brown crinkle of his hair. He pushed the sack under the single bed with the white sheet and white pillow. He lay down and wouldn’t tell her what was in the sack. There was a nail on the wall over the bed that nothing hung on. When the moon rose in the purple sky and was framed in the window, Regina tried to feel herself the moon but couldn’t. Her lover’s breath slowed and steadied.</p>
<p>Regina pulled the sack out, carried it to the doorstep, sat down and untied the string at the top. Inside, the sack was half-filled with small, dried leaves. They smelled sharp and unfamiliar. They crumpled when she touched them and left gray-green dust on her fingers.</p>
<p>Her lover was standing behind her, his knees pressed into her back.</p>
<p>“Why did you open it?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Because I’ve missed you,” she replied.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">“I don’t want you here,” he said, and she was back in her house again, looking at the vase of wild roses. Although there wasn’t a breeze, two petals fell off. Regina picked them up and rolled them between her fingers. They felt like newly washed skin. Just when the roses were beginning to die, they had the sweetest smell, delicate and dense, the trace of longing that remains after hope disappears.<strong></strong></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Morning was still gray with fog when the boy walked down to the harbor. A bigger boy had taken his favorite sleeping spot last night and he had not slept well, so he started this day early. He passed the closed shops and quiet rooms just above them, as yellow lights came on in some of the upstairs windows, silhouetting the rising people, stealing their mystery.</p>
<p>A rounded nub of black bread lay between the sea-misted cobblestones at his feet. He reached down. How had it lasted the whole night, he thought. Something or someone should have eaten it. In the past he had eaten pieces this small, but instead he closed his hand around it, and changed direction.</p>
<p>Soon he came to the pier where his father and mother had taken him before the war. He and his father would stand at the end and throw bread into the air for the seagulls, while his mother smiled, bundling herself against the breeze. The birds would dip in, snaring the pieces in flight.</p>
<p>The boy wondered why God had allowed his parents to go away. One evening during supper, men carrying rifles knocked roughly on their door and spoke to his father about joining the army. The boy was confused that they did not wear uniforms like regular soldiers. His father nodded to the men, his mother wept to herself. She filled a knapsack with clothes, cheese, and slices of dried meat, wiping the tears with the back of her wrist. Five months later his mother disappeared after one of her trips into the village to meet with the secret men. He did not like when his mother would leave, but he knew she had to meet with the secret agents because they had important information about where his father was to be found. Even though she brought home a burlap sack bulging with food, his mother was always sad because the agents never had any news. The boy thought that perhaps this last time his mother had received some special report and that she was still busy investigating. Sometimes he imagined his father and mother on a trail in the forest at night, hand in hand, working their way back to him, using the stars to guide them.</p>
<p>Only two gulls bobbed on the water below him, their wings neatly folded away. They did not take to the air, even when he used a trick his father had taught him by moving his arm up and down pretending to throw bread to get the birds to gather around them. He tossed the bread and one gull ate it off the water, the other too late.</p>
<p>As he walked back up the pier, he thought about miracles, the kind in which people got food from heaven. He wondered if things like that happened today. A wave slapped loudly against the pilings and he glanced down.</p>
<p>The silver fish foundered on its side in the shallows, mouth popping open for a gulp of water, flaps flaring on the exhale, dark red gills inside. It was longer than the boy’s leg, as thick as his thigh, perhaps injured or stunned; he was unsure. He ran until he found a spot low enough to jump into the water. The boy crashed through the shallows and grabbed the fish’s tail with both hands. The muscles along its flanks shivered. Hunched, he dragged the fish backwards, the sand running around his heels and back out to sea with the receding wash. The fish thrashed, its hard tail fin scraping into the boy’s palms, as he continued wading, step by step, back to land. The fish’s scales were hard, smooth, slick. The boy adjusted his grip, and fell.</p>
<p>Gone. When the fish escaped, it swam just beyond the boy’s reach and stopped, hovering there to rest. The boy stared at his palms, then balled them into fists. His arms shook as he slowly opened his hands and took a gentle step toward the fish. He stretched forward and touched the point of the tail fin. The fish kicked away with a shudder, disappearing into deeper water.</p>
<p>Climbing from the sea, the boy pulled off his shirt, wringing it out, splattering the cobblestones. He draped the shirt around his neck and began walking past the shops again, his pants heavy with saltwater.</p>
<p>“Kiro, have you fed my birds?”</p>
<p>The boy turned in the direction of the voice. He saw nothing.</p>
<p>“Kiro, up here.”</p>
<p>He looked up.</p>
<p>The woman leaned through the second story window, her forearms resting on the sill. She was pale and thin-faced, like nearly everyone had become during the war, wearing a faded blue kerchief that covered most of her short brown hair.</p>
<p>“You were out on the pier with my birds. I own them. Remember my paper from the Ministry saying so? So I ask again, have you fed my birds?”</p>
<p>He remembered his mother telling him how the war had made some people crazy, especially those who had lost loved ones. She also said they were to be pitied, but that he should say nothing to them. Over these years he had heard much strange talk, and this woman claiming she owned the seagulls did not scare him, so he answered.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Good, now come up and eat. Your breakfast is getting cold. And we will get you out of those wet clothes.”</p>
<p>As he walked to the shopfront door that led upstairs he wondered if this person Kiro had been her son, someone whom she had loved, then lost to the war. When he tried the door it was locked, but when he heard the woman coming down the wooden steps he smiled. She might know some things, he thought, like where to meet the secret agents. And she might know what forest his father and mother were in, what trail they were on, and what star was guiding them.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[[audio:http://shenandoahliterary.org/612/files/2011/08/Three-Scenarios-Luce.mp3|titles=Three Scenarios in Which Hana Sasaki Grows a Tail]
<p><strong>I.</strong> It is her thirtieth birthday. She wakes alone.</p>
<p>Her right hand reaches around to feel a soft length of hair that wasn’t there when she took her bath the night before.</p>
<p>She shuffles to the full-length mirror, cranes her neck. The tail is three inches long, and gleams silver with a lavender tinge, one end thin and flyaway, the other thick as rope. It sprouts from the asymmetrical dark button at the base of her spine—what her mother used to call her Hydrangea Mole. Her mother loved hydrangeas, but Hana found them a bit over-the-top. Hana prefers tulips.</p>
<p>She slides her palm beneath the tail and runs her thumb over the strands. Such softness, it’s like a baby’s chubby arm. The phone trills; her mother’s nasal sing-song tells the answering machine to keep a positive outlook; women far older than thirty are marrying nowadays.</p>
<p>Trembling, Hana steps into the shower. It’s too early to call a doctor and though the tail feels odd, it’s not exactly painful, and she can’t justify the expense and time of an emergency room visit. Water rolls down her back and soaks the bundle. It is thin, dark gray when wet, and the hair at the base rises out slightly from her back before wilting and following the curve of her bottom. She hesitates, then dabs shampoo into her palm and brings both hands behind her back: lather, rinse—and, why not?—condition. She lets the conditioner sit for three minutes before rinsing with cold water. Cold water will close the hair shaft and make for a silkier finish. Perhaps later she can braid it, dress it up with ribbon. She will care for it as only she can. </p>
<p><strong>II.</strong>  Hana has worked at the Asakusa Station Mister Donut for three years.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when business is slow, Hana calculates the number of possible destinations a person could attain with just two steps—the step on a train, and the one off. Thirty-five platforms, each servicing two or three lines, each line hitting ten to twenty stops, depending on the time of year, week, and day…. But Hana only visits platform 23, where the brown line collects and deposits her daily, to and from the thin-walled apartment she shares with her parents.</p>
<p>In the morning the faces that place orders are alert but by evening they sag, as if the population ages as the sun crosses the sky. But the next morning those expectant faces are back, ready for fresh fuel, slightly edited versions of the person they’d been the day before. Does she change, too? She feels no evidence of it. Sometimes she gets the sensation that time has frozen for her only, a glitch in relativity, as if she’s observing herself from a great distance.</p>
<p>She arranges a tray of the store’s signature donut, a plain cake ‘O’ with a baked-on handle for dipping in coffee. The donuts have tails, she thinks.</p>
<p>A man in a suit orders four of these signature donuts and slides the money over the counter atop a thick envelope. She makes change. When she looks up, he’s gone. He’s left not only his money, but the envelope, too. She picks it up and out spill photographs—of her.</p>
<p>She examines them, sharp corners pricking her palms. In each photo, she stands behind this very counter, wearing this red apron, hair tucked behind her ears, as it is now.</p>
<p>She twitches and slaps at her lower back; something has gotten into her waistband—a flea, maybe. </p>
<p><strong>III.</strong> Little Hana has just gotten over the chicken pox. To celebrate, her doting parents take her to the Ueno Zoo to see the red pandas, which their local zoo does not feature.</p>
<p>Hana does not like the Ueno Zoo. It is big, crowded, and the animals look upset. Hana wonders if the angry gorilla pounding at the glass is contagious, like her sickness. Contagious, she knows, means giving something bad to someone else, even if they don’t want it. That was how she got those chicken pox, and how she got rid of them. She clings to her mother, whimpering, worried that getting too close to a hideous, wrinkly grandma will make her ugly and old, too.</p>
<p>They leave the zoo. Father even springs for a taxi. As they stand on the street awaiting an available cab, a rat scrambles out of a trash bin and across Hana’s pink sneakers. The child is inconsolable all the way home, and Father must bribe the taxi driver to bring them the entire way.</p>
<p>The next day, it’s just as Hana expects: the pink, skinny, hairless tail sticks out just above the elastic on her underwear.  She grits her teeth and summons contagion.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>           Hank Teraoka looked around the Middle Eastern restaurant filled with the smells of curry. He felt uncomfortable in the dark room, sitting next to the curtained window and fingering the one-page plastic menu. He couldn’t help but catch glimpses of heavy brows, the cook’s black eyes staring from the kitchen, at him—a Japanese man in his eighties. Hank didn’t understand anything on the menu. Not the luncheon special—Shahi Korma? But it was cheap, a plate lunch for only $7.95 with something called basmati rice, which to his mind should be Calrose or Nikko sticky white rice.</p>
<p>          He had asked for the corner table where the light was brightest, where he and Teru had sat only nine months ago. Even then, he felt the two of them had been out of place—his wife’s Mariner sweatshirt zipped up tight against the cold. They had stopped at this restaurant because they’d always passed it on their way home from her kidney dialysis session. The background music with its lazy beat and quivery stringed instruments hadn’t mattered then.</p>
<p>          Hank lay the menu down against the bright orange tablecloth, picked up the water goblet and took a sip. He half expected to see his wife’s short white hair, the weight of her head tipping her chin down and making her look sleepy. Everything without Teru was a first time.</p>
<p>          The technicians at Day Vista Dialysis Center had hugged him, patting his back, when he brought the four boxes of Hawaii’s Best chocolate-covered macadamia nuts. “For taking such good care of my wife,” he had whispered, hoping his voice didn’t sound shaky—too emotional. At least there would be no more needles, no more tubes with dark red blood flowing in and out of the fistula in Teru’s left arm. She had never sat still, wanting to hurry up and go home. So many times when the technicians had been busy, he stood in, applying pressure with gauze squares to stop the bleeding. His fingers had grown stiff, their joints getting stuck. Finished for the day, she had always been hungry.</p>
<p>          “We have to try something new,” Teru had told him. Hank could tell by the sound of her voice that we meant you. He’d always been happy with a nice steak and green onions dipped into a small mound of salt. “So bad,” she used to shake her head at him. “No wonder you have high blood pressure.”</p>
<p>          The dialysis people had told her, no tomatoes! Eat lots of vegetables and protein. And after Teru’s last session, they had stopped at the strip mall. Here, where they saw the sign:  “Cedars Restaurant.” Right now, it bothered Hank—why couldn’t he remember her order? All he could think of was that the lunch had been something green.</p>
<p>          And then the waiter was by Hank’s side, a white sleeve stained with a swipe of yellow. What he wanted was Teru’s special teriyaki sauce, a meaty drumstick that Hank could dig his teeth into. He wanted the familiar ketchup taste with sugar and shoyu. Teru hadn’t made anything good since she started the dialysis treatments every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. She said it was easier to eat out. Teru had liked letting the menu be a surprise. Once she had ordered crepes wrapped in lettuce with a shallow dipping dish on the side filled with an oily-looking vinaigrette. They had been at a Vietnamese restaurant. Bending forward, she had murmured: “Ooo, that looks different!” But Hank was always looking for something he could recognize: beef, chicken, fish.</p>
<p>          The waiter, trying to be patient, clutched his order pad; the stubby pencil was poised to write. Hank had been sitting for at least fifteen minutes, and there were a dozen tables with business suits and student backpacks to wait on during the lunch rush.</p>
<p>          “This,” Hank said, finally pointing at random.</p>
<p>          “Vindaloo?” the waiter asked.</p>
<p>          Hank nodded his head vigorously to keep from mispronouncing the word. At least there had been pictures at the Thai place. With Teru, he had tried Jamaican, Greek, and Creole. “Where do you want to go next,” he had groaned. At home, alone now, all he had to look forward to was a can of Vienna sausages or deviled ham.</p>
<p>          Steam rose from the tray the waiter carried to his table. As the bowl was placed in front of him, Hank felt the spices sting his sinuses as he inhaled garlic and chili. Even his eyes teared up, and he had to dab at his nose with the paper napkin. Blinking hard, Hank picked up the spoon, waiting a moment to stare at the pork and potatoes swimming in a brown liquid. Teru always said, the first taste was the strangest, the most unfamiliar. Hank gulped the red wine and vinegar broth down. He could feel the heat travel past his tongue, the back of his throat. He could feel the slow burn along his esophagus. It reached into his chest. Nodding his head, Hank took a second bite. This mouthful was the same as a lot of other new foods he had eaten. He’d be able to manage finishing about half a portion. But that didn’t mean he had to like it.</p>

<p>The hardest part is the telling.</p>
<p>Courtesy makes him tell you his story. Good favor is hard to come by; he cannot risk enemies. Seated before your guests, cloaked in homage that is your due, you take it all in. The words, weariness, and despair of one who has seen his world torn asunder, carried it like a father upon his shoulders, dragged it by the hand through the cindered throng like a young balking son, left it behind, like a drudgingly slow wife. The city burns again with each retelling and we are once more betrayed. Strong walls and gates smoked down to embers, too late do we learn to fear strange gifts.</p>
<p>After the retainers have sought their beds, you call him to you. Lying in his arms, thinking him what the gods have promised, you come to know the fickleness of time and nature. The dice have already been cast. Priestess one day, whore the next. Honored widow; scorned wife. Daughter-in-law to the gods; woman turned wisp of smoke. Precarious is the love women fall prey to when they love the man in his power and his piety. The gods move among us without ever begging pardon. When you have done all that they require, then they ask for blood.</p>
<p>Bowers become pyres, and you rue the day you offered hospitality, just as you rue the night he came to your bed. See how Juno’s face blows like an unfettered wind! Now that it has come to this, you ask what it was all for. A woman’s glance— lingering too long—bringing discord and jealousy? An upstart’s prerogative to take that which was never his?</p>
<p>All for the ill-aimed flick of a spear against hollowed wood.</p>
