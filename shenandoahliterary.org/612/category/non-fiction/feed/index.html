								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Asking for it</em></p>
<p>I was young, still in Sunday school, when my mother told me the parable of the girl who was asking for it. That was the word she used, <em>girl. </em>I listened as we drove past the girl’s house, which frightened me in its hollow darkness, the way it looked shut-up and lonesome, the way its dark grey paint peeled off and left it stripped and no one was trying to make it any better.</p>
<p>The girl was nice, a Christian—two distinctions that go a long way in a small Midwestern town. But she was also a young mother of three with no man to speak of. And though my mother always said it’s what’s on the inside that counts, the moral of the story was that a girl can love Jesus on the inside, but she can walk a certain way, talk a certain way—or dress, work, clean her fork a certain way—that makes a man forget his commandments.</p>
<p>The girl’s mother, who babysat for me and seemed ancient with her grey hair in curlers, her faded cotton frocks and heavy body always propped before <em>The Price is Right </em>and afternoon soaps, warned her. “If you dress like that,” she said, “some man is going to get the wrong idea.” And sure enough, one night a man stole across the scrappy little yard and crawled through a window of the girl’s sorry grey house and had sex with her even though she said <em>No</em>.</p>
<p>In our house, sex was an unmentionable thing God designed for married men and women only, a word so closeted that the only meaning I could attach to it was darkness. I knew that what happened to the girl in that house was very wrong.</p>
<p>“Why?” I asked my mother. And here, parable gave way to scripture.<em> </em></p>
<p><em>            </em>Asking for it means dressing yourself up in a way that makes men look. And in fact, certain clothes make it impossible for men to stop looking. Nothing like this had ever occurred to me, but now the rules were plain:<br />Thou shalt not sport a low-cut tank top.<br />Or a mini-skirt.<br />A cropped shirt.<br />A tube top.<br />Remember your anatomy, what you risk revealing:<br />Thou shalt not cast a shadow of cleavage, nor a peek of thy midriff, nor a hint of high thigh. </p>
<p>And don’t forget to consider fit. A clingy sweater might show straps, hooks and nipples. A tight skirt might bear witness to underwear. If you don’t obscure your shape, you are a nothing-to-the-imagination, perfect silhouette, shadow, pin-up, playgirl. You might as well be naked.</p>
<p>The lesson continued in Bible studies at home and in church. In 2 Samuel 11:2-5, a beautiful woman bathes nude in a river. She is quiet and alone, but there is David on the roof of his house, with a view. He spies the woman washing, and her nakedness ignites in him a fervent and unruly desire. Since David is king, he sends a servant to fetch her, and once she arrives he lays with her. (The Bible doesn’t say whether or not she said <em>No</em>.) He fathers her child. He murders her husband. It all falls apart for them both. And in this undoing we have a message: in the face of lust, man is both lamb and lion, trailing along after her until his bleating becomes a roar. It is the duty of the woman to watch where she washes.</p>
<p>God commands this, too, in 1 Timothy, a verse that was applied to our middle school lives by many a charismatic youth group leader: “I desire, therefore, that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting; in like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; but, which becometh women professing godliness, with good works.” We examined this verse and listened to the sermons of our pastor, who never continued on to the following lines of Paul’s epistle, because it was the 1990s, I suppose, or because it was already implied: “A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then Eve. And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner.” We nodded and made scrawling notes about modesty and good works in the margins of our KJV Teen Bibles, and I bent my head down low.</p>
<p><em>La Vie en Rose</em></p>
<p>A blood rush. That ruddy-cheeked flush, like a rose fast unfurling, a scarlet bloom below the cheekbones. We blush.</p>
<p>We blush in love, we blush in lust, we blush when we’re nervous or when we’re ashamed. We blush on the spot, when we’re unprepared, mortified or undignified. We blush at first kisses and all through first dates. We blush at flattery, <em>Oh, you do go on. </em>And, oh, don’t we love those blushing brides? Love such sweet, white innocence on the verge of a marriage bed?</p>
<p>But unchaste women of the world, don’t despair. You, too, can achieve this virginal look! Rouge on-demand waits in the form of talc-based powdered blushers, tints and creams that come in every shade on a scale of red: Rose Rebelle, Bronze Sensation, Breath of Plum, Mauve Coquette, Everything’s Rosy, Precious Pink. You can customize your blush.</p>
<p>Some of us blush more than others. Some of us blush at the fact that we’re blushing—a self-conscious circle of life, lived in waves and rushes, a perpetual state of red. Red at work. Red at meetings. Red in bed. Red at touch. Red in the company of strangers. Or crushes. Not green with envy or yellow-bellied or singing the blues, just red.</p>
<p>Blushing originates in the sympathetic nervous system (and since I am a writer and not a biologist, I latch on to the “sympathetic” here, the sweetness and the irony of it). In the network of neurons and ganglia that runs the length of our spinal column, adrenaline pulses, igniting response through fiery synapses—from the Greek <em>syn,</em> “together,” and <em>haptein</em>, “to clasp.” I imagine neurons uniting, clashing and clasping, making microscopic fireworks beneath the skin. In reaction, the blood vessels of the face relax. It’s a vulnerable position. They open up, and blood rushes in.</p>
<p>We understand the anatomical “how”<em> </em>behind this reddest of reactions,<em> </em>but the metaphysical “why” remains puzzling. Every human species, regardless of race or ethnicity, blushes, but we are the only animals to do so, and an evolutionary explanation eludes us. We gave up Neanderthal skulls, jutting jaws and body hair long ago. How has blushing survived the genetic steeplechase?</p>
<p>Research suggests that the blush may be the body’s own built-in response to social cues. In studies led by University of Amsterdam psychologist Corine Dijk, for example, participants more quickly forgave the mistakes of others when the offender blushed. But science has largely overlooked blushing, and findings have done little to advance our understanding of what Darwin, in <em>The Expression of Emotions in Humans and Animals</em>, called “the most peculiar and the most human of all the expressions.” Then and now, the single common denominator in blushing is self-consciousness—the very awareness of our own existence.</p>
<p>Consider the rise and fall of our blushing lives: we begin around kindergarten, when we’re suddenly aware of ourselves in a crowd (“Who told you that you were naked?”); we reach our blushing peak in adolescence, often the height of social anxiety, when our strange, changing bodies feel awkward and mortifying; and blushing tapers as we age, as we become more comfortable in our skins, less chameleon, more self-assured. As Darwin wrote, “Modesty from humility, or from an indelicacy, excites a vivid blush, as both relate to the judgment or fixed customs of others.” Perhaps in maturity, having tried on social norms for size, we are reconciled to the facts of our own bodies, regardless of how they fit.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, the blush takes over. It doesn’t collect in the apples of the cheeks, but spills down the neck, the arms, the torso. There are solutions. Endoscopic Transthoracic Sympathectomy extinguishes the flame with a surgical snip of the sympathetic nerve. It’s a delicate procedure, a risky last resort after medication, hypnosis, and self-help. (For twenty-seven dollars, Gary Ambrosh’s <em>Blushing Free</em> offers a step-by-step cure for “freak show” blushing, available at blushingfree.com, which claims, “You have absolutely nothing to lose here, and EVERYTHING to gain.”)</p>
<p>But didn’t the Bible teach us, somewhere earlier in these pages, that beauty is in the eye of the beholder? (Or was that Maybelline? Or my mother?) My friends with rosacea—that common, flaring redness—are quick to cover their blushing cheeks with their hands, stifling the fire. They forget that the blush, in all its modest innocence, is what charms us. I want to catch that hand mid-reach and watch the blaze, for the rosacea blush is the boldest, the most brazen flush of all. It defies the perimeter of the porcelain doll bloom, the structure of the skull’s zygomatic arch. It sees the apples—forbidden fruit—of the cheeks and refuses to take responsibility for them.</p>
<p>The blush is a match strike. A northern light. A lipstick kiss I want to keep. It comes swift and unexpected. It gives us away. It is blood pulsing, nerves alive, nature red. Primary.</p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p>            Jessie Cameron Allison, my great-grandmother, was a teetotaler, a conservative woman of the early 1900s who exercised restraint in every aspect of her life. Her hair went pure white in her thirties, but it only made her appear more angelic. In the black and white photographs we keep, her hair refracts light into halo.</p>
<p>Music and writing were her passions, but to use the word “passion,” itself a pronouncement of everything loose and unbridled and erupting, seems ill-fitting. She was precise in her arts. She never deviated from the sheet music when she played the pipe organ at church on Sundays. And I doubt that her piano ever sang in syncopation beneath her steady hands—no deliberate disruption of meter, no shift of focus to the offbeat. She respected form. Even her poetry, sweet and songlike, stayed within bounds of structure.</p>
<p>For Great-Grandma Jessie, cosmetics were forbidden. And yet, on her way to an outing, she would pinch at the flesh of her cheekbones just enough to make it flush. In the winter, she would reach for a bit of fresh snow and rub it into her cheeks until her skin went tingly and her brain sent blood rushing to tend and warm. These were the modest girl’s methods of rouging. And I latch on to two notions here: that makeup was sinful to her, but that she allowed herself this small pursuit of its effects; and that beauty, to her, was in the blushing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Makeup is to Minxes :: _____ is to ______ </em></p>
<p>In the fifth grade, my best friend was the new girl in town, come to northern Wisconsin from Shreveport, Louisiana. Louisiana! All the way down on the opposite end of the Mississippi. The boot-shaped state that stood firmly on top of the Gulf, dipped its toe in, looked like it was about to step off the edge altogether. Exotic accents. New Orleans. Baton Rouge.</p>
<p>I liked that she was from the bottom side of the country while I was from the top. I liked that she said “Yes, ma’am,” and, “Yes, sir” in the classroom—and she thought <em>we</em> talked funny—and hollered loud as she wanted on the playground. Unlike other girls I knew, she wasn’t cruel, or quiet, or sweet-as-pie or preachy. She could hit a baseball harder than any of the boys. She could out-cuss them and out-run them, too. She danced the Roger Rabbit and wore her overalls backwards like Kris Kross. She couldn’t believe we’d never heard of them.</p>
<p>She had been held back a year, was what our mothers called an “early bloomer.” While the rest of us were just noticing that we had nipples, she wore a bra every day and more than filled out a B-cup. Occasionally, she wore a swipe of eye shadow that sparkled in the sun or light pink blush on her cheeks. And my eyes went wide one day on the playground when I asked, “What happened to your knee?” And she answered, “Oh. Cut myself shaving. Hurt like heck. But feel ‘em.” I reached down and touched her legs. Silky smooth. Then she made a pose like Superwoman and we raced to the monkey bars, where we hung upside down on the rungs and laughed at each others’ blood-rushed, upside-down faces, and loved<em> </em>the whole upside-down world.</p>
<p>Which is why it struck me when I was over at an old friend’s house, a girl I’d known my whole life, whose mother was a Pentecostal like mine, and her mother stopped our playing to warn us about the new girl. I can still hear her voice as I heard it then, sharp but sing-songy in the warm, familiar kitchen. “You watch out for her, you hear?” She told us. “She’s a little Jezebel, that one. Painted face little Jezebel.…”</p>
<p>Jezebel. The Painted Face. She is, as we’ve defined her, a scheming and shamelessly evil woman. She’s Lolita and Eve. A woman of easy<em> </em>virtue. A temptress, a mistress and a courtesan.</p>
<p>Call her a hussy, hootchie, hooker, whore. Harlot. Jade. Vamp. Vixen. Tart, tease, trollop, tramp. Siren, seductress, strumpet, skank. Coquette, floozy. Wench, hoe. Loose. Slut. Minx.</p>
<p>Find a male equivalent. Look up “gigolo” in your handy thesaurus. Find “playboy,” “socialite,” “pleasure-seeker,” “ladies’ man.” A stud, a player. A father, an uncle. A boy toy. A bachelor. A groom.</p>
<p>By our own definitions, the girl is still, as the Bible commanded her, shamefaced, head bowed low and face aglow with a smolder of scarlet, the harlot’s hue—the sanctioned rouge of disgrace.</p>
<p><em>On Bathing Alone</em></p>
<p>I was a modest child, because I was brought up in a conservative household and I was obedient, and because I never considered my body to be anything but a vehicle for tumbling and speed and power and scrapes until middle school. My younger sister was the exhibitionist. Mom used to have to chase her down and break her will in order to get her to keep her underwear on or to dress herself. She loved to be naked. I liked it, too, in the summertime when I was young. As kids, my sisters and brother and I used to float days away on the lake, naked and swimming, clinging to inner tubes. We’d float idly, or link our tubes together and paddle in trains, feeling the cool water pass through our dog-kicking, chubby little thighs. When summer nights were too hot for sleeping, Mom and Dad would shake all six of us kids from our beds for a late night skinny-dip in the thick, pitch-dark of humid Wisconsin summertime. Caring only for cooling down, Mom and Dad and the rest of us eagerly stripped at the water’s edge, the stars and lightning bugs and moon casting a glow around us, the dock’s tall blue waterslide leaving our bare bottoms pink and tingling from friction and the slippery rush of the ride.</p>
<p>We took baths together as children, sometimes four at a time. This ended, naturally, as we each gradually outgrew the confines of our standard-sized bathtub. I feel like it must have been significant at the time: an older sibling suddenly missing from bath time, having graduated to the solo shower. First Josie. Then Alan. Then me, leaving Bethye to the bathtub, alone.</p>
<p>But I don’t remember leaving her, and I don’t remember the first time I showered by myself. Funny, how a girl spends a lifetime of seven or eight years bathing with siblings and showering with parents, and suddenly she’s standing alone in that wide expanse of the tub, water storming down, and no one to wash the soap out of her hair. No sister to scrub her back. Maybe it was liberating, one giant step closer to Big Kid. Maybe it was frightening and lonely and I wanted it to be over as fast as could be. Either way, the significance of such a moment seems great—profound, even. I don’t know how I lost it.</p>
<p>And I wonder, is this when we started hiding, when we started closing ourselves off to one another? One minute, siblings are naked, swimming like a school of giddy minnows; the next, they’re yelling at each other for barging into the bathroom without knocking first. When did we stop thinking of our bodies as limbs and muscle—all the tools we needed for cartwheels, tree climbs, and monkey bars—and start thinking of them as dark secrets for keeping? At some point, we started taking them seriously, and became shamefaced in one another’s sight.</p>
<p><em>Asking for It: Reprise</em></p>
<p>I often feel bewildered by my adult body. It’s a feeling like I’ve misplaced something I just set down, or like I’ve walked into a room and forgotten why I intended to go there in the first place. Sometimes I spy my body in the mirror and am surprised by what I see. Breasts, for one thing. Somehow I go about my days forgetting that my body looks any different than it did when I was twelve, and it startles me to see them there, to see curves in place of the angles and lines. I forget until I catch my reflection in a windowpane, or until I try to swing a golf club or go for a run, and these two fatty, fibrous mounds—soft and workable to an extent, but nonetheless fixed—get in my way. Over the years, I’ve gotten used to the feeling of a bra, even the underwire. As long as the straps aren’t loose and everything’s in the right place, I can forget that I’m wearing it completely—until I undress, and my body remembers what it feels like to be loose, and it’s like an unshackling.</p>
<p>In my father’s house of five daughters, many arguments took place over bra straps and cleavage—and nipples, when we tried to get away with no bra for a day. One day of freedom. I remember getting ready to leave the house for a high school dance. I was fourteen, a freshman, and I was wearing a dress that just one year earlier would have gone unnoticed: a burgundy knee-length with thick white ribbon around the empire waist, a squared neckline and white straps. It was modest, really. I wore heels. A white mohair cardigan with pearl buttons covered my shoulders. I looked in the mirror feeling grown-up and pleased.</p>
<p>When I heard my ride pull into the driveway, I made my way downstairs, stopping in the kitchen to kiss my parents’ cheeks and ask, <em>How do I look? </em>My mother nodded approvingly. But my father said nothing. Silence. He averted his eyes. And then he started singing to the tune from <em>Carousel</em>, “She…was busting out all over!”</p>
<p>The shackles tightened. My cheeks burned. He said, <em>Better keep that sweater buttoned.</em></p>
<p>Tears fell, because here, all this time, I thought I was dressed, but it turned out I was naked, and even there, in the easy comfort of home, surrounded by family, by my own father, I was mortified.</p>
<p>As I walked in silence to the door, I heard a voice. <em>Girl</em>, the world said, <em>you are guilty of a B cup</em>. Think of the untamed hormones of adolescent boys! Think of what your body might incite in another! Think of your rounding curves, of Jezebel’s end, of all the gods in all the heavens who command you to cover up. Ask yourself, “What would my father say?”</p>
<p>And I understood then that no matter how many layers I wore, or how much concealer I used to mask the red, or how privately I bathed, it would never be enough. I would always be naked.</p>
<p>I lifted my chin. I let my shame turn to quiet rage. For the first time, I left my parents without saying goodbye.</p>
<p>You girls in grey houses, you Louisiana girls, early bloomer girls who bathe nude in the river or the lake, you know your lines. You will bite through the ripe red skin of an apple, through the flesh, to the core. You will wear your hair long, tuck it beneath a veil, let that be your immodesty, the one thing you will never tame. You will reach for a red dress, because you like the color and because the skirt is loose and full and makes you think of swimming naked, of burden lifted. It’s what’s on the outside that everyone notices, but on the inside, you will rage.</p>
<p>I rage at the veil. I rage at the gaze. I rage at the ogling of construction workers on lunch breaks, when a girl has no choice but the sidewalk before them to take. I rage at <em>she must be silent </em>and <em>it was she who became a sinner.</em></p>
<p>I rage at the one who takes, who wrecks, even after the word <em>No.</em> And I rage at the silence we expect will follow, the blame we place, the shame.</p>
<p>I rage, and still, in the mornings before school and work, I wake up and remember that I must arrange myself correctly. Is this blouse too clingy? Is the neckline too low? I remember my duty, that the difference between a red dress and a black sweater set is biblical. I remember my body, that once I get to work I have to be careful about leaning on desks or crossing my arms or bending at the waist. I remember that without even intending to, I could be asking for it.</p>
<p>I remember, too, rehearsing for a college theater department’s production of <em>Hair</em>, a musical of defiance. In preparation for the show, I<em> </em>spent months singing the protest songs of my parents’ generation—songs my pious parents never sang themselves—and growing my dirty-blonde hair as long as I could. I let my waves go wild, wanted a shock of hair, for this was the shape protest took during Vietnam, when a soldier’s hairstyle and sexuality were clear-cut. And when the time came and the chanting swelled and the character I played couldn’t bear the weight of the war and the world anymore, she stood up, lifted her bowed head high, and dropped the veil.</p>
<p>Our clothes landed in uneven piles on the stage, and the lights went up, hot and white. To the audience, the ones who did not avert their eyes, we were a blur of skin in varying shades, and I was just one of a number of bodies—not men, not women, not blushing or sexy, just bodies—a mass of unruly hair and immodesty, all of us naked and no one ashamed.</p>
<p>It was the briefest of moments before the curtain fell, but I remember it as pure sublime beneath those haloed lights, to not just act a part or be loved for my parts, but to be, simply, a part—to feel genderless, not threatening or threatened, to be cast into the world and not cast out. Or, to be cast out in the sense of a fisherman’s net, which is a kept thing until it unfurls loosely, gloriously, in midair before disappearing into the wild waves, far from shore where the children swim safely, unabashedly naked.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No one knows when or why humans first danced.  The original dancers may have danced to display their fitness to the opposite sex, please or appease the gods, or act out a spontaneous fit of ecstasy, but these are just speculations about a mystery—the secret of the music that beckons us, the rhythms that propel us.  Fossils give us clues about the origin of bipedalism and the ability to jump or bend or spin, but the actual movements of a body have never been fossilized.  From as far back as 3300 B.C. we have images of dancers in Indian paintings and Egyptian tombs, but we can’t say when dance became part of human culture.</p>
<p>We also don’t know when birds first danced.  Did they evolve from dancing reptiles?  It’s a whimsical question perhaps, but one we won’t answer.  We do know that many human dances—raven and oystercatcher dances of Native Americans, <em>Swan Lake</em>, the Funky Chicken—mimic bird movements.  An Australian myth tells the story of Brolga, her tribe’s most joyful girl and most innovative dancer, who attracted many suitors but rejected them all.  One reject, an evil magician, decided that if he couldn’t have Brolga, no one else would, and so he transformed her.  When her tribe went looking for her, they found instead a tall, graceful bird engaged in a beautiful, intricate dance.  The crane we now call Brolga still dances in the Australian grasslands, with bows, dips and leaps that have inspired generations of human dancers.</p>
<p>What constitutes a dance is problematic.  To dance, according to one definition, is “to move rhythmically, usually to music, using prescribed or improvised steps and gestures,” but the judgment of whether a given movement is “rhythmic” can be highly subjective.  I recall the dancing of a girlfriend in college.  She kept moving to be sure, with fervent spasms that created a kind of pattern, but the beats that drove her were entirely internal or at least had no apparent correlation to the music.  Dance critic Julie van Kamp notes the “puzzling borderline phenomena” that can make it hard to tell a dance from a non-dance.  Birds, like humans, may dance to a music of their own, with rhythms we can’t readily detect or measure.</p>
<p>It can also be difficult to distinguish between a dance and a “display,” a term that, in reference to birds, includes movements commonly called “dances” but is used more broadly to denote any innate, ritualized visual signal.  A bird dance, like other displays, is both communication and strategic stimulation.  The neck retractions, pouch inflations, sky pointing, and aerial tumbling of various birds are messages delivered to elicit specific responses in the recipients.  The body, human or avian, has its own language, and dance may convey the message with an urgency and clarity that no vocalization alone, including words, could achieve.  Dancing birds may create a music of sorts—calls, squeaks, screams&#8211;but only a few birds, such as the northern mockingbird, literally “sing” as they dance.  It’s no mean feat for any animal to vocalize with complexity while caught up in energetic, elaborate movement, innate or not.</p>
<p>As with humans, birds have a repertoire of dances for various occasions, including courtship dances, “war” or at least threat dances, and the “triumph ceremonies” of geese, likened by Konrad Lorenz to “militant enthusiasm in man” and akin to the choreographed gloating celebrations of NFL wide receivers.  While the threat postures of birds certainly appear hostile, they are generally used to defuse, not escalate potential conflict.  Often the threat is a bluff, and few bird disputes result in actual combat.   In <em>On Aggression</em>, Lorenz interprets the seemingly belligerent “appeasement ceremony” of a crane as the crane’s way of “expressing in easily understood symbolism that his threat of attack is emphatically not directed against his partner but, on the contrary, away from him, against the wicked world outside, implying in this manner the motive of comradely defense.”  Birds may dance to set themselves apart, in defense of territory or in advertisement of their superiority over their rivals, or, like courting terns and appeasing cranes, they may dance to bind themselves together.</p>
<p>It’s the courtship rituals of birds that seem most dance-like to humans, while the stereotyped movements of threat and defense, though often quite intricate, seem to test the boundary between dance and display.  In defense of its territory, a bird may crouch, hiss, sway, flap its wings, jerk its tail, compress or puff up its feathers, assume attack positions, and then leap forward.  Is this dancing?  Yet even in courtship dances, the movements may convey both desire and danger, seduction and joust.  Birds, it’s been said, are lovers, not fighters, but they may be both at the same time.  As Chris Leahy explains in <em>The Birdwatcher’s Companion</em>, one theory is that avian courtship displays “have evolved out of half-realized movements made by birds in ambivalent situations”—ambivalence, that is, “between attraction to a potential mate and aggression toward a potential rival.”  A dance, Leahy says, may include “displacement activities,” such as preening or presenting nest material, “that over time have become integrated into the courtship ceremony.”  What seems like a ballet of pure arousal might better be described as a channeling of potentially destructive energy, a means of conflict resolution, or a dance that answers a question.  Fight, flee, or mate?  Not that human dancing is so different.  Watch a show like <em>So You Think You Can Dance </em>and you’ll be struck by how many dances, especially contemporary dances, enact a drama of attraction, retreat, and reconciliation, or the failure of reconciliation.  Perhaps the dancing of my arhythmic college girlfriend befuddled me because I couldn’t decipher her intent.  Was she advancing, retreating, provoking, or merely oblivious?  Should I fight, flee, or mate?  Sometimes a dance answers the question.  Sometimes it amplifies the ambivalence.</p>
<p>Which bird species are the best dancers?  It is, presumably, a purely human question.  Courting birds may want to out-compete their same-species rivals, but they rarely show interest in the mating antics of other species.  Nonetheless, it would be entertaining to stage an all-bird <em>So You Think You Can Dance</em> with contestants from avian families around the world.  Of course the celebrities—that is, birds celebrated by people&#8211;would have to be invited.  There’s Snowball, the head-bopping, crest-flaring sulphur-crested cockatoo whose You Tube dances to human songs, those of the Backstreet Boys in particular, have led researchers to theorize that the ability to keep a beat is found only in birds, mainly parrots, with the capacity to imitate sound.  Another popular You Tube video stars an unnamed red-capped manakin sliding backwards along a branch, with a Michael Jackson soundtrack and a dancing woman who demonstrates how to imitate the manakin moonwalk.  Fifteen more potential contestants can be found on “These Birds Can Dance,” a video collection of “titillating mating dances” by wide-ranging species including the blue-footed booby, Gouldian finch, ostrich, Clark’s grebe, and superb bird-of-paradise.</p>
<p>Different bird species have traditions of both song and dance, with regional variations or a talent for mimicry that indicate what biologists call “neural plasticity,” but their approaches to dance cannot be categorized into well-defined styles such as those used in standard ballroom competitions—waltz, Latin, quick step.  However, it would probably make sense to split any dancing bird competitors into two basic groups, the couples’ dancers and lek dancers.  In lekking species, which come from fourteen families of birds worldwide, the males gather in a group to perform complex dances in a display arena, or lek, a word derived from the Swedish <em>leka</em>, or sex play.  The females don’t dance but watch, judging, until one by one they select what they consider the most impressive dancing male.  “For the male,” says Edward O. Wilson in his description of a sharp-tailed grouse lek, “everything turns on prowess on the display ground.”  In <em>The Sibley Guide to Bird Life and Behavior, </em>David Sibley notes that male success is “extremely variable among members of a lek,” a way of saying that when it comes to the goal of the dance—consummation—most participants are out of luck.  Lekking tends to be a winner-take-all proposition.  Males feud to gain and hold the best display territories, and often the vast majority of females will choose the same mate.  The losers may gain a revenge of sorts.  “Failure to consummate copulations because of disruption,” says ornithologist Frank Gill, “is one of the major liabilities of joining an aggregation of eager males.”  In contrast to the picky females, lekking males show “little selectivity,” to use Sibley’s phrase, in choosing partners.  They will mate with any and all comers&#8211;a point which human females may consider proof of a general tendency in the male animal.  Further proof may be found in the fact that sperm is the lekking male’s only contribution to parenting.  Females of these species raise their offspring without male assistance.</p>
<p>Lekking was among the phenomena that led Charles Darwin to the idea of sexual selection: the theory that features such as brilliant colors, lavish plumage, and dramatic displays have evolved not because they are useful in survival but because female birds, and females of some other species, have favored these features in selecting mates.  “To suppose that the females do not appreciate the beauty of the males,” Darwin wrote, “is to admit that their splendid decorations, all their pomp and display, are useless; and this is incredible.”  The theory was long resisted by various critics, some feeling that it disparaged females as frivolous, others contending that it granted too much evolutionary weight to female “caprice.”  How, the critics asked, can a mere dance convey a bird’s genetic fitness?  How can otherwise sensible females be taken in by pompous, puffed-up males who are just showing off?  Are female birds aesthetes, loving beauty for beauty’s sake, even though their preferences may lead to the evolution of features, like the peacock’s tail, longer and longer with each generation, that might handicap their offspring in escaping from predators?  Current explanations of female choice, as summarized by Helena Cronin in <em>The Ant and the Peacock</em>, range from the theory of “runaway” female taste—fashion preferences escalating out of control&#8211;to the claim that lekking dance marathons do in fact proclaim genetic fitness by giving proof of endurance and the ability to dominate rivals.</p>
<p>Studies of leks have also contributed to theories about the relation between sound and movement in birds and the origins of cooperative behavior.  For instance, one oddity of some dancing manakin species, like the swallow-tailed manakin, is that a dominant male will be joined by helper males, who play back-up to his lead, with coordinated team jumps, until they eventually bow out of the dance, before copulation.  What’s in it for them?  Are they just biding their time?  The answer may help to explain one of the great mysteries of biology, the evolution of altruism.  In <em>The Singing Life of Birds</em>, Donald Kroodsma observes that among hummingbirds, and perhaps cotingas, the ability to “learn” songs—rather than produce song without going through a learning stage&#8211;has been documented only in species that lek.  The ability of birds to dance in a certain way—in a lek or, like Snowball, in time with human-generated rhythms—may provide clues not only about the development of avian brain systems for learning song but also about the evolution of human dialects and language itself.</p>
<p>Lekking birds tend to be great dancers, almost by definition, but any selection of competitors could not leave out the Andean cock-of-the-rock, from the cotinga family of South and Central America.  Slightly larger than an American robin, this outlandish creature is a day-glo reddish orange, with a body that seems to merge with its head, intense yellow eyes placed high on the side of the head, and a puffy frontal fan that often covers its beak and makes the bird appear mouth-less as well as neck-less.  Its dance, performed mornings and afternoons for weeks on end during the breeding season, consists of bows, head bobs, push-ups, profile poses, and 180 degree about-face spins, accompanied by clucks and harsh, nasal squawks.  Rival males squabble, guard their ground, and interfere with one another as the drabber brown females approach and the dance grows more frantic.  Sometimes copulation is preceded by a chase—a flaming orange male jetting through a ravine in pursuit of a mate.</p>
<p>Our contestants would also have to include a few members of the manakin family, though the choice seems arbitrary, dependent on one’s taste in manakin dance styles.  One personal favorite is the long-tailed manakin of Costa Rica, a tiny black bird with a scarlet crown patch, sky blue back, and streaming tail feathers the length of its torso.  Its dance combines explosive wing snaps and “to-le-do” calls with pinwheel spins, butterfly flutters, feather puffing, and ricocheting leapfrog hops.  Other manakin dancers will hang upside down, moonwalk, slide down branches firefighter-style, or tempt females with quick, subtle tactile stimulation.  In some species, duos and trios will practice without females present.  The climax of a manakin dance, copulation, is often so brief that humans need slow-motion film to witness it.</p>
<p>Among North American species, the most renowned lek dancers belong to the grouse family.  The multi-media display of the greater sage-grouse mixes wing swishes and loud, popping vocals with plumage ruffling and an enormous inflation of its brilliant white breast and throat.  Its cousin, the sharp-tailed grouse, the Energizer Bunny of the Western prairie, inflates its purple neck sac and skitters helter-skelter like a wind-up toy run amok, with occasional breaks to beat its rivals with its wings or pull out their feathers.  The greater prairie-chicken, whose scientific name roughly translates as “drumming love-god chicken,” also skitters, leaps, and struts while blowing air out of its esophageal sac to produce a resonant “boom” that demonstrates why a lekking arena is sometimes called a booming ground.  Christopher Cokinos describes the prairie-chickens as “the professional wrestlers of the bird realm.”  Like other lekkers, they will assume threat postures and skirmish with adversaries, but they “prefer choreography to harm.”</p>
<p>Lekking species include some of the avian world’s most frenzied, flamboyant dancers, but, from a human perspective, their dancing may not offer much sense of the romance, or kind concern, that we associate with the term “pair-bonding.”  To the extent that there is any human equivalent, a lek is the crudest of singles’ bars, all show and cut to the chase, without the conversational gambits or slightest pretense of commitment.  We are not a lekking species, Matt Ridley says in <em>The Red Queen</em>, but are “more like terns, who choose mates that can fish well, than sage-grouse hens, who copy one another’s choice of a fast-displaying male.”  With avian couples’ dancers it’s easier to be anthropomorphic, attributing romance to the dance, though, as Chris Leahy points, the “displays of affection” in a bonding pair of birds “may lack the emotional depth imputed to them by some humans.”  Few birds literally mate for life, and couples’ dances often incorporate practical elements suggesting that, in seeking Mr. Right, females want a good provider, at least for that breeding season.  Courting terns, for instance, may sway, plunge, or bank together in the air, all in apparent ecstasy, but, as Ridley notes, the male will also offer the female a fish to provide proof of his usefulness.</p>
<p>In judging the quality of couples’ dances, a fair contest might divide the contestants according to where they dance: on land, in the water, and in the air.  (We might also need a special category for the gender-bending dances of polyandrous species, like phalaropes and jacanas, in which the traditional male/female roles of dancer and judge are reversed.)  For the land dancers’ competition, one good prospect would be the “beep-beep” greater roadrunner, from the deserts of Mexico and the southwestern United States.  The male runs, prances, pops his wings, fans his tail.  Male and female chase each other, often pacing the dance with an interlude to enjoy a dust bath together.  In copulation, the male may mount the female with a mouse in his mouth, a post-coital gift before he sprints off.</p>
<p>Another personal favorite is the black-capped donacobius of the Amazonian basin, a handsome black-and-tan species with its own genus, neither wren nor thrush nor mockingbird but reminiscent of all three.  The day we found the birds—a pair—my wife and I, with six other birders, were waiting out a sudden downpour, huddled on a small, soggy island in the shack of a kindly local farmer.  They were perched close atop a bush, the donacobius couple, courting in an antiphonal duet—singing, Gene Kelly-like, in the rain.  Back and forth they sang and swayed, twisting and turning to the rhythms of Brazilian rain, with the tight synchronization of champion samba partners.  We couldn’t help but dance with them.</p>
<p>Among the water dancers, we’d need at least one representative of the grebe family, perhaps the great crested grebe of Eurasia and Africa.  A grebe couples’ dance intertwines solo virtuosity with tightly synchronized tandem tableaux.  The male crouches, in exaggerated mimicry of a cat about to pounce.  Male and female join in a “penguin dance,” in which they seem to stand together in the water.  They shake their heads, exchange gifts of weedy vegetation, and then face each other in a perfect mirror image.</p>
<p>As for the air dancers, well, I’m sorry, but I’ve already decided on the victor.  It has to be some species of hummingbird.  Other bird families may move nicely through space, circling, gliding, swooping, but it’s hard to beat a bird that can do it all, and do it ten times faster—oscillating, bee-zipping, helicoptering up, backwards and sideways, inscribing the air with arcs and loop-the-loops while its heart beats 20 times a second.  From the perspective of wing-less, earthbound humans, air-dancing might seem to stretch the definition of what could reasonably be called dance, but we should remember that many human dance “steps” have been inspired by flight-envy.  The dance of any animal is constrained and to some extent dictated by the animal’s anatomy, the capacity of its body to move this way but not that way.  Some birds, like grebes and hummingbirds, can barely walk on ground, much less dance.  To dance with jazz hands, one needs hands.</p>
<p>Unlike humans, birds don’t choose to dance, or not dance.  Some families, like Western Hemisphere tanagers and wood warblers, perform displays that could scarcely be called dances—maybe a bit of unpretentious hopping, with sound effects&#8211; but seem to rely instead on gorgeous plumage to attract mates.  Others, like some relatively drab wrens and thrushes, neither dance nor flash eye-popping colors but woo mainly through enticing serenades.  But for those birds that must dance, the stakes are high, and bad dancing spells disaster, at least in the Darwinian sense of reproductive success.  People also dance to show our sexual stuff, just as we sing and dress for success, but for us the reproductive pressure to dance well is much weaker.  The arrhythmic among us can compensate in other ways, like words, to display our fitness for the mating game.</p>
<p>The most celebrated human dancers have often been the innovators, from the pioneers of modern dance to the perpetrators of popular dance crazes, like Chubby Checker and the Twist.  The instinctive basis of bird dancing suggests that birds lack our ability to innovate, but we don’t know that for sure.  The origins of animal courtship rituals are lost in evolutionary time, but all extant birds have evolved from some common ancestor, and over millions of years they have managed to come up with an astonishing array of dance maneuvers.  Along the way, individual birds must have performed a succession or combination of moves never before attempted.  Others may have mimicked them and set a trend, the avian equivalent of the Macarena.  There’s the Manakin Moonwalk, the Hummingbird Helicopter, the Woodcock Whistling Twitter.  To know whether birds ever experiment with dance styles, we’d have to observe a great number of them, from a wide variety of families, as they dance their lives away&#8211;a daunting task, especially given that some bird families, like nightjars, do their dancing in the dark.  For birds it takes at least two to tango, and, as far as I know, there’s no evidence that birds ever dance alone, for the sheer joy of it, but we can’t rule out the possibility.  In her discussion of the purposes of play, Natalie Angier says, “Nothing in nature arises because it is fun, although much that we need to do ends up feeling so good that we’re inspired to keep doing it.”</p>
<p>In <em>Biophilia, </em>Edward O. Wilson claims that scientists will eventually be able to explain the exact process by which neurons produce the electric commands that culminate in the courtship dances of birds-of-paradise.  He worries that such an explanation will be “turned into a metaphor of what humanists dislike most about science: that it reduces nature and is insensitive to art.”  His worry, I think, is unfounded.  We may someday grasp the neural basis and mechanics of bird dance, but we will still be left with the mystery of why birds, and humans, are driven to dance in the first place.  “As played out in birds,” John Hay writes in <em>The Way to the Salt Marsh, </em>“the planetary rhythms have a supremacy which cannot be violated or reduced.”  Science, including the theories of evolutionary biology, will never fully answer the questions posed by the arts—why Frankenstein is drawn to music, why men are entranced by the dancing of women well past their child-bearing years, or why Franz Kafka, after a long struggle and in apparent defiance of a genetic mandate, chose to forego reproduction and dedicate his life to telling stories.</p>
<p>An old joke asks the question: “Why don’t Baptists have sex?”  The answer: “Because it might look like they’re dancing.”  Dancing birds are not oblivious to the critical judgments of their observers—males on a lek certainly seek signs that the females approve—but as far as we can tell, they aren’t troubled by self-consciousness about the moral or aesthetic qualities of their performance.  They might miss out on the pleasure of self-admiration experienced by a juvenile human male as he struts and prances while playing air guitar in the mirror, but they’re also spared the worrisome question that might keep this boy off the dance floor at his prom: Do I dance like a dork?</p>

<p>1</p>
<p><em>The dozen fetuses of the sand shark feed on each other<br /> until only one is left to be born.<br /> </em></p>
<p>When I visit, my father, nearing ninety, sings hymns aloud, tells me he wakes each morning expecting to be reborn, repeating it three times as if I’m the genie for resurrection.  He says he hears the brothers I never had softly talking in the small bedroom where I slept while not one of them was born. They whisper, he says, about the way he refused them, saying “never” in the disciplined sign language of the rhythm method, keeping each of them a jealous spirit.</p>
<p>When he sings “In the Garden,“ I imagine those brothers, each day, rising to where my childhood window looks out at the rhododendron roof-high, the peace of its curtain, fragments of light that testify like character witnesses for weather.  They move their mouths to those hymns that are heavy with sunrise and eternal joy.</p>
<p>Now, in October, the house holds the early darkness and the dry heat of the furnace, and my father repeats the chorus, raising his voice to be heard by those unborn boys who wake him each morning like birds.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>One of my students tells me she devoured her twin in the womb, a doctor solving that natural crime with the spaced clues of ultrasound.  “My mother explained it all to me,” she says.  “She gave me a copy of the ultrasound photograph that was taken when there were two of us.”</p>
<p>She confides that she keeps her shadow twin sealed inside a scrapbook she opens on her birthday, leaving the photo face up in her bedroom.  For when, she says, her family sings around her cake.  For when their voices swell enough to reach her sister.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>On my next visit, I bring my father a gift, a book that traces the stories behind the composition of more than fifty selected hymns.  The words and music for all of the hymns are included, and the book, with its dark, austere cover, has the feel of church about it, as if I should rise from my chair as he opens it, ready to join in singing the processional.</p>
<p>It’s been fifteen years since he lost the glasses my mother made him get in order to be able to read any print smaller than headlines.  He squints at a few pages, pauses at those which have the hymns printed on them to read the titles that are printed in the large, Old English Text font of the Lutheran hymnal he’s sung from for more than eighty years.  Finally, he closes his eyes, one hand resting across a page, and begins to sing “The Old Rugged Cross.”</p>
<p>4</p>
<p><em>            Astronomers now believe Earth once had three moons—News Item</em></p>
<p>If we are outside at night when I spend a day or two at his house, my father tells me to look up while he points out sets of stars he sees in the shapes of animals, objects, or people.  He points out glowing dots that are planets, and though most of the time I fail to distinguish what he identifies, I keep my nearsighted eyes lifted to please him.   During a winter visit, the evening surprisingly warm, I tell him there used to be three moons, announcing it as if that number had been proved.  “They were either sucked into the sun or broken to bits by the one moon that’s left,” I say, and he nods.</p>
<p>For a moment I think that he’s somehow already heard about this theory, but when he says, “Yes, that’s a new moon,” I understand he hasn’t heard me clearly, picking out “moon” from the sound jumble created by his near deafness and guessing what a novice sky watcher might offer.</p>
<p>“There used to be three moons,” I say again.  “Somebody probably stood here like us and thought they looked like three beautiful sisters thrown into the sky by some jealous god.”</p>
<p>My father nods again.  He says “Good.”</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Once, in Africa, boys ran to their teacher to tell how their friend had accepted candy from a stranger’s hand and turned into a yam.  “There,” they said, “see what’s left?” and that teacher carried the yam to the police with care.</p>
<p>For three days, nearby, a girl’s been missing, turned into nothing but a column of cars outside our schools, mothers in silent bunches, buses that transport epidemic numbers, their red seats emptied by the virus of fear.  Stories are told about girls vanished like time, yet returning like swallows.</p>
<p>The police, in Africa, displayed that yam and people flocked to see.  Mothers from nearby villages worshipped the hope of metamorphosis, how their lost children might have been left uneaten by some candied stranger.  If only they’d been transformed into things with voices; if only they could identify themselves, prove they were within some object to be kept and cared for.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>I take my father to dinner, eating in a restaurant so familiar he can order what he’s had three times before without having to read the menu.  On the way back to his house he asks me to park on Butler Street for the first time in nearly twenty years.  The street is so deserted, there is room for ten cars, but I know to drift up to where a vacant lot sits among the buildings that house bars, a beauty shop, a tattoo parlor, and a long-closed hardware store that still sports its name on the side of the building.  He uses his cane to shuffle into the middle of that empty space where the bakery he owned for sixteen years used to stand.</p>
<p>“The bakery’s been missing so long, pretty soon no one will know it was here,” he says.</p>
<p>“Probably,” I say, an easy agreement.  It’s been thirty-three years since the building was torn down a few months after the bakery closed.  Shortly afterwards, the cement we’re standing on was laid over the vacant space to provide parking for people who rented the rooms above those nearby businesses, though now, when I glance up, I can’t see any lights in the upstairs rooms on either side of us and no cars are parked near where we stand.</p>
<p>I half expect him to begin a hymn, but instead he leans on his cane and says, “The house where I was born is gone, and the house where you were born is gone,” sounding so mournful I offer to drive him to both sites, one leveled to make room for a widened highway, the other long ago razed and replaced by a church.  With the sound of traffic passing, he seems to hear nothing of what I say.</p>
<p>“Right here,” he says, and when he spreads his arms, I guess that he’s standing at the memory of work-bench, that when he pulls his hands back together and lifts them , the cane dangling from his right hand, he is ready to carry something to the bank of ovens in the nearby remembered room.</p>
<p>After a few seconds he lowers his hands, steadies himself, and asks me to stand closer.  He tells me my mother is slicing bread, the cash register behind her, the three of us working together because he is icing a wedding cake just before delivery, spiraling sweetness so thick with sugar and lard around the figures of the bride and groom, no one should eat it, trusting me to balance the three white tiers to the car.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Vanishing twins may occur in as many as one of every eight multifetus pregnancies and may not even be known in most cases.  In one study, only three of twenty-one pairs of twins survived to term, suggesting intense fetal competition for space and nutrition  In some instances vanishing twins leave no detectable trace at birth.  More than one amniotic sac can be seen in early pregnancy.  A few weeks later only one.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Because his house becomes so dusty, I suffer asthma attacks during two consecutive visits.  The next time I arrive, I tell him that I have other business the following day, that I have a reservation sixty miles away in order to be closer to my morning appointment.</p>
<p>And that’s mostly true.  I drive for an hour and stay in a motel along the highway I use to return home. It’s one hour cut from the four hour drive, and I’ve stayed late enough that the trip wouldn’t have ended until after one a.m.</p>
<p>The motel room is clean and free of dust.  I watch the late news and sports on the Pittsburgh channel that my father watches each night before he hobbles, bracing himself on furniture and the walls of his hall before lying down in the bed I slept in for thirteen years.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>I  mention to the student who absorbed her twin that my daughter sent me ultrasound photos of both of her yet-to-be-born.  That I stuck those photos among cards and snapshots and short lists of things-to-do on my refrigerator, not telling her my daughter asked not to know their sex, her daughters old enough, now, to study their early selves like scholars of pre-birth.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Transformations fill the museum I imagine for the missing—a lunch box, a ribbon, a mitten, one untied shoe. A boy become a newspaper satchel, a girl turned into an emptied purse. When I think of the nearby missing girl I imagine leaves on the tongue, mud in the eyes, the sound of weeping  stifled by blood in the throat.</p>
<p>The morning of the first milk carton child&#8211;Etan Patz, six years old and vanished&#8211;my own three children, ages two to seven, ate breakfast as if they were promises waiting for a kiss to revive them.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>At eighty-nine, my father gives up his cane for a walker.  Because he is embarrassed by his weakness, I have to convince him to go to the familiar restaurant.  I park by the front door and leave the car running while I help him stand.  I unfold the walker and set it up for him, telling him to go inside while I park the car.</p>
<p>When I return he hasn’t moved.  During dinner he says, without any prompting, “When you have just one son, there’s no room for anything terrible to happen.”</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>My daughter has painted a sky of chairs that sparkle like redundant constellations. Her heaven is moonless, the chairs, she says, ascending.  The sky bleeds from one side from the wounds she imagines on an adjacent panel, one that waits nearby, brilliant with light.  Her two daughters, ages seven and four, dream of painting it blue, a sun shining the chairs invisible.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>The vanished twin can die from a poorly implanted placenta, a developmental anomaly that causes major organs to fail or to be completely missing, or there may be a chromosome abnormality incompatible with life.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>During the three-moon era it would have been possible to simultaneously witness the crescent moon of anticipation, the half moon of mercy, and the full moon of joy.</p>
<p>Or some other arrangement of emotions for those triplets.  Or some extraordinary apprehension if, one night, all three lay below the horizon.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>After my father, a month into living at a nursing home, acquiesces to a wheelchair, he lasts six weeks before he dies. My sister, a church choir director, keeps the book of hymns.</p>
<p>I make sure my last two visits to his house are as short as possible, the asthma attack-inducing dust an issue in every room.  What I want most are photographs, especially those that help to deny the <em>never </em>of what is irretrievable.</p>
<p>I spend half of that time in my old room rummaging in boxes from department stores that closed decades ago.  Inside one from Horne’s are photos so unfamiliar that I barely recognize myself from ages six to eleven.  After I look at others in the box I can tell that the photographs were taken by an uncle, that they were stored in my bedroom closet after both he and my aunt had died.</p>
<p>My father, about ten years earlier, had claimed all of them from another empty house.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p><em> Never</em> arrived with his flashlight, and people in the next town followed it to the river and the woods and the damp basements of a half-constructed houses.  Those search parties, on the fifth day of looking for the missing girl, dwindled from “rescue” to “recovery,” and yet nothing was found.</p>

<p>Today I wake with the coffee maker set to six a.m., its cough driving me out of sleep like a smoke alarm.  Now, when I talk to the air, somebody is there.  This morning three birds fly into the living room windows, one of them dead in the iris, the other two missing.  A neighbor says it’s three flights of the same bird, but I remember the music of those thumps, the variation of size and speed, and I see the colors of the missing above the trees, shades necessary as water as I stand beneath them, my face upturned to spaces they have left in the sky.</p>
