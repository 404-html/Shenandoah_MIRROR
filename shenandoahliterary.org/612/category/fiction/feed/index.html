								<content:encoded><![CDATA[[audio:http://shenandoahliterary.org/612/files/2011/08/Real-Cowboy-Sappenfield.mp3|titles=Real Cowboy]
<p>He’s a muscular angle against the barn door’s frame. His back and one leg are straight. His other leg is bent, bootheel pressed against wood. Though his eyes are in a wedge of shade beneath his hat, he squints across the pasture, the arena, and the pine forest rising on the mountain. He smokes his cigarette like breathing, not even a pause when he places it at his lips, and he’s careful to flick the ashes into the dirt. His name is Lloyd. He arrived at this Colorado ranch a month ago, and, other than the Idaho license plate on his Chevy truck, that’s all I know.</p>
<p>His profile ignites me. I catch myself staring, and I know Lloyd feels my eyes. I flush. I weave the red prongs of the apple-picker through the straw and empty the manure into the almost-full wheelbarrow blocking the stall’s gate. Ibn Soldad, the million-dollar stallion who produced this poop, whinnies to the mares from the lunging ring. It’s his favorite hour, the time when John strolls to the pasture, halters a mare, and brings her to him.</p>
<p>I roll the wheelbarrow out the barn door into the sun and smell blazing dirt. I’ve been doing this for a month, but I strain against the weight. I’m tall for fourteen, but new bra and all, I probably still weigh less than the wheelbarrow’s load. John, who owns this ranch, gets a kick out of my determination. Last week, Andrea, his wife, gave me a belt with a platter-size silver buckle etched with flowers. “For your hard work,” she said. Even though it pokes my stomach when I bend, I wear it every day. It’s not hard to be good around here. Andrea feeds me three meals a day, and her and John’s moods are as constant as the sunrise, which I’ve seen a lot lately.</p>
<p>When I pass the lunging ring, Lloyd holds a halter rope with the white stallion roiling at the end. Mane and tail churn the air. John leads Cammy, a bay mare, hauled here all the way from Montana, toward the gate. It’s like Lloyd holds a storm, and his velvet murmurs soothe lightning. I strain to feel his words over the squeaking wheelbarrow. I imagine them spoken to me. The tops of my thighs tingle. I clench the handles, hold my back rigid, and find strength in my legs.</p>
<p>The manure spreader is a buckboard wagon with a metal barrel across the back that sends shit flying over the pastures as it’s pulled behind a truck. Last week, I learned to drive. This week, John says he’ll teach me to tow the spreader. I shovel in the new poop, lifting it high over the side. Behind me, I hear nickering and squealing and the men speaking low. “Don’t look, Kate,” I say. But I always do.</p>
<p>Ibn starts at the head, breathing hard and fast as he takes in the mare’s scents, and moves, herky-jerky, to Cammy’s rump. Her back legs are hobbled, and his pink dick hangs long as my arm. As if they all have an agreement, Lloyd slackens the rope, and Ibn rears up, front legs bent at the knees, his hooves against Cammy’s flanks, and the men stand, feet wide and ready, to protect both animals from themselves. Lloyd reaches out and guides Ibn into Cammy. There’s nothing more beautiful than a horse rearing, but this is different. Ibn thrusts. I feel watery.</p>
<p>The second time I saw them breed a mare, I closed my eyes and pretended I was blind. But there came a moment when they all grew deathly quiet, and it was worse than watching. Now, when I watch, I hear that silence even more, and it’s louder every time.</p>
<p>The silence comes again. Lloyd steps back and shortens the rope, and as Ibn backs off, Lloyd pulls him away from Cammy. John releases her legs and pulls the mare forward, so the horses are safely apart. John strokes her neck. “Good girl,” he coos. He leads her from the ring. Lloyd removes Ibn’s halter, pats his shoulder, and looks up. As I turn back to the manure, my cheeks crackle.</p>
<p>“Ease off the clutch,” John says.</p>
<p>I ease my left foot back while pressing the gas with my right. The old Ford lurches, so I feed it more gas. We move forward, and the spreader clunks behind.</p>
<p>“Good,” John says and nods, his mouth in the upside-down smile that tugs the corners of his gray moustache. “Now take the corner wide. A trailer always rides to the inside.”</p>
<p>I take the corner wide, and we bounce onto the double-track that leads to the pasture. Gears scrape as I shift into second. Ahead of us, Lloyd crosses the track, sitting Ibn’s trot like it isn’t even there. He nods toward us, and John lifts off his baseball cap and gives it a single wave out the window. I’ve never seen anyone but John on the stallion. Don’t look<em>,</em> I think, but my neck betrays me. I study Lloyd from the side, then the back as the truck rolls along. Andrea told me at breakfast that tomorrow, she and John are going to town for feed and worming paste, and I imagine Lloyd striding up to me during their absence, his gaze earnest and yearning, and taking me in his arms. When I finally look away, I realize John is smirking.</p>
<p>“Someday, Kate, you’re going to have men falling all over you,” he says.</p>
<p>I force down a bark of laughter and lean forward to concentrate on driving. I’m wearing a baseball cap with my ponytail threaded through the back, like usual, and I remember Dad saying, “Your sister’s going to have all the looks, so you’d better learn some skills.”</p>
<p>John’s words come as a shock. He knows Dad. They used to be friends, which is how I got here for the summer. I just called John and asked if I could work for him. Dad was furious. But they talked and talked on the phone, and he let me come.</p>
<p>“Hey,” John says and makes me look at him. His moustache is straight now. “I know life’s been hard. You deserve better.”</p>
<p>“How were you and Dad ever friends?”</p>
<p>“Your mother’s leaving hardened him.”</p>
<p>“He <em>made</em> her leave.”</p>
<p>“I had my part in that. Your mother was . . . special.”</p>
<p>The truck lurches before I realize my foot’s off the gas. I concentrate on driving, but the double-track’s a haze.</p>
<p>John shakes his head. “He wasn’t always cruel, Kate.” After a minute he adds, “And he let you come here.”</p>
<p>“Because of <em>you</em>.”</p>
<p>“And you,” John says.</p>
<p>I snort.</p>
<p>He studies me. “Think on it,” he says and glances ahead, “Gate.”</p>
<p>I mash on the brake, and his palms meet the dash. The truck’s door groans as he climbs out. My ears burn from the blood in them. I look down where the seat was cracked and is repaired with glue in a neat line.</p>
<p>John clanks loose the chain, swings the gate open, and lets me drive through. As I wait for him to climb back in the cab, Lloyd and Ibn canter through pale yellow grass along the fence line. I gaze at them and wonder if my mother ever felt this fire for Dad. And if she came to regret it. The memory of her dark braid and slender hands are all I’ve got of her. John must know I wish <em>he</em> was my father and Andrea was my mother.</p>
<p>John walks up to the driver’s side window and surprises me. I fix my eyes on the steering wheel.</p>
<p>“You’ve got it from here,” he says. As he turns to stroll back to the barn, he gives two quick slaps against the Ford’s side and says, “Atta girl.”</p>
<p>I study his lanky, bowlegged stride in the side mirror. He knew Mom’s face, knew my parents as lovers. I try to imagine him and my father as friends. However it happened back then, I’m glad.</p>
<p>I drive to the pasture’s far side, get out, and ratchet open the lever on the spreader. I bump back and forth with shit rooster-tailing behind and John’s words echoing in my head. I take a long look in the rearview. I have muddy green eyes, a straight nose. Nothing remarkable. I’m shaking my head as I get out of the truck and see Lloyd and Ibn canter toward me.</p>
<p>I’m shocked still, but my knees drift. Ibn is an accomplishment of nature, and Lloyd is an even match. His head is tilted forward, and his right hand is steady in front of his stomach while his left, on the reins, is relaxed. As they get closer, little puffs rise when the stallion’s hooves meet dirt, and I think about rain but smell baked grass, distant pine, and manure. I hear saddle leather creaking, the stallion’s rhythmic exhalations, and the powerful squeak that rises from Ibn’s flanks.</p>
<p>Part of me expects him to ride right on by. Other than a nod, Lloyd’s never said a word to me. But he stops. He dismounts, lifts the reins over Ibn’s ears, and turns to me. I realize I haven’t moved, that the Ford’s door stands open.</p>
<p>“Kate,” he says and nods. He squints across the mountains as Ibn chomps the bit. Etched on his belt buckle is a bronc rider with <em>Snake River Stampede</em> arced across the top. Ibn whinnies at the mares in the next pasture, and their heads yank up from the grass.</p>
<p>I can’t speak. I’ve never been this close to him alone. I have to look up a little and fire sears through me. His eyes are blue, I realize. I had it wrong.</p>
<p>“I wonder if you’d like to have lunch tomorrow,” he says, and it’s all I can do not to collapse against the Ford.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I say.</p>
<p>“The house. Noon.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>He lifts the reins over Ibn’s swiveling ears and mounts. I feel the muscles beneath his clothes and concentrate on breathing. He glances down at me, and his lips hold a trace of smile. His bootheel presses gently into Ibn’s side, and he leans forward as they trot away.</p>
<p>It takes me a while to move, but I don’t care because I know he won’t look back. What just happened settles from my ears to my mouth in a smile, to my neck in a blush. My nipples harden, and I bend at the waist till my belt buckle jabs me. I put my hand over my heart and feel pounding.</p>
<p>“Holy crap,” I say.</p>
<p>As I haul the spreader back, I glance in the rearview again and again.</p>
<p>John and Andrea pull up by the barn as they’re leaving, and Andrea gestures for me to come over.</p>
<p>“There’s plenty of lunch in the fridge,” she says, and she lifts her blond eyebrows high. Behind me, Lloyd lunges a visiting mare in the ring, and Andrea glances at him, then at me. She bites one side of her lip, which I’ve seen her do when she worries. She catches herself and smiles. “We’ll be back around three. Need anything?”</p>
<p>I shake my head.</p>
<p>Beyond her, John grins. He shifts the truck into first, and I watch the tailgate as they roll away.</p>
<p>“You should’ve told ’em, Kate,” I mutter.</p>
<p>I turn and see Lloyd, leaned back slightly to offset the lunge-line, the mare trotting, content, in a circle around him. I study the contour up the back of his Wranglers into the small puff of his shirt, along his back, to his shoulders, and into his hat. The truck is a distant plume of dust as I head to the barn.</p>
<p>Lloyd has his jobs and I have mine, but the three times we pass, he stares at me, and despite my efforts, I blush. When he’s not near, I know where he is, and I can feel his body. I wonder if this sensing a person without seeing him is love. I imagine Mom sensing Dad.</p>
<p>Later, I imagine Mom sensing John, Dad sensing them sensing each other. Even though this would have happened before John married Andrea, I don’t like it. Instead, I picture Andrea from my first week here. She’s flushed, curvy in a dress, and pointing at my dinner in the oven before heading out to celebrate her five-year anniversary.</p>
<p>By eleven thirty, when I head to the house, anyone touching me would get scorched.</p>
<p>I take the fastest shower in history, brush out my hair, and when I open the drawer for clean underwear, I notice a little velvet box on my dresser. Inside is a silver necklace with a charm of a horse rearing. Underneath, is a tiny heart cut from construction paper with <em>From J-n-A </em>written on it.</p>
<p>My hand covers my mouth as I settle on the bed. It’s easier when people are mean, I think. I flop back, naked, and feel like crying for how I’ve lied by keeping quiet when I hear the screen door slam.</p>
<p>I get dressed like a tornado and start for the kitchen, but I stop and put on the necklace. My skin is tanned where the silver horse rests, and my plain neck turns beautiful. I touch it, sigh, and stroll to the kitchen.</p>
<p>Lloyd’s hat hangs on a hook by the door, and he sits at the table. On it are cold fried chicken, potato salad, coleslaw, and fresh strawberries. He stands as I enter.</p>
<p>“Kate,” he says and nods.</p>
<p>“Lloyd,” I say.</p>
<p>He pulls out the chair beside him. I can barely walk. I sit down, and he slides the chair forward behind me.</p>
<p>Lloyd lives in the cabin out back, but its kitchen is spare, so he’s here most mornings. Sometimes lunch. Rarely dinner. He’s usually out nights, and I’ve listened to his truck roll in after midnight with the radio playing low.</p>
<p>His hand rests on the table in a loose fist. I’ve stared at it while we’ve eaten with John and Andrea and imagined its calluses moving along my stomach. That hand reaches for the chicken and holds up the platter. I take a piece I know I won’t eat.</p>
<p>When Andrea and John are here, I keep my eyes off Lloyd. Now, they move up the arm of his clean, blue shirt to his shoulder, and finally up to his face. I work to keep my breathing even. I notice that he has pocks up his neck and across his cheeks. A scar runs along his jaw, and the corners of his eyes and mouth are lined. Where his hair is newly trimmed over his ear and into his sideburn, there’s a thread of pale skin. I picture him in the barber chair and see he’s older than I thought. His nights out grow darker. I hear murky bars and tinkling ice in highball glasses. I smell the perfume of dusky women with low-cut shirts. I suck in my breath. My hands fall to my lap. I swallow hard. I’m fourteen, and this is a real cowboy.</p>
<p>I study the food on the table. It’s too carefully prepared to be leftovers. Before us are two glasses of lemonade, one of which Lloyd lifts to his lips, and I watch his sharp, clean-shaven Adam’s apple go up, then down. Lloyd never drinks lemonade; he drinks water, black coffee, and beer. I touch the necklace and picture Andrea worrying her lip as she prepared this food.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to do this,” I say.</p>
<p>Lloyd assesses me like I’m a horse puzzling him. I feel the weight of his eyes, and I sweat, even on my stomach. I bunch the napkin in my lap and consider setting it on the table and leaving. But I can’t.</p>
<p>Finally, he shakes his head. “It’s just lunch.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” I croak. I reach for the potato salad.</p>
<p>We don’t talk, we just eat, but his body is hot and dangerous beside me, and I think, Dad was right: I’m plain. How could I have been so stupid?</p>
<p>When we finish, we clean up with no sound but the scoot of dishes, the clink of silverware, and the faucet. As I turn from the sink, our arms touch. Our eyes meet, and mine fill with tears, so I look down.</p>
<p>“Come here,” he says as he pulls me into his arms. They feel just like I’d imagined, except all I do is rest my head against his chest. The pearl snap of his shirt presses into my cheek, his chest rises and falls, and his belt buckle brands my stomach, just above my own. He smells like cigarettes and leather, and I wet his shirt with my tears. The dangerous part of me heats up, but he pulls back. He takes my cheek in his hand and runs his thumb along my jaw. He leans down and kisses me, just in front of my ear, then on my jawbone.</p>
<p>“John’s right. You’re something <em>special</em>,” he says with a trace of a smile, and he’s at the door, reaching for his hat and stepping out in one motion. The screen door claps.</p>
<p>The ghost of his lips holds me still. His words unravel me, and I steady myself against the counter. I wobble to the porch and lean on the rail. My bones kindle as I watch Lloyd disappear into the barn, sense him setting to work. I press the stallion charm between my fingers and saw it back and forth along the chain. I feel the bump of each link against my neck.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ray leans over Rebecca’s shoulder and crosses her right leg over her left. There is the familiar clunk as her pump clatters to the floor. “Oh, Rebecca,” he says, and replaces the red heel on her slender foot, then pushes her chair in toward the kitchen table. Ray places a napkin on his lap and gives Rebecca’s hand a squeeze as he says grace. Then he eats: scrambled eggs with Tabasco, news radio in the background.</p>
<p>Except for the occasional exclamation, Ray does not speak to Rebecca—that would be odd. Sometimes, it seems, she looks so hard into his eyes he thinks she’s about to say something. Other times she’s all blank stare, drifting.</p>
<p>There is a curtained window above the kitchen sink shaded by a large Poplar tree. If someone happened to walk by and look in they would see what appeared to be a couple enjoying breakfast.</p>

<p>Hi Ray—</p>
<p>Yes, I remember speaking with you last January. Welcome back. There is approximately a four-month wait for Rebecca. This can be reduced to two months with an expedite fee of $500.</p>
<p>To answer your questions:</p>
<p>1)     You are correct, heads are interchangable. You wrote, in addition to Rebecca (Style #2), you were eying the Stephanie head (Style #8) which is regularly $250, but I can give you 10% off as a volume discount.</p>
<p>2)     The skeletal system is too flexible to allow her to stand upright. Rebecca will have the relaxed state of a sleeping girl.</p>
<p>3)     You can soak Rebecca in a hot bath or put her under an electric blanket to create the sensation of body heat. Silicone retains heat very effectively.</p>
<p>All best,</p>

<p>On his way to work Ray stops at the Seven Eleven to buy a cheese danish, some floss and the paper. He is tall, slim and handsome which gives people, women mostly, the misperception he knows his way around the female sex. “Fine day, isn’t it?” the cashier says, eyes cast down, and slowly counts out Ray’s change, touching his palm with two quarters and a nickel. “Come back soon.” She looks into his eyes. Ray nods and leaves.</p>
<p>As the car idles Ray reads the front page and local business section before turning to the obits, a habit he’d taken to when his mother died five years ago. Ray and his mother lived as if they were one life slipped inside the other. They sat for hours, quiet together, Ray reading, she knitting or doing the crossword. As such, they communicated.</p>
<p>The week she died he clipped her obituary and, while it didn’t bring his mother home, it pinpointed her to a specific place even if it was only page thirty-two of the<em> Des Moines Register</em>.</p>
<p>He kept her room exactly as she had left it and slipped the piece of newsprint into a copy of <em>Ladies Home Journal</em>. Once a week he went in to dust and wind the bedside clock.</p>

<p>When Ray hears the delivery truck pull up to the house the sensation is that of a white, hot flash—blinding but on the inside. He opens the garage door and waves the truck up the drive. It takes three large men to lower the wooden crate off the truck bed. If they know what it is they don’t let on.</p>
<p>Ray signs by the X and watches the truck pull away. As the garage door closes, a puff of air floats the yellow receipt up off the crate. It dips from side to side, rising a bit each time as it falls. Ray sits on a broken chair and stares at the crate for a long while. Sitting, not doing, in the stillness of the garage with the crate’s potential resting before him, Ray could not so much stop time as hold it till he felt ready.</p>
<p>At a later point, as if on command, he takes the electric drill from the pegboard and sets to removing the one hundred and twenty screws on the crate lid. Twenty minutes later he lifts the top and sees a shoulder covered in gingham. He breathes in, wipes sweat and swallows. As the peanuts fall away, Rebecca, shipped upright and seated, looks as if all she is waiting for is an outstretched hand to help her up.</p>
<p>Ray hoists Rebecca over his shoulder and carries her into the house setting her gently on the living room sofa. At first it feels awkward. He finds himself going wherever she isn’t, occasionally coming upon her with genuine surprise. He starts to feel like the house isn’t his. “This is ridiculous,” Ray says out loud and puts his fork down. He walks to the edge of the linoleum and peers into the living room. He sees Rebecca, right where he left her, reclining on the sofa.</p>
<p>As he approaches he clears his throat and sits in the chair adjacent to the corner where she lies. He leans back staring straight ahead, trying to look at her from the side. Her ears are pierced with cheap studs. Ray makes a mental note to buy new.</p>
<p>Hi, he thinks. Then out loud, “Hello.” Ray swallows and rises. “Rebecca, I’m Ray,” he says, and extends his hand. He takes a deep breath. “Nice to meet you.” You’re so beautiful,&#8221; he thinks, and starts to say as much but changes his mind and ends up exhaling a sort of choking sound. He laughs out of embarrassment, the clog of a sound he’d just produced echoing in his head and laughs some more. “Not you,” he says. “What I—” He laughs harder, doubles over and catches himself against the arm of the sofa, his giggling now high-pitched and baby-like. His stomach aches with the convulsions. After a minute or so he wipes his eyes and sits beside Rebecca. He lays his hand lightly over her long fingers and stays like that for a full fifteen minutes before falling asleep in a column of afternoon sun.</p>
<p>When Ray wakes the room is dark and he is hard. He looks over and sees Rebecca lying back on the sofa, legs crossed at the ankles. He runs his hand along the lower part of her arm, up and down slowly. Soft, he thinks. He senses no resistance.</p>
<p>In the dark he can’t quite see her so he runs his hand further up her arm into the gully between her shoulder and neck. With his other hand Ray reaches down to adjust himself but immediately, as if by magic, his pants are at his knees, Rebecca’s dress is up, and as if propelled, he is inside her.</p>
<p>After five vigorous minutes Ray rolls off breathing heavily. He leans his head back, opens his mouth and exhales. With the fingers of his left hand he feels his way over and pulls Rebecca’s dress down giving her leg a friendly pat.</p>
<p>For the next forty-eight hours Ray explores Rebecca with great enthusiasm. He lays her down. He sits her up. He spreads her legs. He bends her knees. He puts her on her stomach, side and rear. He uses pillows, blankets and a heating pad. He puts her legs over, beside and behind her head. He especially likes her on her knees, elbows bent, at your service. He stops only to eat, sleep and watch <em>60 Minutes</em>. By the end of day two he feels he knows Rebecca well enough to attempt oral and finishes with a loud whisper of, “Thank you, thank you, thank you.”</p>

<p>Hi Ray—</p>
<p>Glad to hear Rebecca arrived safely. Re: perfume—do <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> apply directly to the skin. KY and baby products (no Vaseline!) are all we recommend. As for makeup, try Origins. It’s a little pricey but their line is pretty much all-natural and we’ve had no problems.</p>

<p>“5’10”, 36-25-30,” Ray tells the saleswoman in lingerie. “Something classy,” he says, looking back at the short, squat woman who jostled him with her shopping bags. “Nothing cheap.”</p>
<p>“Gown and robe? Bra and panty? Teddy? Chemise?” the saleswoman asks, gesturing toward four different mannequins with each pronouncement. Ray walks up to the first and rubs the silk robe between his index and thumb. “That’s nice,” he says, and reaches up to right the mannequin’s wig which had tipped too far to the left.</p>
<p>Once home, Ray enters the house quietly and drops his keys on the table. He walks past the kitchen and down the hall stopping first in the bathroom to fill the tub. He then makes his way to the bedroom where he takes off his boots and lays on the bed. “Becca,” he says leaning over in the dark, feeling with his fingers for her lips. “Evening, sweetheart,” he says, gently kissing her and, whether it is the lip balm he’d applied that created a fine suction or something more, he experiences Rebecca kissing back. He rests on his side, an arm draped over her hip, “I got you something. Come on,” he whispers then hoists her over his shoulder and carries her down the hall into the bathroom where he gently lays her into the pool of steaming bubbles.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Ray pulls the plug and the tub begins to drain. The soapy water is milky white. After drying himself he towels Rebecca’s hair and wraps it turban-style around her head. Using the hand-held sprayer he hoses off the islands of bubbles that remain on her skin. He then mixes a solution of one-part baby shampoo to five-parts warm water and, using a turkey baster, sets to gently cleaning. Ray hums a bright but nameless tune as he carefully squirts and refills, squirts and refills.</p>
<p>There was a time Ray had enjoyed aspects of live women—the smell of fresh-washed hair, seeing legs atop high heels, the flutter of animated hands, but women were unpredictable. They often became upset. Janice, the last woman he’d dated, three years ago for four months left his house half naked at 2:00 am after Ray had reached over her to jot down an idea during lovemaking.</p>
<p>“Janice?” Ray called, stumbling out of bed. He made it to the hallway just as the front door slammed. He stood flaccid and confused at the living room window as he watched her Jetta peel away.</p>
<p>Ray rubbed his tired eyes and walked back to the bedroom. On the way he passed his mother’s room and stopped. With his hand on the knob he stood there for a full minute before continuing down the hall.</p>

<p>Hi Ray—</p>
<p>We have had many special requests for custom configurations over the years, but yours is a first. I spoke with Rick and, while he has never attempted a pregnant body, he is confident he can meet the challenge. In order to execute this we have to build a custom mold requiring an additional charge of $1500 for a total of $8000 for the four-month body only. And, yes, of course, the Rebecca head will fit. I look forward to hearing back from you.</p>
<p>All best,</p>

<p>Three months later a second Rebecca arrives, identical in every way to the original except this one appears four months pregnant. Ray is particularly pleased with the taut roundedness of Rebecca’s belly complete with a dark line of skin running from the belly button down. And, while he knows it can’t be true, he could swear, when the light hits her cheeks, she looks just the slightest bit flushed.</p>
<p>Pregnant Rebecca is heavier and more difficult to move around, one hundred twenty five pounds of dead weight, but when Ray imagines his future, it’s as if his chest has bust wide open. Each day he can’t wait for the sun to fall so he can get to bed and happen upon a swelling belly in the middle of the night. When he does he simply caresses it, caresses her. The infinite roundedness and what it holds, perfectly packaged and protected, fascinates him. Ray presses all five fingers into the pliable silicone and, as the material regains its shape, he senses potential pushing back. He does not have sex with her. He reserves that business for original Rebecca, now headless on a cot in a downstairs closet.</p>
<p>Ray wraps a variety of holiday gifts and cuts another piece of ribbon. They are all for Rebecca so he needn’t label them but he does and sets them beneath the table tree. Reflections from glass ornaments climb up and down the walls as gas flames dance across fabricated logs. Ray sits Rebecca across from the hearth. Her cheeks light up from the glow. Billie Holiday plays on the stereo. Ray warms a glass of brandy in one palm and rests the other on top of her rising belly. Her hair is pulled back in a loose pony, face washed, scrubbed fresh and natural—a mother to be.</p>
<p>More and more Ray wants to share new Rebecca with the world, with those whom he comes into contact throughout the week—the checker, the mechanic, the waitress. He knows on some level this will never happen, but still, he thinks. He pictures the hostess’ face as he walks into the diner to be seated. “Two, Annie,” he would say.</p>
<p>Having leaned against her, Rebecca has slid several inches down the sofa. Sitting low and at an angle she looks confused or perhaps frightened. “Sh, sh,” and, “now, now,” Ray says, laying his head atop her belly. He imagines a kick, but after thirteen months he wants more.</p>

<p>To live in a constant state of expectancy is thrilling. Ray packs an overnight case and keeps it under the bed. Occasionally, he takes it out and goes over the contents. Will Rebecca be comfortable in this, he asks himself holding up a flannel nightgown. As the seasons change he swaps out wool for cotton, boots for sandals.</p>
<p>In preparation for the big day Ray practices. On weekends, around two or three in the morning, he loads the suitcase and buckles Rebecca into the passenger seat. He raises the garage door and the two of them sit, as if. After fifteen minutes or so Ray gets out of the car, walks just beyond the garage, onto the drive and looks in at Rebecca, ready to go.</p>
<p>Engrossed in this vision, Ray doesn’t notice the approaching car delivering the day’s news. A tossed paper catches him mid-calf. He falls more in surprise than pain. There is the sound of breaks screeching and the repetitive bell of the car door as the newspaper man jumps out, keys still in the ignition.</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry. I didn’t see you,” the man says, running towards Ray then, “You ok?”</p>
<p>“I’m ok. I’m ok.” Ray fends off help and pushes himself to standing. He shields his eyes from the headlights.</p>
<p>“Sure you ok?” the man asks, looking around. He sees a woman in the car and yells in her direction, “I’m sorry.” Ray follows the man’s line of sight and sees Rebcecca, staring from the front seat, leaning to the left, mouth slightly open. She looks foreign to him. The man takes a step toward the car.</p>
<p>“I’m ok. We’re ok,” Ray says, limping as fast as he can toward the garage. He waves the man off, hits the button and the garage door begins to lower. The man, still standing in the drive, disappears in sections from the head down.</p>
<p>Ray rushes to the car, to the passenger side, throws the door open and unbuckles Rebecca tearing her nightgown in the process. He hoists her heavy body over his shoulder and runs her downstairs where first Rebecca and the four-month body are waiting on a beanbag chair and a cot, respectively, in the spare bedroom.</p>
<p>Ray is hot and he is sweaty. He lays eight-month Rebecca down rather indelicately. She hits the wall with a thud. “Sorry, I’m sorry,” he says, and begins unscrewing her head with haste, catching and tearing some hair in the threads. “I’m sorry,” he repeats, this time yelling and begins attaching the head to the four-month body, but as he does so something doesn’t feel right, there is no comfort, so he tries placing the head on the original body until he catches a glimpse of himself and the three headless dolls in the mirror. He freezes and in that instant it is as if a photo is snapped in his mind, a permanent memory created, never to be altered or undone. Another end, he thinks. Silicone head in hand, Ray falls back against the wall, heaving.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Riddle Me This</strong></p>
<p>It was comforting to sit in the car in front of Mike and Sally’s house at sunrise and watch the dark shapes around me name themselves houses and pines.  Their unpaved street looked familiar, and I tried to remember where I’d seen it before as I checked the rear-view mirror and waited for a light to come on inside the house so I could go in and tell my friends what had happened and ask them to let me stay with them for a few days while I figured out where to go next.</p>
<p>The husband I’d fled that morning was some fraction Cherokee, tall and graceful and strong.  We were just out of college when we met.  Though <em>met</em> is too humble a word for how we began.  For that occasion, something tectonic is needed, something momentous.  Collided might work.  Drowned.</p>
<p>He lived on the grounds of a big, brick, house that had once been a rich man’s home. By the time we entered each other’s orbits, crab-grass had sprouted in the cracks of the long, curved driveway; the empty swimming pool had filled with leaves; the lawn had surrendered to dandelions.  The house itself had been cut up into a labyrinth of incense-soaked rooms where Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and The Rolling Stones looked down from the walls and dared us to follow them.  In the kitchen, a pot of brown rice always bubbled on the stove.  He’d built himself a loft in the greenhouse, and when I walked in–looking for a place, I said–he was perched on the edge of the platform, eating a slice of cantaloupe.  He looked down, I looked up, and when I picture his face now, forty years past the fear and confusion, the rage and sorrow and regret, why do I remember the startling joy of that moment and how we went tumbling, sliding, flying into a bright maze of love?</p>
<p>When his grandmother heard that we were living together, her blood pressure started to climb.  She might have a stroke, his mother said, she might <em>die</em>, if we didn’t stop living in sin and get married.  Living in sin? we said.  Married?  The words tasted rancid and stale.  Jimi, Janis and Mick had never spoken them.  But the man I loved was her favorite grandchild, and so we went to see his grandmother.  She lived in the country outside of Columbia, South Carolina, in a small white house under a big water oak, on the farm she’d worked with her husband since they’d married at fifteen.</p>
<p>“I feel like I already know you,” I said to her through the screen door that she unlatched to let us into her kitchen.  And that was true.  Every night we lay in his greenhouse loft, under the clear night sky and under the rain, taking in each other’s lives and making them our own.  I’d heard how his grandfather shinnied up a pecan tree one day to shake down the nuts, and on the nex, he fell down dead.  I knew that on hog-killing day every fall, his grandmother led her daughters and nieces behind the barn to boil and scrape the intestines, to spare the men that awful stench.  That detail had stuck to me:   The women scraping hog guts behind the barn so as not to offend.  But that world, like the world of living in sin, was already so far behind us the distance made it harmless.  We could look back at it tenderly, generously, excusing its faults and cruelties as though they had happened in a dream.</p>
<p>“Well, come on in the house,” she said, and unlatched the door. She shook my hand, refused to hug.  In his grandmother’s kitchen that day, my love and I held hands under the table while she peeled apples in continuous spirals and sliced the fruit into a dishpan for the pies she was going to make later.</p>
<p>“We’re promised to one another,” he told her.  “We’re married in our hearts.”  I loved his earnestness then, and remembering it now, I still love it, and that feeling surprises me, the way that remembering the moment we met surprises me.  I thought the memory of love had disappeared.   And of course he didn’t convince her that we were special or exempt from any rules.  When we left, she latched the screen-door behind us, went back to her apples.  That was a bad sign, he said later.  At the end of the visit she usually loaded him down with food, stood on the back stoop and waved and waved while he drove away.   Sure enough, she went on fretting and grieving, grieving and fretting until we gave up and got married.  We were already married in our hearts, we said, what difference did a few words and a piece of paper make?</p>
<p>We got married and moved down to Atlanta, where he went to work on a construction crew, building houses in the ever-expanding suburbs.  Once I watched him carry a whole sheet of plywood across the roof beam of a three-story house, and I was not afraid; he was that sure-footed.  But before long, he was cheating on me and I was cheating on him, to get even.  Cheating was what had sent me to the street in front of Mike and Sally’s house.  The night before that dawning day, he’d gone out the way he did almost every night, and when he wasn’t home by midnight, I walked back across the street to the party I’d left earlier and the host and I finished what we&#8217;d started.  At five, when I went home, my husband was waiting in the yard.  If an upstairs neighbor hadn’t heard the shouting and come out to help, who knows what might have happened?  But he did, and I got away and drove to Mike and Sally’s place, and later that week, while I was hiding out, not giving off much heat or light, not sending up any smoke, my husband found the body of a woman who had been stabbed to death and dumped in the kudzu on some vacant land near our house,where he’d gone to walk and think.</p>
<p>I read an article once about how the need for revenge is a drive that lights up the brain as brightly as hunger or thirst.  Amen I say to that.  I have not seen or talked to my first husband in close to forty years, and yet, remembering the story of the old woman’s body and how the police had questioned him, I <em>still</em> hope they noticed the gold ring that I’d slipped on his finger in front of his grandmother and her God and asked him where <em>his</em> wife was.  I hope that when he understood why they were asking, his mind went as clear and still and his vision sharpened, as mine had gone on the morning when he could have killed me, and he saw himself as a small frightened creature scheming to survive.  I wish that for him as sincerely as I still sometimes wish him well.  Even now it’s satisfying to imagine the woman’s body at his feet, dead of a dozen wounds, the cops waiting for an answer, and him with no place in his mind where I could be found.</p>
<p>I must have slept for a few minutes in front of Mike and Sally’s house,  because when I opened my eyes again, the night was finished and a fresh day had begun.  I saw the road with fresh eyes, too; I knew why it looked familiar.  It was like the hard-packed dirt road in front of the house where I grew up, the road I used to walk out onto and imagine how far it could take me.  In front of Mike and Sally’s house I told myself that story again.  I could drive away from him and us and this, cross a country’s worth of rivers and mountains and deserts full of bleached bones and scouring wind until I came to a place where the past was lost, even to memory, and we had never met.</p>
<p><strong>         All Hallows Eve</strong></p>
<p>He opened the door to let her in, dressed for the costume party in a pair of wide brown trousers held up with beige suspenders, a white shirt with a pillow stuffed inside. “Who are you?” she said.</p>
<p>“Myself a few years ago,” he said. “This is my largest shirt, a size 20, my biggest pants, size 50.” He’d lost ninety pounds since he’d worn those clothes, and she was glad she hadn’t met him when they fit. Wearing them again made him thoughtful. “When you’re fat,” he said, holding out the waistband of the pants, “people treat you like you’re not human. So who are you?”</p>
<p>She unbuttoned her cloth coat to show him. She was wearing a pink shirtwaist dress with a wide skirt, high-heeled shoes, rhinestone ear clips and a big smile. June Cleaver was the general impression she was going for. They had known each other for six months. “Let’s forget the party,” he said. He took her hand and led her to the bedroom. She was an ambitious woman, but sometimes she liked to forget that and let him boss her. Sometimes he worried that he was too gentle, so bossing her suited him, too. Playing this game, they both felt free, as though they’d crawled out of old skins, left them to crumble away to nothing.</p>
<p>In the bedroom, he took off his fat man’s clothes. “Come sit next to me,” he said. “Don’t take your clothes off yet. I’ll tell you when.” They went on like that until she was naked except for her bra, one strap pulled off of her shoulder and a necklace he liked to touch, a small gold locket that rested in the warm hollow of her throat. “Get up and put on some lipstick,” he said. She did, and when she sat down on the bed again he touched the necklace and pulled her down for a kiss, hard enough to insist but not to hurt–that was their understanding–but suddenly, she was afraid, and when he saw that he stopped playing. “Tell me,” he said.</p>
<p>She was tumbling back forty years, she said. She’d been a young woman then, a marriage in ruins back in the States, sleeping on the floor of a friend’s room over a pub in London and washing dishes in exchange for rent. Every day, she drank too much, and almost every night, she found someone to sleep with, believing that being reckless made her free. Even now, from this distance, that time smelled like mutton fat, she told him, like the scraps of shepherd’s pie that she pushed off the greasy plates and into the slop hole in the kitchen every day.</p>
<p>There was one man in particular, she said. Irish. He came into the pub every afternoon with his morose long-haired friend who jumped up from his chair every time he saw her, stalked over to the jukebox and punched in “American Woman.” One drunken night, the three of them went back to the Irish man’s flat in Camden Town, and he got rough with her while his friend sat in a chair beside the bed and watched. She remembered the gritty sheets against her back, the smell of beer and unwashed clothes, the way his friend watched and laughed. She remembered feeling that she was lying on the bottom of the ocean where no one would think to look for her, staring up at the bright surface and feeling she might never get there again.</p>
<p>She thought she’d lost the locket that night, she said. It came off but she wasn’t going to leave without it, and she’d searched until she found it in the tangled sheets after the Irish man passed out and his friend went home. And then she was outside on the sidewalk in Camden Town, flagging down a taxi, holding the locket tightly in one hand. On the ride back to the West End she’d looked at it from time to time, as though it were her ticket home, proof that she had survived.</p>
<p>“And here you are,” he said, and he touched the necklace lightly.</p>
<p>“Here I am,” she said. She moved her hands over his belly, which was all that was left of the fat man he’d been, and thought of how they’d both come to this bed accompanied, hoping for welcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Little Bone </strong></p>
<p><strong>             </strong>Now it is a cold bright January day, and she sits at her dining room table, eating a bowl of minestrone soup and watching the birds come and go at the feeder that the man she is in love with has hung outside the window there. She is a long way past the dirt street, past London and the slow collapse of another marriage, then more years devoted to the conservation of resources and expectations. Years in which she sometimes covered three different casseroles with the same sheet of tin-foil, rinsed and dried the same plastic bag to take her ham and cheese sandwich to work all week. Now this, she says to herself. Now this. Meaning the soup, the birds, the sun coming through the dining room window that warms her face the way the man warms her body with his hands and his mouth, as though happiness were a single sheet of some beautiful substance that you broke smaller pieces of happiness from. She is enjoying herself like that when she bites down on something hard.</p>
<p>Who put a stick in the soup? she thinks, but what she pulls out of her mouth is a small, thick, gray femur, the kind of bone a witch might pull from her mouth when she was done with the little man she’d been feasting on. The sight of the bone is shocking at first, an insult in a pleasant conversation, a sudden famine in a rich land. And then, after the shock at the fact of the thing has passed, comes the thought that she could have choked on this bone. She could have choked to <em>death. </em>Choking to death while eating alone is one of her most stubborn fears. Before she met the man who hung the bird-feeder, the idea of choking to death had come to stand for the danger of living alone, without love.</p>
<p>Next morning, she finds the bone on the cutting board beside the sink where she left it. Dry now, it has turned an ancient white, like a relic, so light it feels almost harmless. Though of course it is not harmless, and she knows that, too. She can as easily choke to death on a dry bone as a wet one; she can choke now when she feels rich as easily as when she felt poor, and how is that fair is what she’d like to know. With love or without it, everyone sleeps alone sometimes or drives or eats or walks or breathes alone. Your heart, of course, always beats alone. The dangers and the possibilities for harm multiply as endlessly as the chances for happiness. Multiply and sprawl and mix until they look like the same big chance, the only chance you’re given, your life.</p>
<p>Later, as they sit outside her house together, watching the night come down, she tells him about the bone in the soup and about her fear of choking to death. For this fear, as for others she has confided in him, he has a cure; he can teach her to do the Heimlich maneuver on herself against the back of a chair. “What if you’re choking in an empty room?” she says. “What if you’re choking outside without a chair in sight?”</p>
<p>She sees by the dismay that crosses his face that she’s let him down again; in spite of his tenderness, his efforts to heal her of pessimism and wariness, she’s imagined the worst again. “Why do you say things like that?” he says, and she says she’s sorry, she’s not being flippant, but she doesn’t know. Maybe they have come to the place in their story where they are soup <em>and</em> bone to one another. “I can live with that,” he says, and she says she can, too.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the fall of her senior year, on a Texas afternoon quickly losing its light, JoAnn Parish stepped into her spot on the stage of the Needmore High School auditorium and listened intently for her next line cue. This was the last dress rehearsal of <em>Taming of the Shrew</em> before preview night, when Superintendent Huff and select members of the Needmore volunteer fire and rescue squad were expected to be in attendance. JoAnn was playing Kate, the Shrew. But at this critical moment in the play, when Kate was to waver in the tongue-lashing she had been giving Petruchio and relent with a modest “As you wish, my lord,” JoAnn simply turned to him and said, “Oh, just go to hell.”</p>
<p>None of the actors or actresses arrayed in meticulously-rendered period costumes giggled, least of all dumbstruck Pete Donnelly, who, as an unconvincing Petruchio, had shifted his weight from one ornately-slippered foot to the other before realizing that the words had been directed at him, not his character.</p>
<p>“What did you say?” squalled Miss Medina from the back of the auditorium, where she had been engaged in a ferocious battle with her lighting assistant, a freshman named Wayne Dotson, who had missed every other rehearsal this week on account of his late shift at the Needmore Dairy Queen.</p>
<p>JoAnn, still in character, appeared not to hear. “Line?” she called nonchalantly from the stage, but she knew it was too late for that. No one was holding book.</p>
<p>“I said what did you say, JoAnn Parish? What?” And Miss Medina’s voice, carrying as it was over the heads of Wayne and several other timid underclassmen, had begun to resemble a shriek.</p>
<p>“She said, ‘Oh, just fare thee well,’” replied Kate’s maid in waiting, the buxom and formidable Ivy Constance, who was wearing her aqua sateen dress belted high. She was pregnant.</p>
<p>This time the cast did giggle, and Miss Medina came charging down the aisle at them, but pulled up short in the orchestra pit, where she simply stood and glared.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Miss Medina,” JoAnn finally said. “The lines must have gotten scrambled in my head.” Several other members of the cast nodded, as though they’d had similar problems in the past.</p>
<p>“Wayne Dotson,” Miss Medina snapped. “Find a script.” And she turned again toward the stage. “I dare anyone in this cast to find the words ‘fare thee well’ in any of the speeches of Kate or her maid in waiting or in fact in any speech in the pages Mr. Shakespeare has written so exquisitely for us.”</p>
<p>But somehow Wayne Dotson appeared to have found them. “Here, Miss Medina,” he said. “Act III, scene 4&#8230;’fare thee well ye mutton-headed sop.’”</p>
<p>Miss Medina’s face remained fixed on the mutinous cast. Her eyes narrowed. “Consider this a warning,” she finally said. Then she turned to Wayne Dotson. “Take off that silly cap.” And Wayne dutifully removed his Dairy Queen cap with the letters DQ inscribed smack dab in the center of the Texas map.</p>
<p>“What got into you, Jo?” Ivy asked afterwards in the dressing room.</p>
<p>JoAnn was unfastening the snaps of her pearl gray doublet. She flicked her eyes toward the hallway, where Pete Donnelly was wrestling his glasses away from the boy who’d played Hortensio. Pete’s glasses were those black, horn-rimmed kind that would never be cool, JoAnn thought, unless Buddy Holly came back from the dead.</p>
<p>“Did Pete dump you?” Ivy asked.</p>
<p>The question infuriated JoAnn. She hung the doublet on a hanger, and the hanger on a radiator pipe that snaked along the wall above the mirror and the sink.</p>
<p>“The idiot joined the Marines,” she said. “He leaves for boot camp day after graduation.”<br />
Then she looked straight at Ivy. “Until right before we went on stage, he had told me he was going to UT. It’s the only place I applied.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>“So that’s why I told him where he really ought to go.”</p>
<p>JoAnn kicked off her point shoes and started wrestling with the knot at the front of her suede leggings.</p>
<p>“Were you and Pete planning to get married or something?” Ivy asked.</p>
<p>“Can you see me marrying Pete Donnelly?”</p>
<p>Ivy glanced into the hallway. “No,” she replied.</p>
<p>“He’s just not my type,” JoAnn said. She flung the leggings into the corner with the other items to be washed.</p>
<p>“He has a very small head,” Ivy offered.</p>
<p>“Very small. And he mumbles. I can’t understand half of what he says.”</p>
<p>“But you’re still a couple, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s not the point, Ivy. We never were a couple. We&#8217;re just friends.” She had zipped up her new culottes and, out of respect for Ivy, was trying not to admire her flat tummy in the mirror. But Ivy simply continued to remove the cold cream from her eyelids with a damp Kleenex.</p>
<p>“Look at me,” JoAnn said.</p>
<p>Ivy turned, her mouth ajar.</p>
<p>“You and I are friends, right?”</p>
<p>Ivy nodded.</p>
<p>“And if you had told me that you were going to a certain university, and I had made my plans based on that information, do you think for one minute that you would turn around and, without another word, up and join the United States Marines?”</p>
<p>“No. I’m a girl.”</p>
<p>“Exactly.” But JoAnn was trying to get at something else. “Boys don’t have any idea what friendship among girls means.”</p>
<p>“Men are jerks,” Ivy agreed. “But there’s just one thing wrong with what you said.”<br />
JoAnn waited while Ivy folded her hands across her stomach.</p>
<p>“After graduation, I’m not going to up and do anything.” Ivy stared serenely into her reflection in the mirror. Her expression was familiar&#8211;puzzled, but expectant, like that painting of the Virgin Mary in JoAnn’s <em>Art Through the Ages</em> book. “The Annunciation,” it was called, but JoAnn, who normally had a photographic memory for names and dates, couldn’t remember who’d painted it, or when, or why.</p>
<p>After rehearsal, Miss Medina gave notes that were caustic and brief. When she dismissed the cast and crew with a wave of her script, JoAnn noticed that Pete Donnelly was following her outside, where the sun had just set beneath a thin, shelf-like cloud. The parking lot was nearly empty, and bathed in crimson light. Overhead, an odd, misshapen moon floated in the darkening sky.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe you told me to go to hell in front of everybody,” Pete said.</p>
<p>“I didn’t tell you to do it in front of them,” she replied.</p>
<p>Pete didn’t get it. Slow on the uptake. “People don’t talk like that in public,” he said.<br />
“Maybe they do in Reno or Las Vegas.”</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t know. Never been there.”</p>
<p>“Just let it settle for a while,” Pete said. “I know what I’m doing. I’ve given it a lot of thought.”</p>
<p>“There’s a frigging war going on. Did you give that any thought?”</p>
<p>Pete didn’t respond to that one. He just stood there with the usual high color in his cheeks and a tangle of coarse brown hair sticking out from under his Texas Longhorn cap. JoAnn almost told him he wouldn’t be needing that particular cap anymore, but she caught herself. The war thing was enough. Of course he knew about the war. Of course that’s why he had joined. Pete wasn’t like the other boys he drank beer with after they’d shredded the fields, the boys who said they were worried the war might be over before they could enlist. Pete had just gone ahead and done it, even though at times he thought the war might be flat out wrong.</p>
<p>“Some people say it’s the wrong war in the wrong place,” he had once told her. “They say it’s a mistake and we’re the ones who’re going to pay for it.”</p>
<p>“Not me.”</p>
<p>“They think that all of us will pay for it, Jo.”</p>
<p>All of us. What kind of crazy talk was that? JoAnn thought. The war was a creepy news story half a world away. Wasn’t even a real war, according to her dad. Most of her friends didn’t know which side we were on or how to pronounce the name of the place. And nobody JoAnn knew had any intention of fighting in the damn thing, except maybe Jay Reddick and his dim-wit brother Stan. They talked a lot about joining up as they lolly-gagged around the flag pole in their ROTC uniforms after lowering the colors at the end of the third quarter of football games.</p>
<p>“Anyway, it’s an opportunity for me,” Pete said.</p>
<p>“To get yourself killed?”</p>
<p>”To really go to college when I get out, Jo. Your old man’s loaded.”</p>
<p>“My father’s not well.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean any disrespect to him.”</p>
<p>“What did you mean, then?” JoAnn had stopped short of Pete’s old pickup with the Needmore Fighting Jackrabbits decal on the back.</p>
<p>“This isn’t the end of the world, Jo. This is just one night in a whole bunch of nights.” Pete was gesturing with his arms, a habit Miss Medina had tried fruitlessly to discourage in him.</p>
<p>“You’ve been letting Shakespeare get to you,” JoAnn said as she picked up her pace. Her own truck, her mother’s really, a brand-new Custom Cab, was parked at the other end of the lot, underneath the limbs of a prairie willow like the ones on her family’s place.</p>
<p>“Hey, I don’t even like Shakespeare,” Pete shouted after her.</p>
<p>“Last I heard, he didn’t care much for you either,” she shouted back.</p>
<p>But on her long, solitary walk to the truck, JoAnn got a hint of what Pete was trying to say. It was the last of October, a mild fall so far, but the air had turned cooler just that evening, it seemed, and this night was only one of many that, in fits and starts, would gradually tend toward winter on the Southern High Plains. By Christmas, it’d be howling snow sideways, the pipes would freeze, and she’d be over whatever shock Pete’s decision to enlist had caused. In the years ahead, she would even forget that she had told him to go to hell, only that they had played Kate and Petruchio in the drama club’s production of <em>Taming of the Shrew</em>, and that the play had gone as well as could be expected in a town whose only other live theatrical event was its Sweethearts of the Rodeo pageant and parade.</p>
<p>JoAnn would remember how quiet and thoughtful Pete had been in high school, how that was what had attracted her to him in the first place, and there was one other thing she’d remember: in the parking lot after that particular rehearsal, when, standing beside her mother’s truck and staring at the flat, dark line of the horizon, she understood for the first time the relationship between the sun and the moon and the plane of earth on which she stood. The arrangement was a geometric shape. It extended into space. Shakespeare was right. The world was a stage. Anything might happen here.</p>
<p>Pete Donnelly, for instance, didn’t wait for graduation. He left for boot camp the week after the play closed.</p>
<p>“Who needs a high school diploma in Saigon?” he had asked.</p>
<p>Who needs Saigon? JoAnn wanted to know.</p>
<p>The letters Pete wrote from boot camp were mostly funny, more about people in Needmore than what the training was like. He addressed them to Kate and signed them Petruchio. When he came home on leave after basic, they drove to San Angelo with a bunch of their friends and danced the Cotton-Eyed Joe at the Crazy Chicken, staying long after the place had closed up for the night.</p>
<p>Pete looked good in his military haircut. From the forehead down, he was tanned. Because of the weight he’d lost during training, his jeans and western shirt didn’t fit quite right, but his shoulders seemed broader than they were before. He and JoAnn made out in the backseat of Ivy’s Impala Super Sport on the way home, and the sharpness of Pete’s desire surprised JoAnn almost as much as the sharpness of her own.</p>
<p>“You look happy,” she told him the next day when he stopped by to return a hair clip she’d left in Ivy’s car.</p>
<p>“I am happy,” he said, and grinned.</p>
<p>And they saw each other every night after that until they finally parted under a cold drizzle at the Trailways station while the coyotes at the playa lake raised their unearthly song. Pete held JoAnn for a long time and swore to write more often. As it turned out, she would write much more than he ever did, but she learned to take that in stride.</p>
<p>At Christmas, Pete came home for the very last time. Ivy and her baby’s father, Billy Ray Whitfield, the boy she’d met at Padre Island the previous spring, had decided to tie the knot. JoAnn and Pete stood with the couple when they got married at the courthouse, and the four of them shared a bottle of sparkling cider from a brown paper bag in the back room of Buster’s Place by the gin.</p>
<p>This time when Pete left Needmore, there was hardly a word about what was to come next. He hugged JoAnn all right, and they kissed until she got a crick in her neck, but as he boarded the bus, he just saluted her and smiled a goofy grin.</p>
<p>The letter he wrote from Camp Pendleton, though, the last one before he went overseas, was different, or maybe JoAnn herself was different by then. She’d been watching the evening news and reading every scrap about the war in the Dallas papers. So she was surprised that the body of Pete’s letter made no mention of the war. Instead, it was about a dream he’d had, of clear skies and mule deer, and the way the wind swirled the wheat fields in June.</p>
<p>“The fields are yellow. The canyon’s yellow. There’s yellow everywhere,” he wrote. And beyond the fields, on the edge of the canyon, stood an old farm house, a corral, and a barn. In front of the house lay discarded toys, and out back, where the wash hung on a line stretched between elms, the sheets blew white in the wind.</p>
<p>JoAnn understood she could never show this letter to anyone. It was only for her to read. But she did share Pete’s postscript with her mother and father: “Look for me some night on Huntley and Brinkley. I’ll be the one with ‘Needmore Fighting Jackrabbits’ on the back of my helmet.”</p>
<p>And that, JoAnn’s mother agreed, was Pete. He’d be just the one to do something like that.</p>
<p>On the last day of July, JoAnn left for freshman orientation at the University of Texas, the only woman in her family to ever make it that far. With the rest of the college-bound seniors, all boys, she stood in front of the altar at the Needmore First Methodist Church while everyone came up with words of encouragement, and Mr. Jenkins, the town’s barber and best fiddle player despite having lost two fingers of his left hand in Korea, held up the Hook ‘Em Horns sign, as though he had a choice.</p>
<p>Ivy Constance, now Whitfield, offered to drive her to Austin, since JoAnn had never gotten more than her learner’s permit, and the state troopers would never be as understanding as Clay Burton had been. Clay, also a Methodist, was Needmore’s only cop.</p>
<p>JoAnn’s mother was the saddest to see her off. The former Mary Grace Cannon hugged her daughter so tightly, the poor girl saw stars. Brother Syd was not nearly as demonstrative, but JoAnn could tell his feelings were genuine when he handed her a spiral steno pad with the frequencies and call letters of all the ham operators in Austin and vicinity, just in case of an emergency. JoAnn threw an arm playfully around his neck in what passed as a hug of appreciation, although Syd knew, of course, that she did not own a ham radio, or for that matter, a radio of any kind.</p>
<p>JoAnn’s father, though, was the hardest to say goodbye to, partially because of his natural reticence, but also because of his health. Nobody talked about it much anymore, but he’d been diagnosed with malignant melanoma the year before, something JoAnn had confided early on to Pete Donnelly. The cancer had sprung from a mole the size of an eraser just above her father’s collar bone (he was fair skinned, despite his dark hair), and although the surgeons in Lubbock said they’d gotten it all, early and decisively, JoAnn sensed that her family’s apparent relief was just that, apparent. Appearances were important in West Texas, and Needmore was the kind of place where cancer, unless proven otherwise, was always gotten in time.</p>
<p>“When are you coming back to see us, pumpkin?” her father asked.</p>
<p>“Every weekend, if I could.”</p>
<p>“But definitely for Thanksgiving, right?”</p>
<p>“Why not Halloween? It’s your birthday.”</p>
<p>A joke. His birthday was actually two days before.</p>
<p>He cupped her chin in his hand and looked at her for an inordinate amount of time, as though he were memorizing her features or had just now fully noticed them.</p>
<p>“Come on, Dad. You know you’re glad to see me go.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know about that. Be good.”</p>
<p>“You, too,” she said.</p>
<p>“Come on, slow poke,” Ivy shouted from the Super Sport, and JoAnn smiled at her parents and did her patented backward dance, ducking her head like she did in that photo they kept on the living room mantle, the one when she was five and performing at the Needmore Senior Citizens’ home.</p>
<p>“Bye, y’all,” she said before she turned to go. And she heard their voices rise likewise behind her as the birds in the prairie willows that lined the drive flung themselves into the sky.</p>
<p>The day, meanwhile, had turned off hot and still. A dust storm loomed to the west, but she and Ivy outran it as they headed southeast down highway 84, through speed traps in an infinite procession of small, dust-blown towns that were as familiar to JoAnn as her own face in the mirror, a settled resignation to the enormous, simple fact of Texas.<br />
Ivy hardly said a word to JoAnn when they stopped for snacks at the Sav-A-Lot in Colorado City, and JoAnn thought this odd. Perhaps Ivy was second-guessing her decision to leave the baby in Needmore with Billy Ray. But when the girls turned east onto the only completed section of the new interstate, with its plowed up median and wide, white lanes, Ivy said, “My mother saw Syd and your mother at Albertson’s. He was handling his walker like a pro, up and down the aisles and all.”</p>
<p>“Please keep your eyes on the road,” JoAnn said. She knew Ivy had never driven on an interstate before.</p>
<p>Ivy just turned the radio on. “Billy Ray thinks you’re making a mistake going to Austin. He says it’s nothing but a bunch of hippies there. He asked me if you were one.”</p>
<p>JoAnn looked over at her friend, who was, she decided, so full of crap. “Tell Billy Ray I want to have his next baby. We could start a commune. You could get it on with Pete when he comes home.”</p>
<p>“The things that come out of your mouth,” Ivy said, but she had started to shake with laughter, which caused the car to sway onto the shoulder and back. A semi passed with its horn blaring.</p>
<p>“Jesus,” JoAnn said. And when they stopped for gas at the first Abilene exit, she said, “Let me take the wheel before you get us killed.”</p>
<p>In this way, both of them knew the trip would go by faster, with JoAnn pretending not to know how to drive and Ivy squealing and clutching her heart. They sang along with Patsy Cline’s “Crazy” and Roger Miller’s “King of the Road” and argued about whether Roger had actually been the one to find Patsy’s body&#8211;Ivy insisted he had&#8211;and then they invented stories about the families in station wagons with out-of-state tags until the freeway gave out and turned back into the familiar two-lane.</p>
<p>That’s when JoAnn decided to stop at the next flea market or cheap antique store so she could get a used comforter for her dorm room bed, one that didn’t smell like home.</p>
<p>“Seems like you’d want to bring one from home,” Ivy said.</p>
<p>“Why on earth would I do that?” JoAnn replied.</p>
<p>And it was in the loft of a general store in Cisco, Texas, that JoAnn felt her new life begin. The sign on the outer door had said “Gone to Lunch,” but the door was unlocked, so the girls walked on in. The place was musty and the walls crowded with the heads of dead animals: a pronghorn, a snarling bobcat, an elk with its thick tongue hanging out. A section near the front of the store was devoted to gardening tools and the kind of floppy hats that JoAnn’s mother might try on, but never buy. The counters along the middle aisle were stacked with china and cut glass, most of it marked down. In the back were the stairs to the loft, where it was so dark the girls had to wait a moment for their eyes to adjust, but when Ivy spotted the quilts and comforters and started holding some of them up, JoAnn seemed to have lost her interest in shopping until Ivy said, “What are you gonna do if your daddy dies?”</p>
<p>JoAnn turned to face her. “Who said he was gonna die?”</p>
<p>“Everybody dies,” Ivy shrugged.</p>
<p>“Yeah, so why’d you ask a question like that?”</p>
<p>Ivy appeared to be weighing the heft of an Afghan. “Your mother told my mother it didn’t look good.”</p>
<p>JoAnn felt her stomach drop. Neither her mother nor father had said anything like that to her. They’d just talked about how successful the surgery had been. Didn’t even need to be looked at again for six months. Every six months and then after five years, it’d be like nothing had ever happened to him. Ivy had heard it wrong. Or Ivy’s mother had. Either that, or JoAnn’s parents hadn’t wanted to disturb her right as she was heading off to college, and when she recognized the truth in that thought, she took a step over to an antique elementary school desk and sat down.</p>
<p>“I thought you knew, Jo,” Ivy said. “Mom said he would have to go to the cancer center in Houston for an evaluation and maybe some further tests.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” JoAnn said. “That’s just routine.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s what I figured, too,” Ivy said. “I was just asking like, in general, what you would do if something happened to your dad.”</p>
<p>“I thought your mother had heard something else.”</p>
<p>“No,” Ivy said.</p>
<p>“Good, if that’s all it is.”</p>
<p>“What would you do, though? Syd can’t run a ranch, like he is.”</p>
<p>JoAnn looked at her hand on the school desk. The veins on the back of her hand were livid, and the desk beneath it was scarred with the names and initials of generations of kids. She didn’t think Ivy should have said anything about her father on this trip. She would always resent Ivy a little for that. But she knew the only way to avoid being cold and vengeful was to say exactly what was on her mind, and she did this without really thinking because it was the way she truly felt.</p>
<p>“I’m never going back to Needmore,” she said. “Maybe to visit. Not ever to live.”</p>
<p>Ivy looked stunned.</p>
<p>“I’ve never said it to anybody before,” JoAnn continued, “but I guess that’s the way it is.”</p>
<p>Ivy took a deep breath. “I wish I was you. I hate it back there. For Billy Ray it’s not so bad. He can’t go back to Corpus anyway.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“There’s a warrant out for him.”</p>
<p>“For what?”</p>
<p>“He cut his ex-wife’s boyfriend in a fight.”</p>
<p>“His ex-wife’s boyfriend?” JoAnn said. “You never told me he’d been married before. When’d he get married, when he was fourteen?”</p>
<p>“Billy Ray’s older than he looks,” Ivy said simply.</p>
<p>JoAnn was following her down the stairs by then. Ex-wife. Billy Ray. Good Lord! The things some people would keep from other people, even their best friends. At the bottom of the stairs, JoAnn caught up with Ivy and said, apropos to nothing: “Momma would just have to sell the ranch.”</p>
<p>Ivy nodded and her cheeks reddened. JoAnn didn’t really mean what she’d said. She was just trying it out. She hadn’t even got to Austin yet, but she felt she had already passed beyond that city and would be inventing the rest of her life as she went.</p>
<p>That afternoon, the girls pulled up in front of JoAnn’s dorm, a massive limestone building called Kinsolving, and Ivy offered to help JoAnn get her stuff up to her room on the second floor, but JoAnn told her to just run along and try to get back to her baby as soon as she could. Billy Ray, as a wanted fugitive, could not be trusted to keep an infant fed. The suitcase wasn’t heavy anyway, just clothes, photos, a Bible, a dictionary, a one-volume set of Shakespeare’s plays, and the mesquite jewelry box containing her mother’s high school ring; the string of pearls her father had given her for her sixteenth birthday; Pete Donnelly’s letters from Vietnam (there were twelve); and that list of ham radio operators her brother Syd had pressed into her hand before she left town. “In case of an emergency,” Syd had said, but he didn’t say what kind.</p>
<p>Ivy hugged her, whispered something JoAnn didn’t catch, and then backed down the hill toward the car.</p>
<p>“What?” JoAnn said. “What did you say?”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. I’ll tell you later,” Ivy shouted before she turned with a backward wave of her hand.</p>
<p>JoAnn watched Ivy get into her car, and followed the car with her eyes until it disappeared behind a statue of a man on a horse and a building the color of chalk. Then she looked down the street to her left and back to her right again. The pavement was splotched with sunlight under a curtain of green leaves. There were only a few students scurrying beneath the oaks, the girls in their summer dresses with the Peter Pan collars, the boys spinning basketballs in the air. JoAnn picked up her suitcase and clarinet and headed up the concrete steps to the dormitory door. It had been blazing hot all afternoon, but as she passed into the shadow of the building’s portico, the air felt suddenly cold. She stopped, turned around, and shielded her eyes against the dazzling refraction of light from the windows of the UT Tower and the state capitol and the office buildings downtown. That was the moment she understood how utterly alone she would be from here on out.</p>
<p>The next morning, she took a walk, first toward the Tower, the tallest building she’d ever seen, even taller than the grain elevator in Needmore: so tall that when she stared straight up from its base, the top of the Tower seemed to disappear into haze. She walked completely around it, watching the way the light hit its columns and balustrade, and then she headed west toward Guadalupe Street, where she had been told there would be stores for just about anything she might need. What she needed most was stationery, so she could write to Pete.</p>
<p>JoAnn loved to move through neighborhoods like this&#8211;a visitor walking fast, taking it in and moving right on. Past the gray-green dolphins in the circle of stones by the house with plum shutters and the bright red door; by the telephone poles plastered with announcements for a covered dish supper at the Wesley Foundation and drum lines in concert and French cinema. Books. There were ads for used textbooks and apartments to rent, a carriage house with a view of Barton Springs, cheap burgers, Las Vegas for two. Sex. There were penises, drawn child-like in the margin of otherwise sober notices: prayer vigils for peace, give a damn about something or other, the ink was smeared. The world was on fire. The poets were lost. And then came Guadalupe Street, with its cacophony of sound, color, incense, b.o. and cabbage gone bad, raspberries, Noxzema, a whiff of butterscotch, something dead; the male students all chattering in their khakis and Weejuns without socks, polo shirts, girls with skirts slit up to their crotch and bangles on necklaces they wore around their ankles; suits, uniforms, nurse’s fishnet hose, and a bottle of rum, big as a boxcar and festooned with streamers, like an advertisement for lethargy, unapologetic sloth. But at the street’s core was this energy that would not give up until she had concentrated on every sign she passed, every glazed transom over every door that read “Asian Delights” or “Cameras Repaired, leave your number in the box.” Leather, every store sold leather and hookahs and what was she looking for? Stationery. Stationery?</p>
<p>A newsstand. On the corner. She stopped.</p>
<p>The other pedestrians parted like water around her, and JoAnn ducked inside. The air was familiar&#8211;newsprint and burnt coffee and shoe black from the empty shoeshine chair with its brass footrest and spittoon. Cigar butts in the sand. Like the farmers’ co-op in Needmore. She felt as if she were home.</p>
<p>“Looking for something special?” said the boy behind the counter. He had slick, black hair and a razor beak of a nose.</p>
<p>“Just looking.”</p>
<p>“Let me know you find anything.” He swept a customer’s coins from the counter and into the pocket of his soiled change apron. She was the only woman in this newsstand, but she felt as safe as a doodle bug drawn to its hole. The customers, what few there were, were mostly middle-aged. In the back, an old man wearing a green visor was riffling through sports sections in a stack of regional dailies. His pants were checked, black and white, like his tie.</p>
<p>“First time in Austin?” the boy behind the counter said.</p>
<p>She turned and nodded yes.</p>
<p>“So what do you think?”</p>
<p>“I’m just a freshman. I don’t know.”</p>
<p>He had a loose and easy grin. “It’ll grow on you. Just enjoy yourself. Lot of good food, cheap, if you know where to look. And you’ve got to see the bats.”</p>
<p>Bats? She was thumbing through a house and garden magazine. It’s not that she was interested in houses or gardens, but she didn’t want to give herself away by heading straight for the horoscopes right off. Maybe she’d pick up a news magazine or one of those nifty literary journals with the kaleidoscopic covers. Instead, she bought a pack of Doublemint gum. And then went to the horoscopes. She hadn’t even asked about stationery.</p>
<p>Sagittarius, Gemini, she was searching for Pete’s sign, Scorpio&#8211;“ruled by the groin”&#8211;and hers, Leo&#8211;“find your happiness in caring for others”&#8211;when the customer who had been behind her at the counter while she was buying the gum, a middle-aged man like her father, erect, silent, an automaton, jingled the bell as he opened the door to step into the sun and she looked up and saw a hole open in the back of his suit jacket. The window facing the street shattered, and she crouched to protect her eyes. There was a sound like a backfire from somewhere far off.</p>
<p>“What was that?” the boy behind the counter said. Shards of glass covered everything, but he just stood there, untouched. “What the fuck was that?”</p>
<p>Nobody said anything. JoAnn found herself staring at the floor. She was breathing hard and noticed that the wooden floorboards were discolored, as though they’d been left out in the sun. Nail heads. She was counting the nail heads, and when she realized what she was doing, she stopped.</p>
<p>“Let’s just stay put,” said a voice in the back: the old man, she figured, real calm.</p>
<p>Then for ages, it seemed, there was silence. JoAnn thought she said, ‘Is it okay to look?’ but in retrospect she knew she couldn’t have opened her mouth during that time she was crouched on the floor, at least not until the door bell jingled again, and a student rushed in shouting something about a sniper up on the Tower, shooting, and she felt her heart drop in her chest.</p>
<p>“Yeah, right,” said the boy behind the counter&#8211;he was clearly not from Texas&#8211;and the student grabbed him by the shirt and pulled him face down onto a stack of magazines.</p>
<p>“You don’t believe me, just look outside.”</p>
<p>That’s when she clearly heard gunshots, shouted syllables, voices carried on wind, the sound of sirens, and a rhythmic, raspy breathing, like an animal having a nightmare, but unable to wake itself up.</p>
<p>“Jesus, that guy’s not going to make it,” the student said. More gunshots, steady, methodical. A wail.</p>
<p>JoAnn stood up and looked around. The old man in the green visor motioned for her to get back down, but she didn’t want to, and couldn’t have if she’d tried. She was in one of her waking dreams, a condition her mother had said was all a part of growing up. Barely conscious, she could not be dissuaded by a gesture or word. And in this twilight state, she walked toward the newsstand door. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw the boy with the soiled change apron and the student who had rushed in with news about the sniper. They were huddled together on the floor behind the counter now, two faces that amused her, they were so foreign, so forlorn. When she opened the door, the bell jingled again, and she stepped outside. The wind had picked up, but the sound of gunshots out there on the street seemed remote and inconsequential. She cupped her hand against the glare and smelled the injured man before she saw him. The thought washed over her like shame. He lay collapsed against the bricks, a marionette whose strings had been cut. He was wearing burgundy wingtips and green hourglass socks. He had a stubble of beard, gray sideburns, enormous ears. And the whorl of fine hair at the back of his head reminded her of Red Gillum, a Needmore man who’d been caught siphoning gas from a neighbor’s car. The neighbor had shot him in the hip with a pellet gun, but Red had been able to walk home. This man on the sidewalk in Austin, though, wouldn’t be walking anywhere anytime soon. He was not moving, perhaps not even breathing. Blood puddled beneath his waist and lay smeared across the sidewalk in broad, parallel strokes, as though someone had tried to use a stiff brush to shellac the concrete with blood.</p>
<p>“Please come back inside, Missy.”</p>
<p>She turned.</p>
<p>The old man from the newsstand was holding out his hand, green-veined and shaking, but she took it anyway, and he led her back in with another jingle of the bell, past the boys crouched behind the counter, their mournful eyes, and the stacks and stacks of garden magazines; past the Juicy Fruit and Dentyne displays, the cartons of Camels, Bel Airs, Lucky Strikes. He was taking her deep into the newsstand, where light from a hanging bulb shone green through his visor, and when he at last stopped and let go of her hand, they were standing in a sheltered alcove by the stairs to an upper storeroom. Books of every kind, size, and color surrounded them.</p>
<p>“Now, sit on the steps,” he said. “Do you like music? There’s a radio here. I’ll turn it on. What kind of music do you like? Is this okay?”</p>
<p>She heard the rising of violins, cellos, and the notes of a melody she could almost name; then it came to her, &#8220;Scheherazade,&#8221; by Rimsky-Korsakov, they’d played it at All-State that spring, but behind it were sirens from the street outside. The sound of more gunshots. A scream.</p>
<p>“What was that?” she said, and looked at the old man.</p>
<p>“Just listen to the music,” he replied.</p>
<p>“It was like this, pop, and then another. Pop, pop,” the boy at the counter would say later, and repeat for days after that, years. “Pop. It was like pop.”</p>
<p>“It was like a hammer hitting a nail, like somebody with a hammer,” JoAnn would tell a reporter from the American-Statesman. “Somebody working on a house, you know, a long way off.”</p>
<p>“Did you see the victim before they carried him away?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t see anything. I was on the floor.” She didn’t want to say she had seen the hole open in the man’s back. She didn’t know whether she had actually seen that or not. She particularly didn’t want to say what she had seen on the sidewalk outside. Instead, she looked for the old man in the green visor.</p>
<p>“What about the boy on the bicycle?” the reporter asked.</p>
<p>“What boy?”</p>
<p>“He didn’t make it,” someone beside her said.</p>
<p>“I didn’t see anything,” JoAnn lied. “You’ll have to ask someone else. I really need to go home.”</p>
<p>“Are you a student? Do you know where you are?” This time it was an Austin policeman, and JoAnn was standing in the back of the newsstand drinking a Grapico that the man in the green visor had offered.</p>
<p>“We’re taking you out of here, out the back,” the policeman said. “We think he’s down, but we want to be safe. Come on, sweetie. Step over the glass.”</p>
<p>She squeezed the old man’s hand goodbye&#8211;he had the bluest eyes she’d ever seen&#8211;and followed the policeman down the hall.</p>
<p>This policeman smelled like after shave, a kind she didn’t recognize. It was as though he’d stepped right out of a barber shop, except for the whiff of gasoline, metal, and oil. He had a delicate face, not cop-like at all; he looked like a counselor from the youth camp at Rio Blanco, his lips too big to be pretty, but his skin too fine to be tough, just a youngish man in a gray uniform, leather, a holstered gun.</p>
<p>The sun in the alley out back was way too bright. JoAnn had to put her hand over her eyes to shield them from the glare. And the air smelled like garbage back there. She thought she might, but didn’t, throw up as she walked toward the blue and white patrol car. Something had happened. Of this, she was sure. She didn’t know exactly what it was that had happened, but it was all she could do to convince herself that it hadn’t somehow been&#8211;and this she knew to be ridiculous&#8211;her fault.</p>
<p>On their way to the dorm, the patrol car circled the Tower and South Mall, where a crowd of men and boys milled about with deer rifles and shotguns. They suddenly raised their weapons in unison, and the shouting turned into cheers. But JoAnn didn’t want to see this part of the drama, whatever it was, so she concentrated on a thin smear of something dark and luminous on the dashboard of the patrol car until the cheering receded and the sun came out from behind a building lined with columns and marble statuary&#8211;a courtyard, a garden. Gone.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not so long ago, on the banks of the Mississippi, Charlotte Avery Cole felt a sudden convulsiveness in her breast.  She was terrified.   When she doubled over and began to gag, witnesses thought she might be close to death.   The presence of Alice Night was the proximate cause for the attack.  The true reason was more than fifty years in formation.</p>
<p>It was the fall of 2005:  Charlotte had come to live in the city of New Orleans only a few weeks after The Storm, as natives had started to call it, because its given name was too limited.  The Storm was a process, a lacuna in everyone’s life, a period of wandering, loss, discovery, heat, strangeness, and difficulty in breathing.   It was a walk in the underworld.  The old order did not apply: whole houses had floated off their foundations and now slumped in the middle of the streets; toppled stoplights blinked randomly from the gutter; people burst into tears when asked the simplest questions.  At the time, Charlotte couldn’t have articulated why she decided to dwell in the zone of the disaster.  Her husband claimed she was running away from her <em>real </em>situation.  She would have countered there was nothing <em>real</em> <em>about</em> her situation.</p>
<p>Just before her attack, Charlotte had been sitting on a bench in a park overlooking the Mississippi.  Nearby, on a riverside stage, a “Thanksgiving Concert” had attracted a small, disconsolate crowd.   An R&amp;B singer wore a bright sail of a yellow dress, and a turban&#8212;but her voice was weak, and her band, half missing. The only person in the scene who looked genuinely cheerful, in fact, to Charlotte, was Alice Night, her former tenant.  When she spied her at the edge of the gathering, Charlotte pulled up the hoodie she had taken to wearing in the uncertain streets, and slumped down into the bench, to hide.</p>
<p>She recalled she had once been quite cruel to Alice Night.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Ten years before, Charlotte and her husband, Minton, had bought a house on Esplanade Avenue in New Orleans.  They “inherited” Alice, who was already renting the small studio cottage in the backyard.  Charlotte wanted to evict her immediately but Alice had a good lease.   She also had a boyfriend, Victor, a lanky, curly-haired fellow who could have been cast as Ichabod Crane.  He was pocked-marked, a slob, and divorced.  He had a boy, called “Little Vic,” and custody two weekends a month.  The ex-wife lived in the suburbs and dropped off her son at Alice’s on Fridays, where the boy would wait for his father while Alice fed him cookies.  Victor usually showed up at seven, in time for dinner.</p>
<p>Victor’s ex-wife went to a church so big you could see it from the interstate: a round building with a wriggly spire in the middle like a cocktail swizzle stick.  It remained a going congregation even after its pastor was caught coming out of a motel in broad daylight with a girl who looked fifteen.  The photo was on all the newscasts.</p>
<p>About a month after the scandal broke, the pastor emerged from seclusion to go on TV to confess and cry like a baby.  Many people forgave him but Charlotte would not.  This place, New Orleans, she thought at the time.  Charlotte came from Northern Mississippi where some things went without saying.  In her hometown, the pastor would have had the decency to go away quietly.</p>
<p>The child, Little Vic, who also attended the swizzle stick church, had a morbid fear of several things, among them, sin.  For an eight-year-old, Charlotte thought, he was a nervous wreck. Once, Charlotte and Minton had taken him on a trip with their little girl Belle to a water park&#8211;Minton’s idea.  Charlotte saw this as charity. The boy and Belle went on the huge slide, and not long after, Little Vic said he had to be sick.<br />
“Go ahead,” Minton had told the boy, so did Charlotte.  They brought him into a unisex bathroom, showed him where.</p>
<p>He absolutely would not throw up.  He swallowed, he moaned, he held his mouth tightly closed, turned yellow-green.  He wouldn’t do it.</p>
<p>Finally he turned to Minton and asked to be taken to the gentlemen’s. There, Little Vic confessed that he had done bad things, and now God was punishing him with a bellyache.  He’d taken a crayon from Sunday school.  He had stolen a toy from Belle without even meaning to!  He’d found it in his pocket when he got home!</p>
<p>It was hardly a toy: it was a small, silver horse that had been a piece in a game called <em>Destiny</em> he had played at the backyard picnic table with Belle. <em> Destiny</em> involved advancing pieces around the board, and acquiring things and experiences, and sometimes losing them.   Charlotte had kept it from her own childhood.  It was a precursor to the more popular<em> Careers</em>.  She loved the small silver horse token—whenever she had that, she won, or got the advantage.  If she had the shoe or the train car, she couldn’t be so sure.  Her daughter enjoyed the game as well, and often won, the same as her mother.  There were lots of lucky cards.   The items considered signs of good fortune were spouses, children, homes, high paying or fantastic jobs, fame, wishes unspecified.  A Vacation in Hawaii was one of the very highest prizes.  Now and then, of course, you pulled a card that took everything away.  One said <em>Civil Judgment: Pay DEBT of your whole net worth</em>.  Another, <em>EXTREME PERSONAL REVERSALS:  GIVE all your bounty to the poorest player.</em></p>
<p>One time, in the backyard on Esplanade, when Belle had got the “reversals” card, she burst into tears over the loss of her imaginary assets and threw the silver horse, which was also her favorite token, at Little Vic.  Then, her knee hit the table, accidentally on purpose, disturbing the whole game.  The boy didn’t blame her; in fact, he was just as upset as she was about it.  The game was mean, he said.  Belle shouldn’t have to suffer; she was too pretty, he claimed, as he crawled around, trying to pick all the pieces and paper money out of the grass.  He was distracted by Belle’s distress, and that’s when he’d pocketed the token, the “toy.”</p>
<p>“It was like the Exorcist with this little boy,” Minton said at dinner parties, later, when he talked about that day at the water park.  He liked the story, the incidence of transformation.  In his last attempt at resistance to throwing up, Little Vic had cursed, called Charlotte and Minton filthy names— accused them of having put a “voodoo stinking spell ” on him because they were Catholic, which they weren’t.  Where he got any of this, Minton had no idea, possibly his mother, who was rigidly pious.  But then, after every expletive was spent, after he dug in his pants for the tiny horse, after he tattled on himself in every way, after he threw the token down in a final defiance, the boy finally hurled.</p>
<p>When he emerged from the men’s room with Minton, the child was handsome, serene.  His innocence returned.  It was as if the entire mad tirade had come from a demon he’d purged.  He was a different little boy, after.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>There was a patio in the backyard beside the cottage.  Minton said Alice had a right to use it.  He was a lawyer; he had read the lease.  As long as they had a tenant, they would lose part of the yard.  Charlotte thought a pool would look good right there on that patio:  Alice’s could become a cabana.  Minton didn’t want the attractive nuisance.  Swimming pools and lawsuits were two concepts inextricably linked in his mind.  They fought about it. Charlotte lost.</p>
<p>Alice invariably barbequed when the Victors were visiting.  Charlotte often looked down on them from her kitchen window.  Big Victor never lifted a finger to help.  He just sat at the table and smoked while his son sipped a coke or colored pictures and ate the cookies Alice provided.  On these occasions, Alice usually wore a striped V-neck sundress with short kimono-style sleeves big enough for her thick arms, which emphasized their girth&#8212;a mistake, Charlotte thought.  Alice laughed at whatever inane thing her boyfriend said.  He was an accountant for a small IT business in Metairie.  It was a job to find him interesting, Charlotte believed.  Much less, cook for him and watch his neurotic child while he disappeared for long stretches every weekend, which he invariably did.  He would say he wanted a six-pack of Dixie beer, but he’d be gone for two hours.  From time to time Charlotte considered that Dixie beer was not that rare on Esplanade Avenue&#8211;something was wrong with the picture.</p>
<p>Charlotte thought a great deal about appearances in those days.  All the women she grew up with were concerned with externals&#8211; it was normal.  She was sure there was such a thing as natural beauty.  She thought Alice would get farther with Victor if she didn’t try so hard, or paint her face so much.  She believed Alice had a few good features:  natural auburn hair, with glints, and nice, though narrow, green eyes.  Even if she were eager, Alice should appear indifferent.  But Charlotte couldn’t violate the proper distance between landlady and tenant by giving advice, so her words of wisdom, which were about keeping one’s self aloof, had to be cancelled:  because she believed in them, she couldn’t impart.  Many times in life in those days, actually, Charlotte ran into conundrums like that one.  It made it difficult for her to do things&#8211; work, for example.  She was too good for the jobs she was qualified for, and her station in life made it difficult to learn how to do anything, to start as a lowly beginner.  She was aware of this contradiction but, since she was who she was, she felt she couldn’t do anything about it. It would amount to stooping, coming down from her proper place. And after all, why would she want to be anyone else?  She’d gotten so far in the world being Charlotte Avery Cole.  Except, somehow, it wasn’t enough—secretly, she knew this, but she didn’t know what to do about it.   She had everything she was supposed to want.  She was a bit ashamed she wasn’t happy.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>After they’d been on Esplanade a while, Charlotte started working out with the wives of Minton’s partners, doing spinning and Pilates.  Eventually, she dropped two dress sizes.  She had hoped that would make her feel better.  Then she got the idea of giving her hand-me-down dresses to her tenant&#8211; they were size eights and sixes, very stylish, still.  She came to the door and explained her new regime to Alice&#8211; perhaps she would be inspired?  In a gesture that was threaded through with distance, she handed her old clothes over.  Alice was grateful, and told Charlotte how beautiful she looked lately. Charlotte was elated, for a few minutes.</p>
<p>Minton said it didn’t matter what size Charlotte was, or how she dressed for dinner parties.  Minton didn’t know what was really important, Charlotte didn’t think.  New Orleans wanted something from you.  Drama might be the word for it&#8211; or,<em> performance</em>.  People had the habit once a year of dressing up like characters from their fantasies and parading through the streets in satin masks, with crowns and huge medallions and silly buckled shoes.  Of thinking this was fun, par for the course, when in fact nobody else in the rest of the entire world that Charlotte knew of acted that way. New Orleanians were uniquely showy.</p>
<p>But, when in Rome&#8211; not long after she gave her cast-off garments to Alice, Charlotte bought a new flashy strapless dress to wear to Minton’s law firm’s Twelfth Night functions.  She accessorized with jet beads and thick mascara.  Charlotte was a wide-faced brunette whose looks were much improved by eye makeup, but even when she went all out, plenty of women at the party looked better than she did.  She had to admit it.  In the car, going home, she was disappointed. To make matters worse, that night, Minton told her he was going to Indonesia for three weeks.  Something to do with a company that had hired his firm to work out oil leases.  He said he was sorry; he would miss her and Belle.</p>
<p>The problem with Alice started almost as soon as Minton left.   Deliveries. Lots of them.  Boxes every single day, without respite.  United Parcel Service men ringing and ringing and ringing the doorbell, at all hours, even when Charlotte was in the bath. No matter how she tried to emphasize that Alice’s address was 2942 <em>and a half</em> Esplanade Avenue, the UPS people never understood.  When she got fed up, she descended her back stairs into the yard and banged on her tenant’s door.</p>
<p>After a long time, Alice opened up.  The afternoon deteriorated from there.</p>
<p>The first unpleasant thing Charlotte learned was what the packages held&#8211; semi-precious stones.  Peridots the color of green apple hard candy, sapphires pink as bubblegum. These were set into brooches, pendants and earrings.  Although they were real, they looked fake because the colors had been “enhanced,” under great heat, Alice explained with an enthusiasm Charlotte found unsettling.    But then, with no prompting, Alice announced that she had just received a terrible blow.</p>
<p>She had found pictures under Victor’s side of the bed: Men with dicks the size of&#8211; ears of corn, thick as poles.  She illustrated, pointing to Charlotte’s outdoor umbrella, at the picnic table, which was from William and Sonoma and Charlotte really didn’t want to look at it and think about Victor or his pornography, but she was afraid she would forever after.</p>
<p>Victor, it turned out, had not one male lover, but three.  Counting Alice, he was sleeping with four people.  One he met regularly at a hotel when he took his two-hour trips for Dixie beer.  The other two, he saw at their homes in Metairie.  “Did you know?  Could you tell?  What is wrong with me? Why couldn’t I tell? ” Alice implored, then sobbed.<br />
The things that happened in New Orleans, Charlotte couldn’t help but think.  Then she reminded herself that her father’s name was Harrison William Avery IV, and the town where they lived was named after his great grandfather. There were horses on her property when she was a girl and there were black people in the back in small houses who harvested the pecans when the trees were bearing, and did odd jobs.  The Avery family never went inside these people’s houses, never sat on their porches or patios.  If things like this happened in Averydale the tenants certainly didn’t come and tell you about it, or show you the size of the organs of other parties.</p>
<p>“So he says, he only has sex with me and these three boyfriends. That was how he was looking out for me.  Looking out for me!” Alice’s small, plump lips were a perfect upside down “U.”  She put her head down and shook with sorrow. “You should have seen his face.  Glad to get this off his chest!”</p>
<p>Charlotte had to pat Alice, of course, when she heard this thing.  She sat there for a certain amount of time because she had been raised a Christian, but she got away as quickly as she could.</p>
<p>The next ten days&#8211; with Minton on the other side of the world&#8211; Charlotte felt as if she had a bomb waiting to explode in the back yard.  The brown boxes were still coming, two a day.  Alice was up all night, running the air conditioner and the TV.   Sometimes Charlotte could hear the announcers. “<em>Candy Tourmaline Puzzle Rings, Azurite Pendants Special Value Two Left</em>.” Alice started going to work wearing false eyelashes, garish lipstick, low cut sweaters, as well as the gaudy jewelry.  She dyed her nice hair garish copper. When speaking to anyone, including the UPS man, she was very loud, as if she were yelling over music in a bar.  Charlotte hid in her house, afraid of hearing more revelations about Alice’s love life, or Victor’s.  She told herself Minton would know how to approach this, and counted the hours until his return.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“You mean I should ask her if she will see a shrink?” he said when Charlotte finally picked him up at the airport.</p>
<p>Charlotte explained that she’d decided Alice was in a hypomanic state and was going to crash.  She’d seen this on a program on PBS and it fit perfectly: the erratic behavior, the grandiose ideas, the inability to sleep, the shopping sprees, and the makeup.  But that wasn’t all that concerned her.  She told him to ask their tenant one particular question.</p>
<p>At that, Minton gave her a look she recognized.  He used it when he was taking a deposition and expected an answer from the person and instead had gotten what he considered gobbledygook.  He jutted out his chin, his eyes slanted harshly.  But he didn’t say he was disappointed.  In the past, he would have.  It was peculiar, she noted, that this time he didn’t.</p>
<p>As soon as he put down his luggage, Minton dutifully went and knocked on Alice’s door.  She appeared, wearing one of Charlotte’s knits, which fit her.  She was also holding a mint julep.  She explained to Minton she was taking off work because there was a special, <em>Fabulous Opals of Australia.</em></p>
<p>Minton patiently led her to the picnic table.  He asked her about things in general terms.  Charlotte listened from her kitchen window.</p>
<p>After a few pleasantries, Alice volunteered, at the top of her lungs, “You heard he was three-timing me? With boys! Don’t matter, I have a ton of dates.”</p>
<p>Charlotte believed all the dates were in Alice’s head.</p>
<p>Minton asked her if buying all the jewelry was a good idea with her bills.  She answered she needed to dress up because of her new boyfriends.   And then he said, “About that&#8211;” Dutifully, he asked Charlotte’s question.</p>
<p>Abruptly, Alice shifted from effusive joy to desolation, like a scene-stealing actress. “Yes! Yes I did! It was horrible to have to do it!”</p>
<p>The whole thing was so tawdry, Charlotte felt, though she was relieved.  And all in her very own backyard.</p>
<p>After a certain amount of time watching her husband with her tenant, however, she became a little jealous.  She could not remember the last time Minton had listened to her an hour plus, straight.  She had problems, too, besides having a crazy backyard neighbor.</p>
<p>She had starved herself down to a size four but her husband still didn’t notice, or think it mattered.   It would be hard to get sympathy for that from Minton, she allowed. Their daughter Belle was a sullen child, who thought the world positively owed her, and she was difficult in school, that was another.  Charlotte knew Minton thought this was their fault.  She was an only, they spoiled her.  In New Orleans it was hard for Charlotte to make friends, people were too blatant, she could never keep up.  This, she knew, was difficult for Minton to grasp, as he was a native of the city.  But he did know she didn’t have that many people she could confide in.  In fact, she had nobody.  But then, confiding was not how she was brought up.  She was brought up to wait until someone figured out something was bothering her, and came to help.  She was brought up to expect, not to explain.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Minton’s conversation with Alice proved the turning point.</p>
<p>Eventually the jewelry deliveries slowed down to twice a week, then once.  Alice cut out the makeup, buttoned up her blouses and sweaters, and stabilized.  As soon as Charlotte could forget about her tenant almost completely, it became a pleasant spring.  May, Minton went to Jakarta again. When he came home this time, he brought lots of gifts.  Silks, gold jewelry, beaded belts, carved figurines, toys for Belle, and silver slippers that curled up at the toe. “For the Princesses,” he said, and pecked the two of them on their almost-identical cheeks.</p>
<p>When Charlotte wore her Indonesian gifts, which were exotic and much more interesting than the things Alice bought off the TV, she reminded herself how fortunate she must seem to Alice, having a man like Minton, a beautiful daughter, and not having to work, and, to top it all off, recently, a very good figure. When Charlotte looked at her life from the imaginary point of view of someone like Alice, who had been used in such an ugly way, by a liar&#8211; she could see, in theory, how happy and lucky she must seem.  But the fact was, Charlotte was miserable that whole year and it was just getting worse.</p>
<p>This was perverse.  Minton was good to her, better than ever.  He never crossed her anymore.  Every time he came back from Indonesia he was kinder to her than before.</p>
<p>If Alice had my life, my status, she would enjoy it, Charlotte thought in those days.   Charlotte herself couldn’t get any pleasure out of life.  Sometimes she would, for an instant, envy Alice; because she seemed to genuinely have high regard for her and for Minton, for their fortunate lives.  But then, Charlotte would come to full consciousness, and feel awful, for having to prop up a straw admirer.  She didn’t even know how to tell this to the psychiatrist she had started to see.  It was so complex. To be envious of someone whose life was so paltry&#8211; because she’d be able to enjoy yours!</p>
<p>Finally, that summer, when Minton was on his last trip to Jakarta, Charlotte decided to explain it to the doctor, for he wasn’t very good at reading her.  She had to come right out and say it: things that happened to her, including the best of things, were as if full of holes.  Feeling passed right through her.  Nothing stuck.  There was no solid thing inside her&#8211; she had no core, she felt.  Sometimes she envied people who were miserable, especially people who were miserable because of things that happened to them or that they did and couldn’t help.  At least they had feelings that had good reasons behind them.  In this respect, also, she envied Alice, out there at the picnic table that day with Minton, her face beet red, her tears freely flowing, mascara spots on her cheeks. Why?  For her concrete unhappiness.  To have an undeniable, unmediated feeling for a cause of any kind was a state to be desired.  She was actually saying this to the doctor, even though she found it a great nuisance to have to, when he stopped her in the middle and said that this session would be their last unless she wanted to start paying full freight.  Her husband’s insurance was not going to cover anymore, unless he entered a false diagnosis, which he didn’t want to do.  Charlotte suspected that the psychiatrist didn’t believe there was anything really wrong with her.  Or worse, he just didn’t like her enough to sit with her week after week.  He told her he was putting her on Prozac.  Charlotte left, like that, with just a piece of paper, a prescription, and no sympathy.  The whole experience was humiliating.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>In fact, she and Alice were on the same dose of antidepressants, she was embarrassed to learn that next winter, when Alice came in the kitchen one afternoon to deliver the rent, and saw Charlotte’s bottle.  She commented that she had been on 20 milligrams, but lately she’d started cutting her pills in half. What did Charlotte think?</p>
<p>&#8220;Who did Alice think she was?&#8221; was what Charlotte thought.  But at the same time she felt a rather alien impulse&#8211; she actually wanted to tell Alice what she’d been to the doctor for, the things he wouldn’t wait to hear.  She turned around and opened her mouth&#8211; all she felt, all that was lacking in her life, the things the Prozac couldn’t get to, the great bulb of sorrow that was in her breast.  She was just about to do it, but then she remembered she couldn’t.  It wasn’t in her nature.  Alice was just a tenant.  How would it look?</p>
<p>“It was good of you to lend me your husband that afternoon,” Alice said, “back when I found out about Victor, and got so crazy.”   She flashed a simple smile&#8211; intimate, almost.</p>
<p>Charlotte didn’t smile back.</p>
<p>Not long after, Charlotte told Minton it was “time to take over the yard.” He complied. It was the Jakarta principle.  Whenever Minton came back from Indonesia, he would do everything she asked, he never argued anymore.  Charlotte thought maybe it was just that they had more money.  That winter he didn’t say a word when she evicted Alice.  Alice said she was going to live in an efficiency near her Aunt Nancetta in the Garden District, the extremely old lady Alice escorted to Sunday brunch at Galatoire’s once a week.  Though she was rich as Croesus, she always made Alice pay for her own meal.  Alice’s life was in tatters, in Charlotte’s view.  She was over thirty-five.  She was going to be an old maid, looking after that nasty woman, right on out to the end.</p>
<p>The morning she left, Alice came to the back door and Charlotte feared a confrontation, but instead Alice said, “I’ll miss you.” Her eyes seemed larger than usual, greener, prettier, liquid.  For a brief moment Charlotte considered what it might be like to feel the same way.</p>
<p>The men came to dig the pool the next day.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Two years later, Charlotte tried another request out on Minton.  Could they move to Bay St. Louis, on the coast of Mississippi, leave New Orleans?  She was tired of the stress of the city.  In Mississippi she would feel more at home.  She was a native, after all.</p>
<p>Minton said okay, sure.  They built a mansion in Bay St. Louis right on the Gulf Coast and bought a boat.  He commuted to work in the city.  She saw him less, but they were very rich at that point, and the general consensus among the people they met in Bay St. Louis was that wealth made up for everything that could be wrong.  They lived like that for five years&#8211; Charlotte drank a bit more, got slightly fat around the middle, and tried to enjoy her abundant life, even went to church and prayed she could be in the moment, and live, somehow, and not be always looking around for someone else to envy her, or tell her how wonderful she was.  Her prayers were not answered.</p>
<p>Then, when she was fifty-six and had just returned from taking her daughter to a special college with a lot of rules in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, Charlotte sat down on her beautiful gallery in Mississippi overlooking the Gulf.  It was a late night in August.   The man on the radio told people to evacuate the coast. She got up and did the minimal packing, then made her way to their tiny cabin on Bayou Sara north of Baton Rouge.  She waited there for Minton, who was in Tulsa on a case.  The next night, The Storm visited.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Minton had trouble getting back from Oklahoma.  The New Orleans airport had been turned into a hospital, he couldn’t fly into it. No other airport in Louisiana or Texas had any rental cars to use when he landed.  He eventually leased a Suburban and drove all night to get to Charlotte.  The next day he’d made his way to Bay St. Louis to see the devastation.  Seventy-two hours later, he pulled up in the huge, muddied vehicle, and parked, but didn’t come in.  Charlotte watched him from the picture window.  She was afraid to go out and greet him.  Finally, he climbed out of the car holding a single plastic grocery bag, and made his way to the porch.  He was slow, stiff, and eerie.  Inside, he went directly to the kitchen counter, and removed the contents of the little bag:  a bottle  of Gatorade with a fifth of Vodka.  He poured them together into a pitcher.  The first words he uttered were, “The guy at the convenience store in what used to be Gulf Port told me about this.   You call it `St. Petersburg.’  Get it, Florida—Gators, Russia.”</p>
<p>She couldn’t laugh.</p>
<p>He showed her pictures on his digital camera.  Only wreckage, nothing left. The ocean could swallow something as big as their mansion and a boat house, and not even spit a little bit of it back.   How would it be possible to have a life if this could happen to it?  Nobody had ever told her about disaster.  All that was left of that entire existence was one tiny thing, he said.</p>
<p>Over a period of about an hour and a half, Minton drank a great deal of St. Petersburg.  Charlotte refused to join him.</p>
<p>Then, all of a sudden, his face buckled, so he looked a little like the minister of the swizzle stick church years ago, and he said, “You know what? I’m relieved it’s all gone.  I feel better than I have in years.  I am thankful.  Hah!”</p>
<p>Then he told her he once loved another woman. Her name was Salma.  This was in Jakarta, when he’d travelled there, ten years before.</p>
<p>Charlotte was astounded.  She had lived through the parts of life that were supposed to make you a tough bird&#8211;Belle’s hellish middle school years, a breast cancer scare.  But this, she had never expected.  “What kind of name is Salma?”  Was all she said.</p>
<p>“She was Indonesian. Daughter of&#8211;” he paused, shook his head violently, like someone getting rid of a bee in his ear.  “I don’t want to get into all of it.  I refuse to tell you.  And I only slept with her once!   I wanted to a thousand times.  Since The Storm, I think of her constantly.  Up in Tulsa, the night it came in, I dreamed I was in her arms.  <em>Her</em> arms.”  He threw his head back.</p>
<p>Charlotte looked at his throat.  She didn’t know what to say.</p>
<p>“In fact, now, the truth is, I am so fucking sorry I did come back to you.  What do you think of that?  I thought of it all the way back here from the coast.  I should have gone to her. All I have to deal with, why is this the only thing I’m thinking of?  How crazy am I?” His head wasn’t nodding exactly; it was bobbing around, weaving, as if he couldn’t decide whether these comments deserved a nod or a shake.</p>
<p>“This affair was years ago? What did she look like?”</p>
<p>“That is just what you would say.  What did she look like.  I knew it.  That’s so <em>you</em>, Charlotte.”  His head moved even more wildly.  “It wasn’t a full blown affair.  I was too guilty.  Afternoons in the city, tea, coffee.  Just one night in the International Hotel.”  His chin was finally still.  He glared.  “You would beat her in a beauty contest.  But she was a human being.”</p>
<p>Why did he say his Indonesian girlfriend was a human being?</p>
<p>“Remember Alice? When she had that break up with that fool Victor?  I had just come back for the first time when that happened.  I was smitten with Salma.   But I was determined to be the good husband.  I was happy to see you, to start all over with you.” At this point Minton touched his heart and Charlotte was acutely aware that he had one.  He was a creature, with internal organs, and very liquid, deep, desires, not a man in a seersucker suit in an air-conditioned office, or in boxer shorts and knee socks, which is how she usually thought of him. “Remember, you picked me up at the airport, and you told me all about Alice? How that guy hurt her&#8211; and all you could think about was did she have AIDS?  Had she been tested?  You just didn’t know how to say you were sorry for her &#8211;I told myself that.  But I think I gave you too much credit.”</p>
<p>“Why are you telling me now?” Charlotte said in a very tiny voice.</p>
<p>“Because!” he said.  “That life we led there, that whole life we had—whether I wanted it or you wanted it or if it was for Belle, or to show your father some damn thing&#8211;it doesn’t matter now, because it’s gone.  And we have to start another.  A person has to ask himself:  Do I want it all back?” He shook his head. “Because it’s gonna be years, hell, to get it back.  Have you seen what I’m talking about?   It’s a huge job.  There <em>is</em> no Bay St. Louis.  There is hardly much New Orleans.  Maybe I’m not a good man.  My father was a good man.  He took such a job and never laid down the burden. But you know what? I want Salma.  I want to be happy.  I don’t want to prove myself.  I don’t want to go back to Bay St. Louis.  I don’t even know if I want to live with you.  She had a soul. I saw it. It was obvious.”</p>
<p>His chin was trembling.  It was a confession&#8211; so messy, so disturbing, she thought.</p>
<p>“How can I spend the rest of my days?  Playing Princess and the Pea with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Furious, Charlotte thought to herself, is that what I am, furious?  No, that isn’t it.  What is it?  A voice in her said, <em>Leave. </em> At the same time she had never known so much longing for Minton, not since she was in her twenties.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The next day, she said she couldn’t stay with him in the cabin.</p>
<p>“Where are you going to go?” he asked.  The flatness in his tone was very new.</p>
<p>“New Orleans.”</p>
<p>“It is dangerous, have you any idea? You can’t even get in&#8211; can’t drink the water&#8211;”</p>
<p>She knew those were lies.  The National Guard were lax at some checkpoints.  You could get in.  She’d read there were ten thousand souls in the city, aid workers, people who refused to leave, hangers on, thrill-seekers, even.  She suddenly wanted to be there, wanted to see it, to study it up close, watch and look and listen.  She didn’t even know why.</p>
<p>“Are you off your rocker?” he asked her, but he didn’t seem to have the slightest interest in stopping her.  She found that remarkable, but in a way she was pleased he was consistent.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>In New Orleans in early October, if you came up to a stranger on the street, and said,  <em>How</em><em> did you make out?&#8211;</em> you might be held for an hour.   Some were outrageously generous, others, gross and frank, insulting.  In every coffeehouse or open restaurant several operas were going on at once&#8211; multiple casts exploding with soliloquies and arias.  People were on their cell phones, screaming at insurance adjusters, or pleading with dead beat roofers, or weeping about their losses, or bragging about how they intimidated looters, drove through Uptown with a cocked pistol, stole drugs or water&#8211;did things they had never believed they would do.  Nothing was normal: for this she was grateful.   She never told her story.  Not once.  It wasn’t much, in a way, compared to what she overheard.  But she was devastated.  She didn’t listen to many people directly, she found it too wrenching.  She eavesdropped, she lurked, she stepped around the stinking piles of debris, the darkened houses, crossed the street when she saw clusters of National Guardsmen.  The misery was general, widespread, though unevenly, distributed.  She knew she ought to find some way to help&#8211; but she hadn’t gotten around to it.</p>
<p>Occasionally, Minton texted her. “U R so fck*g impn*trable. Where R U? Shit to sign!” This was about insurance.</p>
<p>She was living in a former slave quarters in the backyard of the house of one of Belle’s old schoolmates’ mothers.  There was water and gas, intermittent electricity.  The landlady wasn’t permanently back&#8211; she just visited now and then, and sat on the front porch in a stupor, mumbling about how much had to be done and how she couldn’t manage it.  The house had not flooded, but there was roof damage, mold.  She was ignorant of Charlotte’s situation, except that she was aware she’d lived on the Mississippi coast.  Now and then she’d come up to her and say, “You poor thing, you poor thing, I can’t imagine what you are going through&#8211;” then she’d ride off in her Volvo.</p>
<p>Charlotte liked her life sometimes.  It was quite easy, actually, if you lived in two hundred and ninety square feet: you moved from kettle to table to bed by just turning around.  No need to hike past all your silver and your mother’s china and your puddled drapes and traipse through dining rooms and front parlors possibly no one had ever used.  She had only one trinket that linked her to her former life.  It was in her pocket.  She touched it several times a day, a talisman when she was coursing through the littered streets.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>This was the state of things that November day at the Thanksgiving concert.  Charlotte was still slumped down and hiding in her hoodie when Alice Night recognized her and marched up.  Alice’s hair was its original auburn now.  She wore a very expensive looking leather jacket with whip-stitched lapels.</p>
<p>Charlotte showed her face, decided to go first.  “Alice!  How did you make out?”</p>
<p>Her former tenant went through the basics:  She had stayed through The Storm; neither her apartment nor Aunt Nancetta’s house around the corner had flooded.  Her aunt had been in a nursing home following a fall at the time.  Tuesday after, Alice took a boat from a friend’s yard with her neighbor Andy who worked for the TV station.  He had a shotgun and a good camera; he needed to check on his sister, who turned out to be fine. They also were curious to see it all.  They took Bayou St. John for a while and then went over to Jefferson Parish.  For a few days, they ferried people out of Mid-City, then went back for dogs and cats.  Somewhere during the second week, they fell in love. She kept calling her aunt’s caretakers&#8211; finally, finally, they called back and said the lady had a fatal stroke while they were trying to evacuate her to Alexandria.  She went peacefully: ninety-seven years old.  Alice was going to end up with the house,  “Me, a grand dame on Harmony Street, who would have thought it?  I go back to that time when I lived behind you, going with that jerk Victor.  Everything is so turned around now.”  She had a sweet, small smile, like a girl.  “How about this:  I’m engaged for the first time in my life!”</p>
<p>Charlotte remembered how she used to stand in her kitchen and consider Alice’s meager existence so she herself could feel a little better.  Then, in an instant, Charlotte  glimpsed how everything her husband had said was not an exaggeration, not the wailing of a lovesick crazy man&#8211; but completely true.  Charlotte was cold.  She was aloof. She didn’t have feelings, or if she did, she didn’t feel them.  Her soul, if she had one at all, he said, was buried deep, deep under rubble.</p>
<p>She looked into Alice’s green eyes and saw not even a shred of cruelty.  She looked for it, that shred&#8211; she looked and looked.</p>
<p>“I made out so well&#8211; I almost feel guilty&#8211; It was Nancetta’s time, it’s okay.  You?”</p>
<p>What would that be like, Charlotte was thinking.   To not have that place, preferably in the center of the room, where you are waiting, for everybody else to get it.  Who you are.  What you want.  What you feel.  They were supposed to get it, because her life was large and everybody was always looking.  She had always had that, from the time she was a little girl.  What would it be like not to have it?  But it wasn’t a hypothetical:  it was real&#8211; she didn’t have anyone to wait upon her, anymore.  Not at all.  Alice was standing there, but she wasn’t going to stand there long, or guess.  Could she  just come out with it, the way other people did.  In the abstract, it felt like an adventure, but Charlotte was not adventurous.  Or, at least in the past, she had not been adventurous.</p>
<p>Alice sat down beside her, wanting to be kind, to listen, said, “You and Minton?”</p>
<p>And Charlotte realized she might have to actually speak.</p>
<p>Back, weeks back, when they had their last face to face argument, she had sat silent at one end of the rustic table in the Bayou Sara cabin looking at her husband,  and thought,<em> I am not angry, I am in shock</em>.  Finally she said to her husband, “Look at me. Look at me.  Please.”   It was agony to beg.  If he had stabbed her, it would have been less painful.  The fact that he didn’t look back hurt nowhere near as much as having to beg him to do it.   Eventually she had to come round and get down on her knees to see his eyes, to gaze up at him.</p>
<p>His face was so unused to showing anger it was perfectly distorted.  A Minton she didn’t know. “Look what I found,” he told her when she cowered beneath him. “It was in the hollow of a fallen tree where our driveway used to be.  That’s all that’s left of Bay St. Louis. It’s yours, take it, you always won with it&#8211; rather come out on top than &#8211;” A wide rush of air passed through his nostrils, the opposite of a snort.  He threw down the tiny object. “Anything.” He walked out of the room.</p>
<p>Charlotte picked it up.   It was hard and very old, the silver paint very chipped.  It was rearing back on two legs&#8211; a thing the Tennessee Walker horses in the barn in the back of her daddy’s land did when something really startled them.  When they were utterly terrified.  She had never thought of that before.  They were so scared.</p>
<p>”Minton and me&#8211;” she was planning to tell Alice that they were okay, but the house in Bay St. Louis was gone.  She never told the whole truth, not to anybody.  Even to the shrink, she lied.   But then, she felt something in her chest, a big dark hot ball, getting bigger, and bigger&#8211;</p>
<p>“Minton and &#8211;” she began again.</p>
<p>“Yeah, you and Minton?” Alice asked, her smile loosening with concern&#8211;</p>
<p>Charlotte couldn’t speak.  She meant to, but she couldn’t.  She thought she might be having a heart attack.</p>
<p>She flashed on a memory, which gave her slight solace: her husband that day in the water park with Little Vic.  She saw how gently he bent down to comb the boy’s damp hair with a black plastic sixty-nine-cent comb that seemed meant only for such difficult moments, for combing the hair of children who have found themselves in some terribly upsetting predicament, whose faces had to be washed by a stranger.  She had never thought of it before, not really&#8211; how tender Minton could be.  She had to swallow to go on.</p>
<p>Uncanny, actually&#8211; she retained a certain level of objectivity about the pending explosion inside her, at least for the first few seconds.  But then it started to come to life&#8211; a great, untamed being within her, ranging around, demanding to be let out.  This was  like the moment right before giving birth.  She realized even greater pain was coming; there was no stopping it.  She just had to let it.  Oh she hated this feeling.  The horse, the horse&#8211;</p>
<p>“Miss Charlotte.  How bad could it be? What is it? What happened?” Alice asked, thinking she’d never seen such a twisted expression on a sane woman, “What happened to Minton?  Did he&#8211;?”</p>
<p>Charlotte shook her head violently, and doubled over, then she raised her left hand&#8211;something was in that left hand.  She was either going to knock Alice Night down with her sharp, hard fist  and then stand up to trample her, or she was going to hurl that little horse out into the waters, and spill her story, let it all go, all of it, and all, all, all that went with it, a whole way of carrying on in life.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Somebody put the baby in Medora’s lap, and a crowd of people gathered at her elbows, as if she might forget – after six babies, nineteen grandchildren, and a horde of great-grandchildren – as if she might forget how to hold a baby. She leaned back to let the baby roll in, the round head coming to rest between her breast and her shoulder, her right arm drawn across the small body. The eyelids were still thick and red with the sleep of the womb, the head warped from the pressure of birth.</p>
<p>“Granny,” said one of the fluttering crowd, “this is your first great-great-granddaughter. She’s named Medora, for you.”</p>
<p>Medora held the baby for a while, and people took pictures. Then the mother – her great-granddaughter Anne – took the little Medora away, and most of the young people left, taking most of the children. They would come back later, with birthday cake. Anne stayed, putting the baby in a complicated stroller that looked as if it could fly to the moon.</p>
<p>“My mom’s gone to get your cake,” Anne said. “With one hundred and six candles.”</p>
<p>“I don’t feel a day over ninety.” Medora had made the same joke on her birthday ever since she turned eighty, and Anne laughed respectfully, as they all did. This was one of the advantages of being old.</p>
<p>“What’s the first thing you remember?” Anne asked. A week didn’t go by without somebody asking this: that was a disadvantage.</p>
<p>“The day of the big dinosaur hunt,” Medora said, and Anne laughed again, with the same dutiful respect; but it was a lie. The first thing Medora remembered was the day she was named.</p>
<p>It was summer, a brown summer, the sky blazing blue every day, and thunderstorms that turned the air inside out. The latch on the gate was broken, and she swung on it, pushing herself back with her feet, and then tilting her body forward until the gate clashed shut and the broken latch rattled. The dog lay in the shade, the cats had disappeared into their own private worlds, the older sisters went here and there about their work, and Senor Alvarez paraded his biddies into the yard and kept them all in an anxious chattering group, rushing at them if any tried to escape. Every time they came near the gate, she slammed it shut. They clucked at her and scattered, and Senor Alvarez flamed his red crest, puffed his purple throat, and darted around the yard, gathering them together. She had a handful of chickenfeed in her pocket, and whenever Senor Alvarez let his biddies rest, she would fling out a few grains to fuss them up again.</p>
<p>Big sister Margaretta came through the yard with a basket of wet sheets and said, “Baby, you quit agitating them fowl, they’ll drop dead in this heat.” Baby waited until Margaretta had gone around the house, and then she threw out another handful of feed.</p>
<p>The road was so hot, the air boiled and shook. There was a line of purple in the air, like the brightest color in Senor Alvarez’s throat. The purple line thickened into a tall blue smudge, and the smudge wobbled, twisted, came nearer without apparently moving, and suddenly a man stood on the road, just outside the gate. He wore a gray suit and gray shoes, and his hair was the same gray, smooth and rich, like a leather cap.</p>
<p>“I need to know your name,” he said. A hot, soft smell came off him: peaches brown with rot, a smell full of wasps. “I need to know who you are,” he said.</p>
<p>Baby slammed the gate. She wished that she hadn’t broken the latch, but it was too late now. She backed away from the gate and dropped a handful of chickenfeed at her feet, while the biddies gathered around her in a fluttering noisy mass, and Senor Alvarez rushed at them, enraged.</p>
<p>The broken gate swung away from the gray man’s hand, and he came into the yard. “I’m the census taker,” he said. “I need to take everybody’s name. Is this the Lake family home?”</p>
<p>Baby shook her head. Another big sister came out of the house, flapping her skirt at the biddies. “Baby, they’ll kill each other if you don’t spread the feed,” she scolded.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Lake,” the gray man said. Baby wrinkled her nose at the smell of hot fruit.</p>
<p>“No. I’m Annie. Mama’s poorly.”</p>
<p>“Miss Lake, I’m the census taker. I need to know how many people live here, and their names and ages.”</p>
<p>And big sister Annie stood there and told the gray man their names, everybody’s name from old Grampa Buford down to the smallest big sister Tommie, “and this is the baby,” Annie finished.</p>
<p>“I need her real name.”</p>
<p>“We just call her Baby. We’ve run out of girl names.”</p>
<p>It was true. The older sisters had two or three names each, Margaretta June and Catherine Electa and Ava Birdie Pernel, and even Annie, the seventh, was Coral Anne Bella; but the tenth and eleventh were Johnnie and Tommie with no middle names, and Baby, the youngest, had no name at all at four years old.</p>
<p>“She needs a name,” the gray man said. “I can give her one.”</p>
<p>Baby did not need a name. In particular, she did not want one given her by the gray man who had walked out of the boiling air. She tugged big sister Annie’s skirt and whispered, “No, no, no,” but Annie paid no attention.</p>
<p>“Elinor,” the gray man said.</p>
<p>“No,” Baby said.</p>
<p>“I’ll go in and ask Mama,” Annie said, and she walked away, leaving Baby with the gray man.</p>
<p>“You go away,” she said. “You go right away from here.”</p>
<p>“You can’t go on with not having a name. Everybody has to have a name, and yours is Elinor.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want it.”</p>
<p>Senor Alvarez finally realized that the chickenfeed was in Baby’s pocket. This came as a puzzle and a surprise to him every day. He dashed at his biddies, driving them away from Baby, and strutted before her, flourishing his wings and crying urgent musical half-crows. He was a magnificent rooster, jeweled like a dragon, and when he stood tall, his crest came to Baby’s shoulder. She had raised him from a new-hatched chick, a ball of brown and gold fluff as light as a captured breath. He pranced before her, then lowered his head and snaked it at the gray man with a furious hiss.</p>
<p>The gray man took a step back, but he said, “It’s your name now, yours forever.”</p>
<p>“No, no, no!” Baby shrieked. She hurled a double handful of chickenfeed over the gray man’s shoes, and Senor Alvarez and all the biddies mobbed him in a mass. He kicked out and shouted as they drove him to the gate and out into the road.</p>
<p>“Goodbye, Elinor,” he called.</p>
<p>By the time Annie came out to say that their mother thought Elinor was a beautiful name as long as it was Christian, he was gone, a blue flicker drawn back into the shaking air. Senor Alvarez lay dead, his feathers as bright as ever but his bright black eyes fading, his neck broken by a kick from the gray shoes. “Nothing wrong with this bird that three hours in the pot can’t mend,” Annie said. She took him inside to clean and pluck him, leaving Baby, now Elinor, to feed the fowl.</p>
<p>One hundred and two years ago that was, and she had never seen anything as red as that rooster’s crest. The century passed like the shadow of a hawk over a field. She’d never told the story to her children or grandchildren, but maybe it was time to tell it, maybe to this great-granddaughter Anne, named for the big sister who’d been dead herself for seventy years. Maybe to the young man who came around the facility sometimes with his camera, asking the old people questions about what it was like when they were young.</p>
<p>“When I was young,” she’d told him last time, “I didn’t know how happy I was. I didn’t know how good it feels to be healthy and strong. I could walk wherever I wanted. I could trust my bones.” He’d laughed and agreed with her; the young did not appreciate their youth. She shook her head at him. He was only fifty and numbered himself already among the old. He’d never make his century. She didn’t want to talk to him again, not even to tell him the story of Senor Alvarez and the gray man, because she wasn’t old. She had lived a hundred and two years since that day, but she was still that nameless child, Baby swinging on the broken gate, flying through the thundery air.</p>
<p>She must have slept, one of those soft light sleeps that came to her sometimes. She didn’t feel them at all. She felt only that a screen had flicked before her eyes, and the people around her changed. This was a new kind of sleep, odd and frightening, and she hadn’t told any of her doctors about it yet; but the room was full of relatives again, and one of the children had found her remote control and turned on the television. Cartoons. Talking cars that turned into robots. One of her great-grandsons had taken her out to buy shoes last week, and his car spoke to him and told him where to drive. “Soon they’ll be driving themselves,” she’d said. When it was time to park, he showed her how he could let go of the wheel and it parked itself. She’d thought she was joking, but it was real. “Does it fly?” she asked, half serious.</p>
<p>Long ago when she was Baby, and slightly less long ago when she was Elinor Lake, her father came home drunk and sleeping on the mule’s back and the mule would take itself into the barn. A hundred years later, and the smartest cars around still weren’t as smart as a good mule. She might tell that to the young man from the university, the next time he came.</p>
<p>“Turn that off, Justin,” Anne said. Medora thought Justin was Anne’s little brother, but maybe they were cousins; she could never be sure about the great-grandchildren.</p>
<p>“That’s all right, I like it,” Medora said. She patted the arm of her chair. “Come and tell me what’s happening. Is that a bad guy?”</p>
<p>“That’s the good guy. His name’s Optimus Prime.”</p>
<p>Medora let the child rattle on. It made a nice change, to have so many people in the room, so many of the little ones all at once. They could play with each other or watch the television together, instead of fidgeting and yawning and looking at her, wondering what was the use of coming to see their great-grandmother and how long their parents would make them stay. Medora was still thinking about the car that parked itself. She watched the show with little Justin for a few minutes, and said, “They must get terrible gas mileage.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Look at the size of them. And all those weapons. Walking around on robot feet like that, it’s not very efficient, there’s a reason we use wheels. Who pays for their gas? Do robots have credit cards?”</p>
<p>“They’ve got an alien power source,” Justin explained.</p>
<p>“It must be nice to be some people,” she grumbled.</p>
<p>Justin was – how old? She rubbed his soft brown hair – probably about ten. By the time she was his age, she was used to being called Elinor, but deep down, there was always a sparkle of Baby, an instant response no whenever she heard her name. When she was sixteen, all grown up though younger than great-granddaughter Anne was today, that sparkle had driven her off the farm, all the way to the big city. San Antonio. And there she had met Willson Fennick, who had a kind of sparkle too, or at least he had very shiny hair, and such clean white hands. There was a man who’d never slopped a pig. Oh, how she loved him. It was 1922, and she cut her hair short and wore dresses that made Grampa Buford call her the spawn of Jezebel, when she went back to the farm for the quilts she had sewn as a child; her gold bangles were pinchbeck, but her rings were real diamonds.</p>
<p>She was Elinor Fennick. Elinor Lake died at the door of the farmhouse, murdered in Grampa Buford’s mouth. Dead to me. Dead to this family forever. Harlot. Elinor Fennick bleached her brown hair gold and painted her mouth. Willson was a clerk at South Pacific and they lived in a little house near Sunset Station, and the money that flowed through that house was incredible, terrifying. He was a good card player as long as he was winning. He won for four years. But then he started to lose. He lent money and couldn’t get it back. He borrowed money and couldn’t pay it back.</p>
<p>He came home drunk, and in the mornings the twenty-year-old Elinor, with baby Mariana on her hip, told him what he had done the previous night. If he won a little, she told him he’d lost. If he won more, she gave him half the money.</p>
<p>On the farm, her education had been a haphazard effort by the big sisters, with occasional bouts of rigorous Bible study with Grampa Buford. Now she paid a neighbor to watch Mariana while she took business classes, learned typing and shorthand. She took Willson’s winnings and bought diamond rings, although she told him they were rhinestones; she replaced her pinchbeck bangles with real gold. She rolled twenty-dollar bills into the smallest possible pellets and sewed them into Mariana’s blanket, disguising the stiffness with embroideries of bright purple feathers. When she walked, her strong young feet pushed her up into a skipping half-run, and in the storm of her fears and her worries and her plans, she did not know that she was happy.</p>
<p>Willson lost, borrowed money, lost again. Men came to the little house, looking for money. She always kept a few dollars in the sugar jar. They followed the nervous glance of her eyes, dumped the sugar onto her kitchen floor, and took the money. Then she swept up the dirty sugar and poured it back into the jar with another five or ten dollars hidden in it. She kept clean sugar in a paper bag in a drawer. As long as she lived in her own home, until she was ninety-seven, she had the habit of keeping a jar of sugar on the counter but never using it.</p>
<p>One thundery day, she sat in her kitchen with all the windows open, hoping for some air. Mariana, two years old, was fussy with the heat and teething; she sat under the kitchen table, gnawing on a carrot. Elinor Fennick, her gold hair brown again, had found one of her farmhouse quilts gnawed by mice. She was cutting up an old shirt of Willson’s to patch it, when a gray shadow came into the room, and the smell of hot fruit, the odor of wasps and decay. Elinor stood up, stepped forward, floated the quilt over the table so that the folds draped to the floor, hiding Mariana.</p>
<p>With the sound of a stranger’s footstep on the floor, the back door quietly closed. Willson had been asleep, but he woke to danger as an animal would, and he always stepped out when men came for money, knowing that Elinor would save him. She clasped her hands behind her back, turning her rings so that the diamonds were hidden and only the platinum bands would show, plain as silver.</p>
<p>“I want what I’m owed,” the gray man said. “I’ve come to collect.”</p>
<p>He walked into the house, and Elinor’s blood drummed run, run, save yourself, through her heart, but there was the baby under the table, and so she stayed. “I don’t know you,” she said.</p>
<p>“I know you, Elinor Lake.”</p>
<p>He took her right hand, turned it palm up, pulled her fingers straight, and the handful of diamonds lay between them, glittering white. She tried to close her fingers, but the hand was not her own. It lay limp and open in his smooth palm.</p>
<p>“No,” she said. He let her take her hand back, and she rubbed life into her fingers. Her bangles clashed with the chime of real gold. She glanced at the sugar jar. He lifted the quilt off the table and looked at the wet-eyed baby, mouth stained orange with carrot juice. “No,” she said.</p>
<p>“I’ve come to collect what I’m owed.”</p>
<p>Elinor knelt to gather the baby into her arms. It was all she could do to pull Mariana close to her body. The baby gurgled and offered her a taste of carrot, and she shook her head. She looked down, away from the gray man’s face; she lowered her face into the baby’s sweet-smelling hair. She closed her eyes. “My husband’s outside,” she said.</p>
<p>The gray man turned on his heel and walked out the front door. From the back, there was a shout and a loud sound that made Mariana blink and purse her mouth angrily. Somebody, Elinor never knew who – somebody who had lent Willson money – had been waiting for him in the alley.</p>
<p>Two days later, she stood in her kitchen, Mariana in her arms again, while men searched her house. Not content with the sugar jar, they upended and emptied everything. They tore the cabinets off the walls and cut open her mattress. They found a hidden billfold with ninety dollars in it, a ruby ring that had belonged to Willson’s mother, and a string of glass pearl beads in a box from the best jeweler in San Antonio. They never touched Elinor’s cheap-looking stack of bangles, or the diamond rings that she had tied to a bunch of keys with red thread, or the baby’s blanket with almost two thousand dollars stitched into the purple feathers. It was Elinor Fennick who got on the westbound train to California and the sea, and Medora Hart who arrived, a fair young widow with a child in her arms and – as she was soon to realize – another on the way. That was her sweet James, who died in Korea.</p>
<p>The rings and bangles she’d bought with Willson’s money were long gone now. Her arthritis was so bad, she didn’t wear jewelry any more. She’d sold some of the things, that first year in California when it was so hard to find work. The rest she’d given away to her granddaughters and great-granddaughters over the years. She always gave a piece of fine jewelry when one of her girls graduated from college. She wished she had something to give Anne, for the little Medora someday.</p>
<p>As if she heard the thought, the baby began to cry the milk cry, and Medora’s heart prickled in memory. Anne sat with the baby in the chair in the corner and opened her blouse, right there in front of everybody, and Justin hunched his shoulder and carefully kept his face turned away from that side of the room.</p>
<p>The air felt like thunder. It was one of Medora’s dangerous days, and the white sleep flashed across her eyes again. When she woke up, somebody had changed the television over to golf, and Justin was playing with his Nintendo. He tried to explain the game, but she couldn’t even see the screen.</p>
<p>Twice she had seen the gray man face to face, but she learned the smell and feel of him, and she avoided him for years. The feel of thunder far off, the shivering heat of that summer day when she was Baby for the last time, the smell of rotting fruit.</p>
<p>Once she felt his presence at the beach, a summer day, baby Harold eating handfuls of sand under the beach umbrella, her second husband Jack – a lovely man, a dancer – letting the three older children bury him in the sand. She gathered the family up and took them home. Two people drowned that day, dragged out by the undertow. Once she smelled overripe peaches in a restaurant, and she made Jack take her somewhere else. The restaurant had an electrical fire that night, and three people were burned, though not badly. Once, years later, she stood in line at the American Airlines check-in counter to fly to New York, where her oldest grandchild was graduating from Stonybrook with a degree in, of all things, saxophone (bless his heart), when she looked up and saw the cashier’s head, a smooth leathery gray. She stepped out of line and walked away.</p>
<p>Absolutely nothing happened to the airplane. Maybe she had never saved herself at all. Maybe it was all a dream, a hundred and two years passing like a moment of that white sleep, in the clash of the swinging gate. Maybe it was all imagination, a rumor, a mistake.</p>
<p>“Where’s my cake,” she said, “I want cake.” The cooks at the facility were stingy with desserts. Two-inch cubes of cake, tiny bowls of pudding. Fruit salad, which she would not eat. The only time she ever had chocolate was when one of the young people brought her some, and sometimes she went weeks between visits.</p>
<p>“I want cake too,” Justin said.</p>
<p>Medora had been a strict mother – eat your vegetables and sit up straight – but she’d always had cake for the grandchildren, and candy for the great-grandchildren, because by then she’d given up baking, along with so much else. She’d outlived three of her children: James died in Korea, polio took Alice at six, and Ruth lay cold in her crib one morning, seventeen days old. Two of her grandchildren had died, one of cancer, another in a car crash. She’d raised James’s three children after his death. She’d helped her second husband, Jack, turn his dance studio into a real business. He died of lung cancer in 1964, but everybody smoked in those days. The children grew, the world changed, and happiness flickered behind her days like the tail of a kite.</p>
<p>Everybody started to sing Happy Birthday, a ragged chorus that converged by the second line. Under the choir of dear Granny she heard a single voice, low but strong, singing dear Medora. The gray man pushed a silver trolley into the room, with one hundred and six candles blazing, and the icing was as blue as the sky.</p>
<p>Medora said, “No.”</p>
<p>“Granny, are you okay?” Justin asked. Everybody else had gathered around the cake to blow out the candles for her, and he was the only one who heard. He took her hand, gently, careful of her arthritis. Such a sweet boy. He reminded her of dear James.</p>
<p>The gray man smiled at her as he sliced the cake. The knife slid through the blue icing, and the smell poured out, brown and rotten and sweet. He gave the first piece to Anne, a corner piece thick with icing, and Anne passed it to Medora. “I don’t want cake,” Medora said.</p>
<p>Anne passed the plate to Justin. He accepted it unwillingly, and held it out to Medora. “But it’s your birthday, Granny, it’s your cake.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want it.”</p>
<p>One of the granddaughters – Anne’s mother, Raquel – took over the cake-cutting, and the gray man brought a glass of lemonade to Medora. She stuck out her lower lip, a child’s face but she couldn’t stop herself, and said, “I don’t want it. Go away.” The lemonade smelled, but not as badly as the cake. She wouldn’t take anything from him. Her right hand was never the same after he touched it, the day Willson died. Her grip was never as strong again, and her arthritis began in those fingers years before it touched any other joint.</p>
<p>“You might as well eat that, young man,” the gray man said to Justin.</p>
<p>Justin stuck the plastic fork in the cake, but he gave Medora another doubtful look. “Are you really sure, Granny?”</p>
<p>“Medora, Medora!” the gray man said. “Eat your cake.”</p>
<p>The sun was warm on Medora’s hair. Yesterday a nurse had come to give her a sponge bath, so she would be clean and fresh for her birthday party, and had washed her hair with the shampoo she liked, the kind that smelled of medicine and not of flowers. The young people laughed and talked among themselves; cousins who hadn’t seen each other for years had found one another in this room. “Aren’t you having a happy birthday?” Justin asked.</p>
<p>“I am, I am happy. Give me my cake.”</p>
<p>The gray man was gone. The smell came off the cake and it was horrible. Medora put her finger in the icing and licked it, cautiously, making a suspicious face. But it tasted sweet and clean, pure sugar. A hundred years passed like a bird’s shadow, a swinging gate, and she closed her eyes to taste it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dr. McCoy’s examining rooms have been musty since the forties, when he opened his little office on the Mt. Hebron square. Not long after Daddy died, which was just last month, I showed up in one of them. I ticked off a list of symptoms, just as soon as he opened the door.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen this coming for years,” he said, sitting across from me on his stool, “and, I’m not a damn bit surprised.”</p>
<p>He took one last pull on his cigarette and dabbed the butt in his ashtray, a ceramic replica of a healthy, pink lung. Smoke came out of his nostrils, and he sighed, like the burden was all his; then, he rubbed his bloodshot eyes. “Come on now,” he said, like a coach. “Get real. Evelyn,” he said. “You know what you need?”</p>
<p>“Tell me,” I said.</p>
<p>“You know what a fiddle is?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“It’s a sensitive instrument, am I right? When it gets coiled too tight, it can’t sing.” He opened a metal drawer and pulled out a pad. “Am I right now?” he said. “Try this, you hear,” he said and scribbled something I knew the pharmacist would call, as always, “McCoy’s dang chicken scratch.”</p>
<p>“If that don’t work,” he said, “and it probably won’t. Go for a ride.” He leaned back. Behind him the wallpaper was stained nicotine. “Get out on a Sunday afternoon. Take you a long, long ride, you hear?”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Bert, my husband, was in the waiting room. “That didn’t take long,” he said, when he saw me. “He even look at you good?”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah,” I said. “He looked.”</p>
<p>But the truth is, Dr. McCoy hadn’t. He didn’t check my heart. He didn’t feel my glands. He didn’t see my tonsils. He asked me about my yard. “You got any tomatoes growing?” he’d asked. “Not this summer,” I said. “Huh,” he said. “You must feel real lousy not to grow a tomato.” He said, “Go for that ride now.”</p>
<p>It was one of those hot, hot days. The parking lot had asphalt that played tricks on the mind. I thought I saw water, and I felt thirsty, like a castaway.</p>
<p>Bert opened his truck door, and I climbed through an oven of heat. I was wearing shorts, and the vinyl stuck to my skin. “Where to now?” he asked.</p>
<p>“The pharmacy,” I said, and then, though I was trying to break the habit, I started in on my nails.</p>
<p>“Gnaw them to a pulp,” Bert said, like a challenge, as he found a parking space right in front of Clyde’s pharmacy. We could see Clyde, counting pills, and we could see his short wife, too, Beverly Anne, her sweeping, sweeping, sweeping around a tall metal stand holding crutches and canes. I stared over at Bert’s nails: clean, trim. Then, I glanced back up at Beverly Anne, who’d stopped sweeping to see if we were ever going to get out. Bert will outlive me, I thought, if I let this shit go on.</p>
<p>“How about ride me around a little longer,” I said.</p>
<p>“What?” he asked.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Somehow, years ago, I birthed Bert’s girl. We’d gone without sex for a solid year straight; then, we did it, quick, once, on the fourteenth day, and three weeks later, my breasts were so sore I couldn’t sleep. “Damn,” I said. “Miraculous,” I said.</p>
<p>Her name is Leigh, named after my big sister, Becky Leigh, who’s been dead and gone a long time now. Leigh does her living in the City of Roses, Portland, Oregon: three thousand miles away from me.</p>
<p>She teaches at a Montessori school off Burnside where the children eat kalamata olives. They don’t call Leigh their teacher. They call her their guide. When the little boys cry, I imagine Leigh, easing down to their level. “I can see you&#8217;re angry,” I hear her say, guiding. “How about you just tell the world why?”</p>
<p>You’d never know she grew up around here, a fact I’m certain she’s mighty proud of.</p>
<p>I’ve lost her. One time, when she wasn’t but eleven years old, she tried to guide me direct. I was in the kitchen, and she tapped my shoulder. “Mama,” she said, “I ran back in class to get my jacket, and I heard Mrs. Thompson say something to Mrs. Parker, out in the hall.”</p>
<p>“What’s that, hon?” I asked.</p>
<p>“She said there’s something real fishy about you and Daddy.” Leigh cocked her head towards the living room. Bert had his back turned to us. The television was loud. It was the fall, and Georgia was whipping Florida. “He’s deaf,” Leigh said, “so what you reckon Mrs. Thompson meant?”</p>
<p>Now, I don’t get to have Leigh but on the phone.</p>
<p>And she’s not my best friend, not like I dreamed about when she was growing inside of me. Between us, there’s lots unsaid.</p>
<p>But, when she grew not far below my heart, I wrote her immense love letters that when she got old enough to partly understand, I never let her see, much less read. I ought to burn them, but instead, I’ve been sneaking them out. I swallow two a day; it’s like nibbling cookies on a diet. I savor each line slow.</p>
<p>I used to address God, down on my knees, but now I’ve been standing, hoping that, if I’m a little higher to the sky, I’ll be a little faster to be heard.</p>
<p>Sometimes I skip God and go straight to Mrs. George Tyson. She’s dead. But she got a divorce, the only divorce in Hebron, the year my big sister died. People thought she didn’t belong in church no more, because of it, but she showed up, early, wearing straight dust and denim. Every Sunday of my childhood, she showed up.</p>
<p>Last Sunday, when the choir director waved his hands, indicating it was time to sit down, I kept standing. I glanced back at her empty pew. Bert tugged on my skirt. “Evelyn,” he said. “Sit.”</p>
<p>“Dear Mrs. George Tyson,” I said, in my head, instead of “Dear God.” I said, “Give me, damn it, the gumption I need.”</p>
<p>Then, I sat down.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Sometimes I try to lure Leigh back with promises of home-cooking. “We’ve got things they can’t imagine,” I say.</p>
<p>“Oh, Mother,” she says, “If you just knew a thing. The food out here, you wouldn’t believe!”</p>
<p>Bert’s got red signs that line a freeway, The Fall Line Freeway, runs right up against our town, big red signs, “Eat at Bert’s BBQ,” those big signs everywhere, so, I said, “They don’t have your daddy’s barbecue.”</p>
<p>“Mother,” she said, again, which ticks me off, every time, every single time. “What this ‘Mother’ business?” I asked. “Since when did you abandon ‘Mama’?”</p>
<p>Silence on the other end, just miles of it, her out there, so foreign, independent, and well-fed. All these years, what rumors has she lived with?</p>
<p>“Mother,” I said, “it just sounds so distant, so, I don’t know, unfriendly.”</p>
<p>“I’d say we’re friendly,” she said, like she’d describe her relationship with the neighbor six doors down, and we hung up like that.</p>
<p>After I slipped the phone back in its cradle, I sat on the edge of my bed, my ankles crossed. Hebron’s got a phone book. I don’t know why. It’s skinny, not metro, and just about every number I need, I can recite by heart. Still, I scanned the T’s.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Hello,” Gerald, Mrs. George Tyson’s cousin, the inheritor of her blessed old truck, said, after I dialed his number.</p>
<p>“Gerald,” I said, “This is Evelyn down the road.” I said, “What was your mama’s real name?” I said, “Because it wasn’t Mrs. George Tyson.” I said, “You know, her first name.” I said, “The name she went by as a girl.”</p>
<p>I pictured his shed. Behind most old houses in the South is a shed that holds the decaying vehicles of the beloved: dead Aunt Raytha’s jalopy, for instance, or Grandpa’s Caddy.</p>
<p>These cars, these trucks, they die a slow death; the tires become flat, the roof gets rusty; still, the car, the dead relative, they become one. You don’t dare get rid of it. One glance at it, and down flies their spirit.</p>
<p>On the line, I could hear lots of commotion. Gerald roused up. “Give me my glasses,” he said to his ornery wife.</p>
<p>“Good Lord,” his ornery wife said, “Gerald,” she said, “Has somebody died?”</p>
<p>Gerald said, “Evelyn, you know what time it is?”</p>
<p>I reached for my own glasses. I glanced over at the clock on the far-off dresser. “Good Lord,” I said.</p>
<p>“Damn near midnight,” he said. “You having trouble?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Give me that,” his wife said. “Evelyn,” she said. “What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“I’m on Western time,” I said.</p>
<p>She said, “You’re not making a dab of sense.”</p>
<p>I’ve never hung up on anybody I can remember, and I didn’t bang the phone down then. It was tender. I let the receiver slide, gently, down from my ear, across my chest, then, a slight click.</p>
<p>They say marriage is good for a man. After Mrs. George Tyson got rid of George, George slid downhill. His belly went swollen, and his head went white, and by the end of the second season, he was dead.</p>
<p>Mrs. George Tyson, she learned to drive, and she bought the Ford; it was blue, like a clear, summer sky. Behind the wheel, she wore her hat, a yellow straw hat with a lean, leaping green deer sewn in a white patch above her brain.</p>
<p>After I hung up on Gerald’s wife, I got reckless. They didn’t tell me Mrs. George Tyson’s first name, so I stuck my shoes on and went walking.</p>
<p>I walked in the shadows of the pines along 15 until I ran up behind Gerald’s house. Across his yard, a big fat moon was my hindrance, but I stayed out of the light, and when I saw the dog pen, empty, I remembered Buster, how they’d just had to have him put down, and this felt, somehow, on my behalf. Encouraged, I tip-toed.</p>
<p>In the South, there is death all around. Everybody’s got somebody destroyed in war. Around the dog pen, I saw the tailgate of Mrs. George Tyson’s truck sticking out back of the shed, and beyond that, in the field, was the old Tyson cemetery, it behind a fence, not a black iron fence like that say is down in Savannah, but an old wire fence, like the kind to pen in animals, and there were markers, little squares, with names and dates etched out with a stick, looking just like Doctor McCoy’s chicken scratch, hard to make out. I saw WWI scribbled and WWII.</p>
<p>But Mrs. George Tyson’s resting place was more recent, and though she’d survived many a war with Mr. George, her marker didn’t honor that.</p>
<p>Despite this lack, I could make her name out clear. “Mary Sanders Tyson.” I did the math. “Dang,” I said, “She lived a hundred and two years.” I shot an eye over at George’s marker. He didn’t fair so well.</p>
<p>“Dear Mary,” I said, the next time I found myself in church. “I carry a lot of shame over never learning to drive.” I said, “I can get it out on the grass, but it scares me on the highway.”</p>
<p>This talking went on into the night, and when the sky began to lighten, I knew I’d have to pick this conversation up at home.</p>
<p>The long walk back, down 15, I said, “Oh Mary, at night, it’s just me and the owls.” I said, “I get so despondent.” I said, “Can’t you see? It’s gotten so bad.” I said, “I wish I was brave.” I said, “Dear Mary, find me a blue Ford, will you?”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>My big sister’s name was Becky Leigh, and she tried to get a divorce, too, when they weren’t common. Mama had her when she was young, and she had me when she was old, and Becky Leigh rarely came home, not until she left her husband, and I didn’t know her, see, though I knew her name.</p>
<p>That summer, I was twelve, when my big sister returned from Atlanta. I was living in her old room, sleeping in her old bed. She stood in the hallway, and we stared, like strangers. A rat terrier ravaged with the mange was tucked tight under one armpit, while a knotty suitcase was clutched beneath the other. For a long time there, everything on or near Becky Leigh looked neglected or mad one.</p>
<p>Right at first, she wouldn’t let on how bad it went wrong, so Mama, I remember, had to keep faithful in melting the sharp edges down. After supper, for nights in a row, Mama filled the tub with warm water and drops of rose. “Come,” she said, “You need another dunk.”</p>
<p>Out on the porch, we all sat, sweating, the three of us in the swing, me, Mama, Daddy, and the dog hassling beneath. We kept quiet, while inside, Becky Leigh thrashed the water about and cried, a sort of shattered-soul cry, like that, maybe, of a mad, wet cat.</p>
<p>“You just watch,” Daddy said, overly optimistic, nights into the mess. “She’ll get her strut back.”</p>
<p>Mama was sitting on my right, Daddy on the left. Daddy was swinging us high, but when he said that, I heard Mama’s skid marks, as she shoved her heels, hard, into the wooden floorboards and dragged us to a halt. Every night, Mama’d been tightening with an inner belt of anger, and though Daddy commented on the lightning bugs, twinkling out there, oh, the sweet smell of a summer night, Mama wasn’t having it.</p>
<p>“Well, Goddamn it, when she does,” Mama said, reaching in front of my face and grabbing Daddy by the collar, “I’m not letting her go off with just anybody, not like you did.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After a while, things quieted down. Becky Leigh hadn’t noticed me much, not until a few weeks before my thirteenth birthday, and when she did, I felt cornered, intimidated by her long stares. I was washing the dishes, when she walked right up to me, silent, and untied my flowery apron. She turned off the hot water. “You come on outside,” she said. “I got something you need to know how to do.”</p>
<p>With beige heels on and her strength returning, my big sister flounced, and I followed the breeze in her swish. At least a half foot taller than me, she wore a peach-colored dress that swung wide, and when we got in the shade of the old oak, she lifted my chin towards the sunlight twinkling through an ancient limb. She bent forward, so that our eyes were level, hers dead-serious, gunmetal gray-blue, like the car she’d named Clara Barton, a Civil War nurse, founder of the American Red Cross.</p>
<p>“Get into Clara,” she said, and opened the driver’s side door of her Fairlane, a car rusted but capable of running. I stood there, biting my lip. Off in the distance, her terrier had treed a squirrel and that’s how I felt, treed, with those eyes on me.</p>
<p>“Get in,” she said.</p>
<p>I said, ‘Maybe later.”</p>
<p>She whipped me towards her; “How about maybe now?”</p>
<p>Her nails were painted pearl, but each one left a raw half-moon mark in the softest and palest part of my upper arm. I couldn’t look her in the eyes, but in her mouth stood a chipped tooth I once remembered whole.</p>
<p>It took me till the sun climbed down, but she stayed patient with me and the clutch. Daddy, Mama, they weren’t home, so it was just this Clara Barton somebody, my big sister, and me, my big sister with her long pretty fingers, a cigarette burning between them, her elbow draped over the passenger windowsill, the three of us burning a pig-path through dry grass, around the house, the Butler Bin, the red barn.</p>
<p>She stayed quiet. I stayed quiet. I think we both feared the car stopping. I moved us around and around the yard, until, finally, she said, “That’s good for now.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Becky Leigh’s divorce didn’t go through. Harold Harrison, a lawyer and also her husband, called up one night, and said, “I wouldn’t want to shock your system, but you’re still mine.”</p>
<p>When late summer turned early fall and the husband wouldn’t stop calling, all hours of the night, and our Barney Fife proved to be no help, Mama got her carving knife out, until Daddy, softer, steered that option away.</p>
<p>“Now, now,” he said, one evening when the husband’s threats got violent. “Let’s keep our heads.” He said, “I’ve got a sound plan.”</p>
<p>We listened. None of us turned away when Becky Leigh opened her knotty suitcase and emptied her childhood chest of drawers. Out poured her silky panties, lacy bras. “Hurry,” we said, huddled there, in the bedroom, a room me and her now shared, all of us standing in the center of the rug, including the rat terrier, him anxious too, since he’d just gotten his shiny coat back.</p>
<p>The window unit, I remember, was as loud as a big truck shifting down, and we startled each time it jammed out of rhythm. “You drive straight there,” Mama said, “and you call us.”</p>
<p>“What’s the way again?” Daddy asked Becky Leigh.</p>
<p>“I could just stab him,” Mama said, and because we believed her, Daddy said, “Two rights, right?”</p>
<p>“Two rights and a left,” Becky Leigh said. “And then,” she said, “It’s about thirty miles to Milledgeville.”</p>
<p>“Go,” he said. “Your Aunt Susie’s waiting.” Then, he said, as though to remind himself, “He won’t know where that’s at.”</p>
<p>But Becky Leigh told him. And until Daddy died, he blamed Aunt Susie for it. Aunt Susie was rail-thin, never married, but sweet, so sweet she dressed in pale purple and smelled of lilac. But she was sad, and Daddy didn’t realize it. Her house echoed, like an empty church, and no matter how young or old the girl was, she always asked, “How many boyfriends you got?”</p>
<p>Aunt Susie kept her Bible in an infant-yellow knitted covering, so it wouldn’t get “banged up,” and when she wasn’t reading the stories within, she was watching the story, <em>The Young &amp; the Restless</em>, and sometimes, it seems now, the two worlds clearly blurred, because, she got it in her head that Becky Leigh was like Peter and her marriage was like the storm on the shore of Galilee, so when Becky Leigh described for her how the white winds howled and the white waves went high, Aunt Susie told her, “Honey, you’ve just got to stay in the boat.”</p>
<p>“And,” Aunt Susie said, “keep right on rowing.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>For a while, my big sister was doing all right. She’d enrolled in the little college, Georgia College for Women, what today is called Georgia College &amp; State University, and from Aunt Susie’s house, she could walk to typing and French. Sometimes she’d call, and Mama would answer, and while we’d stand around the phone in the kitchen, listening to Becky Leigh say things like, “And the professor, she brought this thing called <em>quiche</em>,” we’d scan the forsythia bushes along Mama’s fence, scared silly we might find, any minute, Harold’s eyeballs bulging out.</p>
<p>Aunt Susie was a good cook, and Daddy loved this about his sister, how she, unlike Mama, could get the lacy edges on her cornbread right. Most Sundays, she invited us to Milledgeville for chicken dumplings and tarts, the fruit hanging from the bushes and the trees at the back of her yard. It was after such a spread, not long after Becky Leigh died, that Aunt Susie let it slip.</p>
<p>“I’m going to tell you now,” she said. “I don’t believe I’ve seen a sadder stray.” She coughed. “I was right over there,” she said, “next to the stove when I saw that man peeking through my peach limb, and let me tell you, he had the biggest old eyes you’ve ever seen, just deep blue wells of sorrow and pain.”</p>
<p>Daddy’s fork was suspended in mid-air, but Aunt Susie wouldn’t have known it, since her eyes were fixated on her plate. She said, “Becky Leigh was back in the sewing room. I don’t know why. She didn’t have any interest in sewing. I hollered back there, and I told her, I said, “I believe you might ought to come see if you recognize this man.”</p>
<p>Aunt Susie kept her face down. With a cloth napkin, she took a long time to dab at the corners of her mouth. “Well,” she said, “let me get up and see about our tarts.”</p>
<p>But Daddy released his fork. It dropped in a loud crash. He reached over to steady Aunt Susie’s hand. “Suzanne,” he said. “Nobody gives a damn about the tarts.”</p>
<p>I’ve never been afraid of my daddy, not one time; Mama, she’s a different story, but Daddy was a lamb, but if he got lion in him, it was time to run. Becky Leigh hadn’t been buried six months, and it was the first time we’d gone over to Aunt Susie’s since what the local papers had called a tragic accident.</p>
<p>Daddy leaped. He overpowered the table, when he grabbed the back of the empty dining room chair, Becky Leigh’s old mahogany seat, and threw it across the room towards his sister’s china hutch, legs first.</p>
<p>“Well, Henry,” Aunt Susie said, shaking, all of her body shaking, her feeble hands, her feeble head. “I didn’t announce my address!” She bowed her head. “He was her husband, Henry. After all, I guess he had a right to see her.”</p>
<p>She eased up out of her chair; honestly, I don’t know what she was thinking. She walked closer to Daddy, one step too far. Her old fingers trembled. She whispered, “Weren’t we raised not to give up after a little old spat?”</p>
<p>This man, my daddy, it was clear he wasn’t capable of being reached. His head went down, closer to Aunt Susie’s face, his nose titled towards the floor, like a herding dog on heels. He head-butted the air, all the way till he got Aunt Susie hemmed into the corner of the kitchen, right by the stove, in front of the window where she first laid eyes on the man.</p>
<p>Aunt Susie tried to cross her arms over her head. Her shoulders were stiff, unable to rise, but she covered her face in defense, and when she slid down the wallpaper dotted with old grease and faded tulips, she made a low whimpering noise. I saw her thighs, when her thin dress rose above her knee, her thighs, translucent, without muscle or tone, my Aunt Susie, exposed, with her thighs covered in a congested blue highway of broken veins.</p>
<p>Daddy returned to himself. He stepped back. He said, “Oh God, oh why, oh how?” Quickly, he bent forward, and Aunt Susie gripped her brother’s forearm and was lifted, as from burning wreckage, towards his chest. They held each other tight, their faces buried so we couldn’t see, and the sobs came fast, and Aunt Susie said, “Henry, oh Henry, he carried her in his car. They weren’t going but down to the corner for a quick bite of supper.” And, because Becky Leigh and her husband both died, she said, “I don’t know. We’ll never know.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After that visit, Mama went straight to bed. She kept a carving knife by her lamp, even though she knew it was too late for Becky Leigh then. At Mama’s funeral, which happened not long after, the preacher said, “Anger will win. It’ll straight kill you.”</p>
<p>When I hit eighteen, five years after Mama died, Daddy said, “I’m Hawk-Eye now.” He said, protective, “I’m going to stay on you like white on rice.”</p>
<p>On my thirtieth birthday, finally engaged, Hawk-Eye got me a surprise, a double-wide trailer, brand-new, wall to wall blue carpet, with kitchen cabinets that smelled of waxed, fake wood. I’ll never forget the two big trucks that hauled my halved home, split straight down the middle, all the way down 15. Daddy waved at the two big drivers. He instructed them to plant my home in his back yard, not more than fifty yards from his door, out by the shed, which had become a casket for the car, Clara Barton.</p>
<p>When the men left, he said, “I feel better now.” He said, “You need to show Bert sometime.”</p>
<p>Bert and me, we did our best to make it ours. I staked a fence around the tires, which seems meaningful now, and in front of the fence, Bert planted tall, thick shrubs. By the time we were grounded, the wheels had disappeared.</p>
<p>The following week, I got married; Daddy hung satin from the rafters in his barn and formed an aisle of sprinkled hay. He paid for three nights at an old hotel on the Mt. Hebron square, and he called, on the hour, every hour, until we decided to just honeymoon the last two in his swing.</p>
<p>Every fall, at the Kaolin Parade, for years, our small graduating class has ridden on the back of a pick-up. Before we were married, Bert and me, we sat on opposite bales of hay, him down at the tailgate, me up near the cab. I never looked at him. He never looked at me.</p>
<p>But, one fall, when we were about to hit twenty-nine, the only other classmate who’d waited nearly as long to meet somebody was Sandra Mathis, blind in both eyes, and on that sunny October day, she stuck her hand out and said, “See.”</p>
<p>The ring sparkled, and that’s when Tommy Sampson, the old quarterback, shouted up at me and down at Bert. “Hey!” Tommy said, “Isn’t it about time you sniffed each other out?”</p>
<p>I felt pellets of candy hit my chest. Nancy Cramer had bad aim. “I was trying,” she said, “for those children in the crowd.” My eyes welled up from the sting.</p>
<p>Another block down, I was about to lose it, as Tommy Sampson egged him on. “Hey, Bert,” he said. “I see some space up there next to her. Why don’t you go try?”</p>
<p>Everybody laughed. And I did too. But I was biting a hole out of the inside of my bottom lip, willing myself not to sob, especially when Tommy Sampson said, “You got to get by Evelyn’s old man though. He’s going to keep her tied to a post.”</p>
<p>At sunset, the next Saturday, Bert showed up in Daddy’s driveway. He was carrying a blue corsage, awkward as prom, and though I think he wanted our encounter to start out with an expression of goodwill, he cut right to the bone.</p>
<p>“Listen, Mr. Henry,” he said, “I’ve got something important to take care of with your daughter.” Daddy had showed him a chair on the porch. When I got outside, Bert sat up straight, very noble. He said, after Daddy went inside for a drink of water, “We get talked about.” He said, “I’ve been up all night, sick of it. Aren’t you?”</p>
<p>On our wedding day, when I turned to face the guests- all our married classmates- when we ran pummeled under a spray of their rice, I sensed Bert and me were failing ourselves, but now, in a final way, before the town and God, we’d have no choice but to go right on, living blind.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>About a year ago, when Daddy first got bad sick, Sandra Mathis and her husband bought ten acres a mile or so down the highway. She was good to come over. She brought tea cookies, warm from the oven, big pitchers of cold lemonade. Daddy said, “Sandra, being blind’s never held you back,” and she said, “Amen to that.”</p>
<p>During that time, she started sniffing around. “Where’s Bert?” she might ask. “Is he off gallivanting?”</p>
<p>“At work,” I’d say. “Running a restaurant takes morning, noon, and night.”</p>
<p>Her husband had just retired from the kaolin plant, and they’d been venturing across the county line. As Daddy grew weaker by the hour, Sandra grew stronger with what she had to say. “When he’s dead,” she said, “you can get out of the county and see you a little bit too.”</p>
<p>“Tennessee,” she said, not missing a beat. “Oh the pancakes we had, big and round as an old steering wheel. I’ve never seen so many pancakes.” She went on, describing the cool, clear air of The Great Smoky Mountains. “We saw bears,” she said. “But they were caged.” She said, “People threw stale bread at them, but not me.” She said, “That’s just encouraging the attraction.” She said, “Them bears got caged, but they ought not have, you know.”</p>
<p>Last night, her husband dropped her off. Bert was gone. And, of course, Daddy was too. It was just me, in the trailer, in the woods. She said, “We discovered Atlanta.” I knew they’d been planning a trip to the Georgia Aquarium. I thought I was about to learn about hammerhead sharks. “Bad traffic,” she said. “We got caught up in a parade.” She leaned close. “We need to talk about that parade.”</p>
<p>I’d been afraid to stare at her eyes, but I did then, an intense cataract-gray. “We wound up at Einstein’s in Midtown. They got good banana pancakes.” She rubbed my hand. “Bert and that man, Aaron Reynolds, were there.”</p>
<p>She said, “On gay pride day.”</p>
<p>My gut coiled. “Ya’ll must not have seen right,” I said.</p>
<p>She said, “Plain as day.”</p>
<p>“Aaron’s dating that woman, isn’t he, what’s her name?” I said, “She’s from out town.” I said, “What’s her name? He’s been dating her a long time.”</p>
<p>I thought of Aaron, in the kaolin parade, riding on a bale of hay, him in the pick-up behind ours, him one class year younger, him, the only one from that group never to have married.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When Sandra’s husband picked her up, I stayed in the yard. From where I stood, I could see Daddy’s house. I hadn’t been inside since the day he died. The key he kept to the house was underneath the clay pot. When I opened the door, the dark house was hot, and the heat made the smell of him strong. When I sat in his recliner, I could feel his presence baked in the thread. From there, I saw a ghost slip down the hall. A dress swished, and a young girl stood, in a fury of light.</p>
<p>She yanked my arm. “Get up,” she said.</p>
<p>In her old bedroom, in my old bedroom, she had me find a box. Inside, I discovered Harold Harrison’s promises to love her better. But that’s not all. I found notes addressed to self. “Becky Leigh’s Goals,” one said, a note where she’d figured the math on the car, how she’d earn it, how long it’d take, and the number of miles she could get out of an oil change.</p>
<p>She had records of reasons to run. “Bruised,” one said, “Again, tonight, for cheating.” From our window, I could see Clara Barton’s back lights, her tailpipe. “But I’m not cheating,” she wrote, followed by a road of exclamation points.</p>
<p>I read each, sitting on the rug; then, I crawled to our bed, and I curled up, beneath our quilt. I rocked, with the tears, and I held my stomach, and I thought of Leigh, how good it felt when she was a part of me. I was an angry mother.</p>
<p>Is that why she ran away?</p>
<p>I need to feel her hand on my shoulder. I need to hear her say, “Mama, I can see you’re angrier than shit. Why don’t you just breathe and tell us why?”</p>
<p>“I’m angry,” I shouted. “I’m so goddamn angry.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Now, morning has come; the sun is sharp, and I’m sweating in my old childhood bed. There’s no air on in Daddy’s house, so I get up, and I go across the hall to the bathroom. I splash water in my face. Out the window, I can see my trailer. Bert’s truck, it’s still gone.</p>
<p>I go back to the bedroom. In a little glass container is Becky Leigh’s pearl earrings. By them sits her keys. When I step out, into the yard, the sky is cloudless, brilliant blue, hot as chrome. I walk towards the shade in the shed. The tires are flat, locked in by fire-ant beds. I tear at vines that threaten to strangle her door.</p>
<p>When I climb in, it’s to a nest of wasps. Rats, I sense, are chewing wires around Clara Barton’s engine. But I don’t jump. I close my eyes, and I picture Mary Sanders Tyson, her living old, lively, in her yellow straw hat. “Mary,” I ask, “What’s it going to feel like, to drive away from the poor house?” I do the math. I can sell Daddy’s land; I can sell his house. I play at switching gears. Ahead is the wooden back wall of this shed, but I see my daughter, her Oregon, all the miles more.</p>
