					<description><![CDATA[This piece by Leslie Tucker left me with a twinge of nostalgia and misty eyes.  She won&#039;t be reading my comment, but thank you for your service, Leslie, and for your story.  I can say, I felt it by your words.  I, too, am looking at 60 and there&#039;s much water under the bridge in my life, too.  Do the tango as often as necessary, wash off the balaclava and keep writing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This flash fiction piece interestingly brings the United States&#039; involvement in the war in Iraq closer to home.  The people of the United States have been criticized for their distance from the war and the realities that have transpired thereof.  For those fortunate enough not to have sent or lost a loved one abroad, elements of this war, like no wartime taxes, have initiated this argument.  However, this personal, journalistic, piece that contains the realities and tragedies of both war and &quot;normal&quot; American life, remind us of those familiar individuals that are indeed fighting for our country today.]]></description>
