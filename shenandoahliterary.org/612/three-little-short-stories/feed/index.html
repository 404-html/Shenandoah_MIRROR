					<description><![CDATA[Dysfunctional love stories tend to veer into either pessimism or a sickly-bittersweet sentimentality, yet these three pieces somehow manage to avoid all the pitfalls and offer three emotionally-real insights into the ways love can go wrong.  I was particularly struck by the language of passivity that recurred in all three stories.  I loved that the first narrator describes her meeting her future husband as their &quot;enter[ing] each other&#039;s orbits&quot;; the language here is both portentous and foreshadows the pair&#039;s inability to healthily disengage from each other.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Stubborn fears: it never occurred to me to think of them this way, but of course it&#039;s exactly right. There are so many moments like this, little flashes of insight or turns of phrase, that made connections with me. It must have something to do with how very honest and plainspoken these three little love stories are. Every line carries its own weight and then something more beyond that. Nothing is in excess. Nothing is a throwaway. No matter who you are, you can come away from this story having learned something.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed a few small moments the most - ones that felt brutal, especially for love stories, but true. For example, the phrase &quot;we gave up and got married&quot; in the first story particularly struck me. That signals the end of the love in their relationship, as both start cheating on each other soon after. The pair had ceded to the man&#039;s grandmother&#039;s wishes in getting married. They don&#039;t just give up on their belief that they don&#039;t need marriage; they give up on their love as well. In all three of her stories the author doesn&#039;t romanticize love, and that makes them feel refreshing and real.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed the dimensions of this story; showing this woman at different stages of her life and with different experiences under her belt. I loved taking in the wisdom that she gained from her experiences and her reflections on them as she grows up. I loved seeing her relationships with men and how they developed as she learned from them over the years and how they influenced her later relationships. 
I also loved her ability to retain relevance to the time in which she was referring, mentioning Joplin in the first section. The subtitles were witty. And, I loved the symbol of the locket.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Pam Durban exposes the darker side of love in this story. Each section captivated me, and I wanted to keep reading and know more about the women and their relationships. The separation of stories gave the piece momentum and kept the reader yearning for more.  The love stories are relatable and illuminate the ugly, messy elements of relationships. Durban&#039;s writing is exceptional--her vivid descriptions and expression of human emotion bring the story to life in the mind of the reader.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks to everyone who read and responded to my little love stories.  There&#039;s nothing more heartening for a writer to hear than that people &quot;got&quot; what she was trying to do. I&#039;m grateful to you all.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am inadvertently responsible for the bone, in that the soup was a Christmas present. Seeing what good literary purpose it served, I feel I should offer tiny chicken bones to all those who find love late in life. Every love story has its bone, but if you chew it, the marrow will make you strong. Pam Durban is a gorgeous writer -- a supple, delicate thinker. More love stories, please.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Achieving resonance with a story entitled &quot;Three Little Love Stories&quot; is a tremendously difficult task, yet Durban artlessly does so. I felt that her voice pushed forth the impact of this piece; it became personal, intimate, and raw. With each vignette, Durban conveys an evolution in experience and maturity that furthers the protagonist to an elevated understanding of love. In &quot;Riddle Me This,&quot; love&#039;s passion is soiled with seeds of selfishness that sprout vengeance. This love is thus short-lived; the protagonist was not accepted for her true self, and was forced to uphold a marriage she did not fully believe in. In &quot;All Hallow&#039;s Eve,&quot; lust is confused for love, and love is considered an avenue of escape from weighty emotional baggage. The protagonist and her lover share this core motive for seeking each other out, and thus attain an uneasy understanding that is better than the previous story&#039;s love.
Lastly, in &quot;Little Bone,&quot; the protagonist reflects upon her long chain of experiences that have led her to cloud her view of life with pessimism. She fears a little bone because of all the negative potential it has, thus demonstrating the occupation of her mind with the consideration of fatalistic possibility. She finds comfort with her lover, who understands the way she is, and thus attempts to ease her. And, ultimately, through a mutual comprehension of one another, they are able to accept themselves and each other, and thus achieve a lasting, mature love.
Durban intimately communicates the values of the many degrees of love, and allows us to understand that the strongest love is based upon acceptance and understanding--dealing with issues rather than escaping from them, or ignoring them in favor of vengeance.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was also drawn to this story because of the title. But these stories could not have been farther away from the typical love story. I thought these stories were interesting because they were real. They all rang true with the times that we are in. The divorce rate in America is 50%, so falling in love is more of a risk than ever. I think that these stories perfectly capture that hesitancy to risk love again following a bad experience and shows the value love retains even after a fall.]]></description>
