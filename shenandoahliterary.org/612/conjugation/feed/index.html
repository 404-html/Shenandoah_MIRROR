					<description><![CDATA[This is an excellent piece of flash fiction as far as content.  It grabbed me in the first line and held me until the end.  

The descriptions in this piece tell the story more than anything.  They were vivid without appearing that the author tried too hard to set the scene.  He also used as few words as possible in the exchange between the two characters while still managing to convey the nature of their relationship.  This is so important in flash and not so easy to do.  

While it didn&#039;t end in a big surprise or twist, the ending was perfect for the story....love at its best and saddest.

					<description><![CDATA[I’ve been mulling over why this story is so affecting.  Really amazing how much the author has managed to convey in so few words.  It&#039;s a terrific piece of writing.  The story grabs from the very first sentence.  I’d never really thought about how isolating, strained and awkward a conjugal visit might be and here, in this beautifully understated story, the sights, sounds, and smells of loveless confinement are made vividly real.  I find myself drawn to Ray, the prisoner who is aching to be loved and to Kelly, the loyal wife who has driven 200 miles to bed down with a stranger.  I feel the compression of time, the reality of the clock radio keeping score, the certainty that every word counts.   Ordinary details of their marriage are artfully shared and along with it the certainty that this couple will endure.  “She laid her hand across his chest and felt his ribs.  Here lay the old Ray, tender and foolish, and easily broken.” I know them and I’m rooting for them.  Bravo to this writer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[LOL to the previous post!  I think his latter suggestion of &quot;he can really write&quot; is the more appropriate.  I&#039;ve read his other material &#038; can honestly say &quot;He can really write!&quot;]]></description>
