					<description><![CDATA[This is a beautiful story. I don&#039;t believe that we are supposed to read the narrator as a man at all. It seems pretty clear that the speaker is Aeneas&#039;s dead wife Creusa. After all, the story is a letter and it&#039;s signed &quot;love, Creusa&quot; so Creusa is speaking to Dido, the Queen of Carthage; Aeneas&#039;s former love interest is cautioning his current love interest, all of which just makes the story more beautiful.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The sense of betrayal permeates this piece. The story of Creusa and Aeneas gives reason for this sense, and yet there seems to be more at play here. At first, it is the man who appears to be telling the story and then there is a shift. Things become a bit more personal. The &quot;you&quot; is employed in both specific and general ways. The narrator is no longer clear, and neither is the person being addressed (though I assume it to be a woman). Gautier seems to be both lamenting the expendable nature of the addressee and at the same time accusing her for her complacency.]]></description>
