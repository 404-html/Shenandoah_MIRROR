					<description><![CDATA[Doesn&#039;t move me.  Nor even spark amusement.  Dry.
Noticing a trend in poetry now, to be dropping the articles of speech (sort of like years ago,
when they started being so &quot;cool,&quot; dropping punctuation for run on sentences and phrases;
oh, well...).  

In (blank) fire marshall&#039;s... (blank) car in (blank) carport.  Have begun to notice quite a bit of this sort of writing cropping up lately.  Reminds me of the internet, where i substitutes for I.
Must have been for the metrical cadence, I guess.  What do I know?  
(In music, they&#039;ve already  replaced singing with screaming.)]]></description>
