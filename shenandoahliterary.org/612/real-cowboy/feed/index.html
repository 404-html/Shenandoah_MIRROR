					<description><![CDATA[The ending to this story makes me so happy. The entire time I was reading, I felt like Kate was teetering on the boundary between childhood and adulthood. Her frequent allusions to the  dark relationships surrounding her--between the stallion and the mare and between her own parents--made me almost certain that she was going to be torn from her naiveté in a violent way that would leave her in the same cynical and hardened state in which her parents seem to be stuck. Was she going to try to understand the genesis of her parent&#039;s failed relationship by using Lloyd as a substitute for her father? Even worse, was Lloyd going to take advantage of her insecurity and innocence? Sappenfield brought me to this precipice and made me almost 100% certain that this was a story about the impossibility of mature, respectful love. That&#039;s why Lloyd&#039;s reaction was so splendid. I had forgotten that there was an alternative to the brutal companionship evinced by the horses and Kate&#039;s parents. Lloyd, for no apparent reason except an inherent goodness, chooses to be like John. Sappenfield artfully tricks the reader into a state of disenchantment, only to reveal an inherent virtue, making us all the more appreciative of human goodness.]]></description>
