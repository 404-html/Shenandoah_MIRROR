					<description><![CDATA[Cool and clear.  Precise, and full of nostalgia.  Makes one wonder how does a human being bear such an existence?  (To write a poem?  Surely, more than that.)  Reminded me of a few short weeks I worked one Christmas season at a postal facility; while not working at 
a machine, one became as one, standing in one spot sorting cards and letters into the letter slots, and living for the &quot;breaks.&quot;  Dear God, the things one must do to pay bills and provide for necessities!  Enough to drive an intelligent person to suicide -- .  And so many people do it, day in and day out.  I&#039;ve never figured out &quot;how.&quot;  Like being a Roman slave, a remanent of war.  Well-written poem, indeed, that says something.  (So many things written today, and passed off as literature... pass me off as a human being; thus I no longer think too much of &quot;literature&quot; as something I need to worry with, anymore.  It has become like the corporate world: so much BS and bluster.  At least that&#039;s how I see most poetry in journals, these days.
Whatever happened to the Frosts and Sandburgs?  Those... were readable poets!  The rest are notably lost, and will be buried forever, in mostly non-descript, non-remembered libraries.]]></description>
