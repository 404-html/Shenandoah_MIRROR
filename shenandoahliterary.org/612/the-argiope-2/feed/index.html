					<description><![CDATA[The poem  takes its time, its nervous too like someone getting ready to cross a flooded creek, one foot on a slippery rock, then the plank, then safe on the other side knowing you laid down your life for the show. Good job!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To stop at &quot;unthinkable&quot; would have confined the thought to the now; and what is really
unthinkable to a very young child?  Thinking, itself, is really not even thought of... in kindergarten; but only in the reflected gaze of a later looking back... one might read into
the exquisitely caught expression, as if one were truly looking forward beyond the moment, into a &quot;what&quot; we can never truly foresee.
Since &quot;argiope&quot; isn&#039;t in my dictionary, and I&#039;m not into spiders/insects, I didn&#039;t give it much mind (nor do I care for poets using obscure language to express anything -- ), I rather let it slide with the tide of simply a here-today-gone-tomorrow inevitability... which, of course, slips neatly into the end frame of thinking: we never know, or knew, what possibly is ahead for any of us.  Even a captured frown/questioning look on a face in a photograph tells us little... but it sets the stage for all sorts of pondering over, after.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Going on&quot; is unthinkable for a child.  She knows her life will be changing (&quot;in her new kindergarten dress&quot;) but she does not yet understand how.   The other children in the photo are caught in the &quot;now&quot; of that moment, but the &quot;one caught in a worried look&quot; is aware that things she cannot imagine are ahead of her.   &quot;Going on&quot; is what makes the last line powerful, and connects it to the first section of the poem, where the argiope will soon die and her eggs will go on into a future she cannot experience.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lovely poem to read and to hear. I questioned the final phrase &quot;going on.&quot; I invite other poets to educate me. Why can&#039;t this poem end with the word &quot;unthinkable&quot;?  Looking forward to any responses.]]></description>
