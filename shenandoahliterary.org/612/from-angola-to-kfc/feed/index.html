					<description><![CDATA[I really like this piece of work from Jackson Lassiter, particularly the last part titled &quot;Original Or Extra-Crispy?&quot; I really like the anaphora with the word &quot;recognize&quot; that discusses how Sholanda does not recognize the relationship between her ancestors and fried chicken, hip hop, and her roots. Lassiter does a fantastic job of highlighting the importance of &quot;agency&quot; to add a layer of irony to the story. Sholanda&#039;s roots would give her a type of claim on the atmospherics of her environment--the chicken, hip hop, etc.-- yet, they serve as tools to oppress her rather than liberate her because she does not command any ownership over these ancestral accoutrements. This is a great commentary on personal identity and how one&#039;s own cultural reportoire can be turned against oneself.]]></description>
