								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reviewed by Lauren Starnes, WLU &#8217;12</p>
<p>Charles Frazier’s haunting new novel, <em>Nightwoods</em> paints a poignant portrait of love and survival in the unforgiving North Carolina Mountains.  Rather than the nineteenth-century setting of his previous novels, <em>Cold Mountain</em> and <em>Thirteen Moons</em>, Frazier sets this tale in the late 1950s.  Despite this change, however, everything from his characters to his writing feels reminiscent of the otherworldly and Gothic mood of his earlier novels.  The story centers on Luce, a young woman who lives a solitary life.  Luce becomes the guardian of her sister’s twin children after the youngsters witness their mother’s brutal murder by their stepfather, Bud.  Within this already compelling narrative of suspense and mystery, Frazier interweaves tensions between Luce and her absent parents as well as a fledgling romance.  Oddly enough, the most remarkable facet of <em>Nightwoods</em> ends up being the relationship between the eerie twins and their ruthless and unrelenting stepfather.</p>
<p>Initially, the story, like its protagonist, is seemingly unembellished and simple, but as the book goes on it becomes clear that there are darker forces at work.  Luce is content with her hermit-like existence working as the caretaker of the dilapidated Wyah lodge, conveniently located deep in the Appalachian Mountains.  Frazier’s depiction of the children is both sympathetic and haunting.  When they first arrive at Luce’s doorstep, Frazier describes them as “Not really glaring, but with the manner of looking at you and yet not at you.  Predatory&#8230;scoping their surroundings for whatever next prospect might present itself, but not wanting to spook anybody.  Not yet.&#8221;  Soon the ostensibly mute youngsters reveal their inclination toward violence and fire.  They make short work of two roosters, and it does not take long for the twins to steal away and set fire to a nearby cabin.  Thanks to Frank, Dolores, and their silent chaos, Luce is transformed from a hermit-in-training to a teacher, warden, and firefighter.</p>
<p>Frazier’s writing is at its best when he portrays the novel’s most chilling characters.  Like his rendering of Dolores and Frank, the author’s depiction of Bud, the children’s vicious stepfather and their mother’s murderer, proves to be surprisingly captivating.  After he is acquitted of murder&#8211;thanks to the efforts of a wily lawyer&#8211; Bud pursues the children because he believes they know the location of some stolen money.  He ends up befriending many people in the nearby town, including Luce’s own father who is the local deputy.  Frazier makes it clear that Bud is a bloodthirsty psychopath. In fact, Bud resembles one of Cormac McCarthy’s villains, but with a background and a sliver of a soul.  Furthermore, Frazier makes it obvious that Bud has already traumatized the twins in unspeakable ways, which makes the scenes involving these three individuals all the more fascinating.  In the end, Frazier crafts three characters who collectively end up stealing the scene from the protagonist.</p>
<p>Occasionally, Frazier goes overboard with the archaic language and extensive musings on the beauty of nature. Nevertheless, <em>Nightwoods</em> is a fast-paced read.  Particularly in the last third of the narrative, Frazier creates a wonderfully suspenseful story.  After an exceptionally bone-chilling encounter with Bud, the twins flee into the mountains, with both Luce and Bud in hot pursuit.  Eventually, Luce squares off against Bud in order to protect the children she now loves.  Ultimately, in <em>Nightwoods</em> Frazier crafts a genuinely memorable and exciting story of love, violence, and the awe-inspiring power of nature.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Touch </em>by  Henri Cole (FSG, NY, 2011)</p>
<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/612/files/2012/03/coletouch.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-665" title="coletouch" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/612/files/2012/03/coletouch.jpeg" alt="" width="183" height="275" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the absence of end rhymes, the voice in each of Henri Cole’s otherwise sonnet-like poems rises like ether from moist, cold ground. The separate parts mingle and merge, doing what the title suggests: they touch. Like a transparent vase, the poems are given just enough architecture for the naked experiences to appear within them. While his colloquial, accessible voice makes the poems easy to read, they are emotionally difficult because he offers the reader an unblinkered glimpse into his reality.</p>
<p>The three sections of the book focus on (as the dust jacket tells us) “&#8230;a mother’s death, a lover’s addiction, war…” Section I, titled <em>Don’t be an open book, Mother</em>, contains the title poem, “Touch.” This poem radically breaks away from the sonnet form, employing indentations and varying stanza lengths. It economically evokes the image of the “I” lying in a pine box by using relatively short lines and a simplicity that strikes by its directness.</p>
<p>In a hospital morgue,</p>
<p>I lay in a pine box</p>
<p>propped in a simple tiled room</p>
<p>This matter-of-fact voice continues to assert itself, creating a visceral experience of what it must feel like to be in a coffin. “White satin covered me to the waist / and was crudely stapled / around the edges of the coffin.” The reader can see the uneven staples, the sloppy attention paid to the elegant satin. This crudeness asks us to look at our attempts to beautify the dead. Cole can be with his mother only if he enters the casket with her, further evidenced in the third stanza:</p>
<p>Then I lay down beside you,</p>
<p>dissolving loneliness,</p>
<p>and the white maggots wriggled.</p>
<p>He ends with:</p>
<p>Though they didn’t know where they were going</p>
<p>they made the prettiest song of all.</p>
<p>These last two lines are absolutely earned. If we were to lift them out of the context of the poem, they’d appear platitudinous, especially “the prettiest song of all.” But here, they bloom with a poignant ache.</p>
<p>Throughout the collection, Cole turns his back on artifice. Whatever truths his book offers leap out of the poems’ blue-collar hours. His speaker seems unfettered by shame as he maps his vulnerability awakening in dark places. This commitment to “telling it like it is” deepens his poetry. The title of the poem, “Resistance,” strikes me as ironic, as the poem speaks more to the <em>inability</em> to resist, the opposing concepts facing each other the way the lovers in the poem do in the same torn bed. He tells us, “I didn’t go to him for virtue” and “I wanted to know what it felt like, eating honey like a wasp.” I’ve been told that wasps don’t eat honey, and I wondered if this were an oversight on Cole’s part, if he’d gotten his facts wrong. However, he may have intentionally used this waspy falseness to suggest the speaker’s spurned desire in the poem, his not really making love any more than a wasp really eats honey. Or perhaps he was trying to walk the thin line between the polarities of sweetness and sting. He gives in to his desire to taste what his drug-addled lover tastes, even if that includes the shame that goes with it. He makes an art of his willingness to lose everything and doesn’t dilute the power of that choice by anesthetizing the language: “Loser old man u r a cheap cunt,” he writes. “I need coke. Unless ur buying, the answer is no.”</p>
<p>Cole constantly goes back to questions of the self: what it is, where it can go, or who it becomes in relation to outward events and the collision of consciousness. Is he referring to Christ or himself in “The Flagellation” when he says, “I am afraid to fall down, / but I will not be dominated”? Through this highly-accomplished collection, Cole shows us that he will not be dominated, that he won’t give in to anything but his personal version of the untrammeled truth.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"><em>Looking for the Gulf Motel</em> by Richard Blanco (Pittsburgh, 2012)</p>
<p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">Scene:<em> pile of recent poetry volumes, all surely deserving fond attention. Bleary reviewer browses one for a while, sighs, puts it down, and repeats this behavior with several more. After she opens to the middle of the sixth, she jumps as if jolted by electricity. The reviewer laughs, turns to the beginning, and begins to read straight through.</em></p>
<p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">Extremely boring theater, but it illuminates how the author-reader loop gets wired. The voltage came from Richard Blanco’s prose poem, “Afternoons as Endora”:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">I’m a boy who hates being a boy who loves cats and paint-by-number sets. She’s a witch who loves being a witch who hates mortals&#8230; I paint my fingernails crayon-red, wrap a towel around my head like her bouffant, tie my sheets around my chest into a chiffon muumuu just like hers, the bedspread draped over my shoulders like her mauve cape.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">In this case, weird identity slippages closed the circuit. For me the role model was Samantha—I remember the witch in human drag controlling everybody and only pretending to feel guilty about it, although I haven’t checked on <em>Bewitched</em> recently—but in any case, Blanco had me. “Afternoons as Endora” is not the best poem in the book, but it performed the essential magic. Seventies childhood, misfit pretending to power, uncanny games of dress-up: I recognize them. It’s just as unlikely for me to see myself in Blanco as it was for Blanco to see himself in Endora, so the connections I perceived are probably illusory, but they worked. I like being rattled and confused, but only if I have some sense of the person performing the tricks; otherwise the poems are just dead spells.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">The title poem of Blanco’s third collection, “Looking for the Gulf Motel,” inaugurates his dominant themes: memory, place, and longing to revisit an unrecoverable past. For Blanco, a civil engineer and a prize-winning poet, this means a Cuban-American childhood that once embarrassed and distressed him. Escape involves assimilation to some TV-inspired fantasy of Americanness (being “not Ricardo but Richard”) but also flight from his grandmother’s criticisms of his suspiciously effeminate tastes and habits. Blanco conjures home primarily through relationships. This is as much a suite of love poems as a meditation n displacement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">This book’s formal variety and vivid sensorium are attractive. Sometimes Blanco’s sentences are a little too straightforward for me; I prefer sleight-of-hand to declarations such as “I confess I pitied you” (“The Island Within”). But his elegies for his father are exceptionally powerful: the extended sentence of “The Port Pilot” is movingly breathless, and again, I recognize the loving, angry resistance of “Bones, Teeth.” Whatever metaphor one uses—electricity, enchantment—Blanco’s poems conduct a potent spark. <span> </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in;"><em><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Waking </span></em><span style="font-size: 13pt;">by Ron Rash (Hub City Press, 2011)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in;">Reviewed by Philip Belcher<span style="font-size: 13pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><span>            </span></span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Since I first read “Under Jocassee” in Ron Rash’s 2002 collection <em>Raising the Dead</em> and followed the speaker’s urging to look beneath my boat and into an Appalachian valley long since flooded, I have understood that this poet is fully awake to his environment and to his heritage.<span>  </span>The poems in <em>Waking</em> reinforce that conviction and illustrate that Rash continues to find and relish instances of revelation in the juxtaposition of Appalachian history and landscape.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><span>            </span>Although these days Rash is recognized predominately for his fiction (coming soon to a theatre near you), I am glad to see this new collection of poetry, his first in nine years.<span>  </span>Readers of the poems in <em>Waking</em> will understand the vast popularity of Rash’s fiction; he is a fine storyteller.<span>  </span>Set almost entirely in Western North Carolina, the poems in form and content evoke the struggle of that region’s settlers, including the poet’s ancestors.<span>  </span>Rash builds nearly all of the collection around a seven-syllable line.<span>  </span>He is not a slave to the syllabic form, but he is more than devoted to it, and the short line generally serves him well.<span>  </span>Although I occasionally longed for just one more article, pronoun, or preposition to smooth a terse line, the effect of the form is to emphasize the frugal nature of Rash’s characters, the hardships they endure, their meager expectations, the permeable membrane between them and peril.<span>  </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><span>            </span>Even within their formal economy, however, these poems are made rich through thematic variety and Rash’s facility with arresting imagery.<span>  </span>Readers will find that the motif of water is as prevalent as the collection’s underlying theme: the relationship between living and being fully awake.<span>  </span>In addition to multiple meditations aided by reference to the Watauga River in northwestern North Carolina, readers are treated to riveting narratives of water’s hazards: a drowned girl whose body cannot be retrieved (“The Girl in the River”), the father who loses his savings while freeing his son from the rapids (“The Wallet”), a trout found alive in a burning tree (“Resonance”), and an infant daughter rescued after a flood leaves her snagged in an oak with her father’s belt buckle on her chest.<span>  </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Finely wrought images are everywhere in these poems, images that grab the reader by the sleeve and demand another reading.<span>  </span>In “Woman Among Lightening: Catawba County Fair, 1962,” the speaker describes a storm, “clouds glowing like blown coals,” and the Ferris wheel “dredging buckets of darkness / out of the sky . . . .”<span>  </span>In “When Serpents Came,” Rash places two brothers in a trench in World War I and has them remember rattlesnakes that “flowed down the face of Whiterock / like hellish tears . . . .”<span>  </span>The poet challenges the reader’s ability to track the thematic layers of these poems.<span>  </span>Among, or should I say beneath, these startling images and engaging narratives, the reader will find Rash summoning his Welsh ancestors in poems like “Genealogy,” “Dylan Thomas,” “Emrys,” and “Rhiannon,” an allusion I last heard from Stevie Nicks and was delighted to find redeemed here.<span>  </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><span>            </span>Rash knits the collection together with syllabics, but that form is inseparable from one of his obvious themes: his ethnic history.<span>  </span>Just a little research reveals, for example, that ancient Welsh poetry was often syllabic.<span>  </span>By building this volume on the seven syllable line, Rash makes it clear that structure is not a subsidiary concern.<span>  </span>He uses a form that might be severe and infuses it with such a rich diversity of thematic currents and images that the vigilant reader will leave the collection with the impression of a place that is lush, of a people and a time that still matter.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal"> <em>Dining </em><em>with</em><em>Robert Redford &amp; Other Stories</em><em><span style="font-style: normal;">.</span> </em>By Tamra Wilson (Bristol, Virginia: Little Creek Books, 2011)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Reviewed by Heather Duerre Humann</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">If you take a dash of wit, a pinch of humor, and combine them with an eclectic assortment of lively Southern characters, you get <em>Dining with Robert Redford &amp; Other Stories</em>. Tamra Wilson’s debut short story collection <em><span style="font-style: normal;">is a delightful book that offers glimpses into the day-to-day lives of folks from many different walks of life through its diverse grouping of largely dialogue-driven sketches.<span>  </span>A particular strength of Wilson’s is her talent for convincingly and sympathetically giving voice to her characters, a feature of her writing which not only helps to develop her stories’ characters and make them more realistic, but which also allows Wilson to showcase her ability to compellingly construct multiple narrative voices.<span>  </span>This skill, along with Wilson’s ability to hone in on the extraordinary moments in ordinary characters’ lives, makes this collection both readable and relatable.<br />
</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><em><span style="font-style: normal;">Though all of the selections are set in the contemporary South, Wilson’s stories contain a hodgepodge of working- and middle-class characters.<span>  </span>These range from Kim Walden, a dream interpreter from the opening story “The Smoking Cuban Woman,” <span> </span>to hair stylists, factory workers, deacons, and office clerks, like two of the women who appear in the story “Cross Training” – <span> </span>Doreen, who works “in receivables,” and Tillie, who does “payables” (148).<span>  </span>Stories also feature small business owners, such as Cliff Hastings, owner of Quality Rent-A-Car, a man goaded by his wife into mistakenly believing that they’ve spotted Robert Redford at a local restaurant in “Dining with Robert Redford.” <span> </span>Cliff, prodded into doing so by his wife, Alma, interrupts a man they take to be the celebrity as he is eating his meal.<span>  </span>Only after getting his autograph do they learn from their server that the man was really Mr. Richards, a real estate agent who “just plays along” when “people mistake him” for Robert Redford (61).</span></em></p>
<p>The theme of dining runs throughout many of this collection’s stories, as the book’s title implies.<span>  </span>Indeed, food figures significantly into many of the selections, from “Democrat Cake,” which recounts how a cake baked by Charlene, a staunch democrat, ends up going home with the Republican governor’s wife, to “Squirrel Supper,” a story about sharing an unconventional meal with friends. Dining plays a major role in the story “Dick and Rhoda,” as well.<span>  </span>An account of an aunt and her middle-aged nephew who live under the same roof coming to blows at the dinner table, this story reveals the intergenerational friction that is common in so many families, and it demonstrates how mealtime—for some families, the only time when real communication happens—can bring veiled hostilities to the surface.<span>  </span>For many years, Rhoda tried the “sugar-coated approach to improving” her nephew, but had “failed miserably” (189).<span>  </span>She finally has enough of him when he brings an uninvited guest to dinner—and she lets him know as much.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em><span style="font-style: normal;">Beyond the dining theme, many other elements of day-to-day life help to build the conflicts within the stories in this collection.<span>  </span>For example, “Priscilla the Meatpacker” revolves around a mother learning the results of her teenage daughter’s “standardized Career Pathways test” (17).<span>  </span>“Running on Empty” is a story about a young woman who has to stop to refill her car’s gas tank in the midst of having a severe wardrobe crisis.<span>  </span>Both of these stories demonstrate Wilson’s talent for recognizing the humor and grace of ordinary life.</span></em></p>
<p><span>            </span>Indeed, Tamra Wilson should be commended for her ability to take everyday encounters and turn them into extraordinary stories.<span>  </span>In all, Wilson’s Dining<em>with</em><em>Robert</em><em>Redford</em><em>&amp;</em><em>Other</em><em>Stories</em><em><span style="font-style: normal;"> is an impressive debut. Though she touches on a range of subjects throughout this collection, all of the stories are readable, engaging, and full of humor—and are sure to appeal to a wide readership.</span></em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The 6.5 Practices of Moderately Successful Poets: A Self-Help Memoir</em> by Jeffrey Skinner (Sarabande)</p>
<p>When I first glanced at this book, I was ready to dismiss it: I don’t care for contemporary memoirs of many sorts,  litbiz  as a subject has no appeal, and self-help books don’t usually achieve their putative aim.  Skinner’s book, however, contained another ingredient, an intriguing one.  He worked in security and investigation when he was young, and since I’ve worked for Pinkerton and Wackenhut myself, I wondered what somebody who’d snooped and guarded for an actual living brought to the art of poetry.</p>
<p>Major disclosure: Skinner doesn’t go into the seedy or technical side of catchy cases.  Instead, he concentrates more on the mundane, punch-the-clock aspect of the industry and on some people he met while working for and then with his father.  He also keeps reminding us that conducting surveillance is one thing any writer has to do steadily.  One quirky bit of info he brings our way from the private eye world is that, in the course of his work, he met a cousin of Robert Bly who revealed that Bly was backed by a trust fund and had never actually held a job.  I assume a private eye would trace this scuttlebutt down and that it’s trustworthy information.</p>
<p>Much of the time with <em>The 6.5</em> I was reading fast, looking for nuggets and sly bits, and he’s discovered an amusing way to reveal how he came to be a poet and found a niche in that world.  Occasionally, however, I ran across something radiant and arresting.  From the title of the book and chapters, from his half-goofy top ten lists and his letters to Dr. Frankenpoet section, I knew he was out to have some fun, but when Skinner writes about what poets must do and be prepared for, he sometimes exceeds the predictable answers.  For instance, when pondering what we want from poetry, he delivers some provocative and memorable phrases, like “a coherent and specific originality.”  He’s also good on why one can’t become “new” through “craft or ideological positioning.”  “The genuinely new,” he writes, “has a restless temperament and is congenitally dissatisfied.”  Many writers say something like this, but I think he hits it dead on.</p>
<p>By the end of the book, I (arrogantly, I guess) wished that Skinner had written, instead of this hybrid, three separate pieces: a substantial autobiographical essay about gumshoeing and learning to write, a witty (and he can do that) satire on the “creative writing world” and its foolishness, and finally a textbook on writing poetry – not for classes, but just for engaged people who want some guidance in learning to write poems, without any ambitions to get into the game or spend a fortune collecting an MFA.  Maybe he’s done these, but up to now I’ve just been a reader of his poems, which I often admire.  From now on, though, I’ll be keeping my eye out for his prose.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">A High Wind in Jamaica</span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"> by Richard Hughes (New York Rev. Books, 1999).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">The current revival of <em>A High Wind in Jamaica</em> encourages me to believe that we haven’t devolved to a state in which all novels about young people have to be market-driven absurdities in which every character (usually with some werewolf, Pekinese or waffle iron lurking inside) acts and thinks like a pre-teen in a cell phone commercial or a day-trading infant.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">Perhaps the gleam of hope, however twisted, is due in part that the pirate Captain Jonsen and his mate Otto are adults and complicated in very different ways from the Bas-Thornton children whose adventures and trials drive the book’s primary narrative.<span>  </span>When adults an author presents are simultaneously culpable and vulnerable, it may be harder to make the children formulaic.<span>  </span>Of course, this novel originally appeared in 1929, so it may be closer kin to the children in <em>The Turn of the Screw</em> than to <em>Twilight</em>.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">Anyone who knows neither the book nor the film version may be wincing a bit.<span>  </span>Yes, it’s a tale of English children taken hostage by pirates, though a third of the book is devoted to their feral adventures on Jamaica under the loose supervision of their parents and to the aftermath of the captivity, either sequestering in the claustrophobic hold or larking about, free as chimps in the rigging.<span>  </span>And what strange imp-children these are, especially ten-year-old Emily, who is just beginning to understand what it means to be a distinct person, a powerful “I” outside the games and roles she inhabits and who is the author of many of the inscrutable acts of violence and mercy.<span>  </span>Pirates, yes, but Emily is no Jim Hawkins.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">The novel presents these idiosyncratic and imaginative children first in the lush and exotic tropics, shaken by earthquakes, threatened by a hurricane, surrounded by servants and serpents and clueless English adults.<span>  </span>They operate almost as a cult with its own system of taboos and holies, and the genius loci is a fierce cat named Tabby, assailed by wilder beings during a lightning fusillade, and who screeches about “with a tone of voice the children had never heard before and which made their blood run cold.”<span>  </span>This is where Hughes goes over the top, as he often does, with language which still never quite loses its voltage and prevents the reader from believing this is an adventure story of the usual sort: “He seemed like one inspired in the presence of Death, he had gone utterly Delphic: and without in the passage Hell’s pandemonium ruled terrifically.”<span>  </span>Not easy going, this syntax, but it serves as a reminder that the children have something of the demonic about them.<span>  </span>The braid of innocence and wiliness have much to do with the flavor of this novel in which the pirate crew and the gaggle (or perhaps “pride”) of children alternate between peaceful playfulness and terrorizing one another.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">Just as the pirates begin as exotics to the children, soon the children’s spontaneity and the complexity of their fantasies and gambits make them exotic to their captors.<span>  </span>As in most approach-avoidance relationships, the power dynamics are bizarre, as are the unstable moral standards.<span>  </span>As Francine Prose asserts in her introduction to this edition, the violence, betrayal and sexuality in this novel come at surprising times and in counterintuitive ways.<span>  </span>Anyone who believes that <em>Lord of the Flies</em> reveals how children, becoming their own law, turn dark is in for a deepening sense of the mysteries of youth as the barque, whose name is never more permanent than its most recent paint job, suffers larger sea changes than its crew imagined possible.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">Many readers will be familiar with the film version of <em>A High Wind in Jamaica</em>, which has its own virtues and shortcomings, simplifying the mysteries of dream and fever by presenting a superstitious crew always fearful that <em>duppies</em> from the dead will curse them.<span>   </span>Anthony Quinn, perhaps channeling Zorba, makes for an intriguing rogue captain, but it’s not enough to make up for the loss of Emily’s consciousness, which creates most of the tone and texture of the novel – alternately hallucinogenic and rational, especially with its nautical riches.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">As a novelist, Hughes is a peculiar mixture of craftsman, savant and amateur.<span>  </span>He is capable of marvelous, hypnotic prose, but can also write a sentence like this: “But it was not her, it was the meal which raped Jose’s attention.”<span>  </span>Even Homer nodded, but details also get tangled, as “the ship’s monkey” becomes the novel’s focus briefly and meets a startling end.<span>  </span>Not long afterward another monkey appears, with no introduction or explanation.<span>  </span>Most frustrating of all is the inconsistency or narrative voice.<span>  </span>Throughout most of the tale, the narrator is allowed access to the minds of the characters, but at some junctures, he (or “it”) confesses in a manner reminiscent of Fielding that a particular motive or outcome is beyond his knowledge or understanding.<span>  </span>And yet, the raw power and contained hysteria of the story make these errors forgivable.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">What this book witnesses about decaying imperialism and the parallel decline of a certain brand of outlawry is mostly implicit, but delegates from the Wordsworth and Rousseau schools of natural childhood should beware.<span>  </span>Though the narrator cites, and seems to concur with, Southey in his description of psychology as “the Art Bablative,” the novel is rife with invitations to unriddle the knots of personality amid the deceptions, inventions and misunderstandings that create a weather more discernible than typhoons and sweaty, becalmed nights on the bowsprit.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">As the somewhat ineffectual pirate crew and the tribe of children come to accept their cohabitation at sea, the tale takes quietly shocking turns, mixing the intoxicating rum and luxuriant molasses of Jamaica, though which represents the hostage children and which the renegades is not so easy to say. One thing is certain: <em>A High Wind in Jamaica</em> is surprising, provocative, exciting and moving, a book that reminds us that some mysteries do not lend themselves to solution or resolution.<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><em>The Accident</em>, by Mihail Sebastian, trans. Stephen Henighan (Biblioasis, 2011)</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"> </span></p>
<p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">What gets imprinted upon a work of fiction when society is unraveling all around the writer? This is a question I grappled with while reading Mihail Sebastian’s fourth and last novel, <em>The Accident</em>, his first work of fiction to appear in English. Sebastian (1907-1945) first made waves in the English reading world when his Journal 1935-1944: The Fascist Years was translated in 2000. In that work, the novelist, playwright, and lawyer observed the literati around him growing increasingly right-wing as anti-Semitic legislation passed, legislation that (as Henighan helpfully explains in his Afterword to <em>The Accident</em>) expelled him from the bar association and the Romanian Academy, and took away his right to publish.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">In <em>The Accident</em>, set in 1934 and originally published in 1940, Paul, a suicidal lawyer tries to forget Anna, a blond, blue-eyed waif of a painter. Instead, he meets Nora, a sturdy French teacher, after she falls off a tram – in a scene rendered with incredibly precise aural and tactile detail. Paul helps Nora, and despite his insufferable, depressed shrugs, their carefully-etched love story is off with a lurch. Nora convinces him to take a holiday to shake off his despair. They leave Bucharest to ski in Transylvania, except Paul has never skied before and Nora must teach him. There’s something transcendental to Paul’s hurtling through the blinding snow – he would be content to hurtle and continue a sensation of floating and brightness – but, irritatingly, Nora forces him to learn control.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">The opposition of a waifish, scatterbrained, younger Anna with the sensitive, wanting-to-be-noticed and almost-a-spinster-but-not Nora risks veering toward stereotype, but Sebastian avoids this through carefully considered interior monologues that alternate at satisfying intervals between Nora and Paul. And, the story might have felt a bit thin if it centered solely on this trio, but it gathers richness up in the forested mountains, where Nora and Paul encounter the young Gunther Grodek and his family, of the Saxon minority in Transylvania.  The Grodeks are a tight-lipped bunch, but a parallel story of love, ambition, obligation, and loss slowly arises, one more difficult to grasp because we only enter the minds of Nora and Paul, but one whose mystery adds an important texture to the story. When Nora and Paul return to Braşov, the regional capital at the base of the mountains, and when Paul encounters and misunderstands the import of Hungarian headlines (Hungarians are another minority in Transylvania), the sense of the story widens out, casting a darker edge to the novel.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><em>The Accident</em> glimpses a lost world of inter-war, pre-Communist Romania, and it also delicately foreshadows the war. Celebratory imagery is often eerily militaristic, such as when popping champagne corks are described as “detonation” and droves of holiday skiers, dressed in similar ski suits and piled into special skiers’ train cars, are compared to troops.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Even setting historical background aside, <em>The Accident</em> remains a powerful work of art. Descriptions of landscape are lush (“Clouds flowed down towards Poiana like buoyant lava”), encounters with local fauna glint with incandescent magic, and the reader is intimately engaged with Nora and Paul – the undulations of their fears and their doubts, their desires and, however ephemeral, their exaltations.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nick Ripatrazone</p>
<p><em>The Glass Crib</em> by Amanda Auchter. Zone 3 Press, 2011.</p>
<p>“There is no pain but the bodily”: so begins “The Ecstasy of Saint Theresa,” the final in a sequence of saint-themed poems in <em>The Glass Crib</em>, Amanda Auchter’s debut collection. Theresa’s claim is reflected throughout a book concerned with the corporal. Auchter saves her persona poems of those canonized for the final quarter of the book, but the entire work is a document of variations of sainthood: human imperfection cleansed through the gift of enduring faith.</p>
<p>Imperfect mothers&#8211;sometimes nearly burdened by pregnancy&#8211;populate <em>The Glass Crib</em>, and their laments coalesce: “As you grow older, / do not imagine me&#8211; / you will never get it right.” “A Late Blooming,” a heartbreaking poem that practically justifies the entire collection, encapsulates the complexity of birth. Auchter artfully directs the poem toward the later absent mother, and the lines carry so much regret:</p>
<p>For months<br />you fed me air, vodka, saltines, small</p>
<p>unnoticeable meals, enough for you<br />to gain just ten pounds of water, the pale<br />tissues of my heartbeat and bones.</p>
<p>“Vodka,” tucked mid-line, increases its strength. Auchter creates such frailty in the pregnant form, and wonders: what, exactly, does a mother owe a child? “Ten pounds of water” gained in this pregnancy meant a life barely changed, at least physically, and yet a world of internal metamorphosis. The poem turns back to an earlier work in the book by stating, almost in whisper, that “I want to think / of you better than you were.” The desire is not empty fantasy: although the narrator’s birth mother “pushed through the doors” of the adoption agency “into / the February dusk,” offering her child to another family, the absolute connection of birth is never lessened by distance. The child, rather than living in anger, would rather think “of how / you spoke to me when no one was listening.”</p>
<p>Auchter returns to the particular pain of separation in “Limbo for the Miscarry” and “Childless,” where another mother “was not / thinking of the daughter my body / could not grow.” Faced with an inability to birth, this mother continues on, steadfast, almost fighting against an indiscriminate evil that steals life: “I will not eat for two. I will not leave the house / with bags of Cheerios or crackers or stash / juice boxes in my purse.” The proclamation turns blunt: “There will be no / vomit, shit, hungry crying at 3 am.”<br />Anger is to be expected from such loss, but this is an anger of forward action, not static mourning. In “To the Unborn,” the mundane action of the character, to “wash and dry this / basket of apples” is sometimes enough to satiate heavy memory. One of Auchter’s skills in <em>The Glass Crib</em> is to coax grief anew, as the narrator notes “each version of you spools / in the red scarves, the names / I wrote down, then erased.”</p>
<p>In the second section of the book, “Without,” Auchter turns from maternal elegies to meditations on lost siblings. “Extreme Unction” crafts the deliberate action of blessing, and the narrator knows that though “all of this can be repaired&#8211; / fingers splinted, bones unbroken / again,” she accepts that there is “something lost on her face / I can’t get back.” Scars are given pulse by memory, and are sometimes further wound by time, and those left behind to grieve must either remain in the stasis of pain or turn elsewhere. In “O Sinner Come Home,” the narrator leaves “the dirty sink, the casserole dish. Mother / with her stack of forks, a rosary,” and most importantly “the white sheet covering my brother’s body.” Her “teenaged self” leaves absolute pain for temporary love, and her “lover’s mouth erases what can be erased.” The reader is compelled to forgive the narrator’s decision.<br />This call for compassion continues in “The Bottom Drawer,” where idiosyncratic grief is made acceptable and necessary. A mother keeps her son’s pajamas after he has passed, and the narrator wonders if “she wears them . . . if at night she slips / into bed with the shirt, cradles him / back into her.” “Keepsake” dramatizes another unusual collection: hair. A trunk is found “filled with the comb-teeth / scrapings, scraps of baby-wisps, my knotted / snarls.”</p>
<p>The tendency to save and assign meaning feels iconographic, and prepares the reader for the final section of the book, “Bring Splendor.” <em>The Glass Crib</em> is the newest in a revival of the Catholic poetic aesthetic. Sarah Vap’s <em>Faulkner’s Rosary</em>, Mary Biddinger’s <em>Saint Monica</em>, and C. Dale Young’s <em>Torn</em> appropriate the ritual, imagery, and cadence of Roman Catholicism in a complicated manner. These contemporary poets, along with Auchter, move from strict orthodoxy and craft works far stronger than devotional verse, and yet they all find solace in the corporal lexicon of the religion.</p>
<p>A woman considers adultery, but ultimately chooses to remain faithful. A mother implores her frustrated daughter to “offer it up,” and she does, her “knees to the floor / [to] give it all back to the God / who asked me to bear it.” These are people who struggle to remain faithful to God and family, and yet who find salvation in those same places. “Bring Splendor” transitions from everyday flashes of faith to the travails of those later canonized into legend. Auchter’s saints suffer. Saint Agatha’s “flesh / spooled in [a knife’s] rusted light.” Saint Cecilia, later incorrupt, remained with “roped hands” in a room with “no window, / but stone walls” for days until her death. Saint Catherine’s pain is even worse: “how my bones break, how the sling- / shot twangs and splits / my lip.” When Catherine “ask[s] of death,” she does so not to stop the torture, but to embrace the beyond of her belief.</p>
<p>These poems are not mere documentation of bodily suffering. The Catholic literary aesthetic has always revered the pained person of Christ&#8211;from the whisky priest in Graham Greene’s <em>The Power and the Glory</em> to the stigmatic novitiate in Ron Hansen’s <em>Mariette in Ecstasy</em>&#8211;finding unfortunate beauty in the desire to self-sacrifice. Auchter’s saint-themed poems lead into the powerful “Glossolalia,” where the lines “Let me speak of belief, / its small sounds in the distance, its ear / its tongue, the quite murmur of flood and field” feel appropriate to encapsulate the entire collection. <em>The Glass Crib</em> is an honest book of poetry, where imperfect narrators and subjects abound, and yet a certain hope arises from these lines, a hope coaxed into life by the poet’s care with words and her subjects.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The Outlaw Album</em> by Daniel Woodrell (Little, Brown)</p>
<p>The first two Daniel Woodrell novels I read were engaging but discomfiting portraits of redneck miscreants which never fully satisfied because Woodrell is inclined to let his Ozark characters at important moments to wax eloquent in elevated diction and intricate syntax unbefitting the backgrounds and natures he has furnished them with. <em>Winter’s Bone</em> was cleaner, less flawed, built around a character of convincing gravity and grace, and I was fully won over. The best stories of his aptly-titled collection <em>The Outlaw Album</em> are reminiscent of that latter book, and the other stories spieled by narrators who can’t completely conceal the erudite author behind them.</p>
<p>The speaker in “Black Step,” whose native idiom is the rural makeshift of the cunning but lightly lettered, vanishes when he says, “it still has a glow to it, a veteran allure,” and the grinning author shows through. Woodrell is walking on the same thin ice as any author who writes in dialect, always calculating how much to bend the notes, find the sweet space between Natty Bumpo’s parlor speech and the coarse tanglefoot Sut Lovingood spews. But even Twain misjudges at times, so Woodrell’s in decent company.</p>
<p>In this gathering of a dozen examples of dirty realism, Woodrell tries his hand at riff, sketch, rant, dark aria, many of them delivered by what we’re trained to call “unreliable narrators,” which is more a question of degree than kind. Fabrication, exaggeration, understatement and non sequitur – all are part of the arsenal of the afflicted and wicked whose tales are reminiscent of the yarns and anecdotes we usually get by ear rather than eye, and this is the going mode in Southern fiction, especially when written by men.<br />Some are better at this canny rawness than Woodrell, others not so good. The images in this album that leave me unpersuaded do so often because the dramatis personae are all cut from the same bolt, all deep in malfeasance, with no moral scale implied. An archeologist will often place a nickel or a pen knife beside an artifact to give the viewer a sense of scale, and Woodrell isn’t always thus inclined.</p>
<p>All this grousing aside, Woodrell at his best in the short form is dazzling, and the fifteen pages of “Night Stand” are worthy of William Gay, which is high praise in my book. The story opens with the poignantly-named Pelham, a Viet Nam vet, waking in the middle of the night to find a menacing, growling naked man standing over the bed where he and his wife have been sleeping. When he reaches to the night stand in search of the lamp, he finds a plate with a knife on it and proceeds, he believes, to defend home and hearth. His defense is frenzied and lethal in a scene that will make many wince, but the story is about the unsolvable mystery of the young Iraq veteran’s intrusion, the responses of Pelham’s neighbors and the soldier’s father and, primarily, the protagonist’s tormented attempt to shed his sense of guilt. During the relentless self-interrogation, he admits that many men have fantasies “about a moment like this, an opportunity for sanctified violence, a time to open the cage” and free the primitive beast. Realization of the fantasy, however, is anything but fulfilling, and Pelham, the survivor of one nightmarish jungle fire fight during his brief deployment, keeps excavating his past and his nature in search of an answer which doesn’t exist. It leaves him instead scouring his house by day, patrolling it by night. Without sentimentality or false resolution Woodrell brings Pelham and his wife into sharp focus and implicitly makes a convincing case that the process of grief and the aftereffects of shock do not fall into neat stages but all swirl and ghost together in a deadly syndrome that has to be survived.</p>
<p><em>The Outlaw Album</em> may be read quickly but resists that treatment, as Woodrell can be deft and nuanced beneath the tours de force of manic/lyric dramatic monologue. His characters remind us of one of Hemingway’s great sentences: &#8220;The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong in the broken places.&#8221; In their attempts to be strong, Woodrell&#8217;s characters arrest us, and many will not be easy to forget.</p>
