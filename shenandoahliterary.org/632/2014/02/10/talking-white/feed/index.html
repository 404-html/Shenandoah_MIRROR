					<description><![CDATA[This piece is so powerful. I agree that schools should focus on the value and complexity of many different languages, rather than sticking to a canon that privileges mainly white, male, and Western writers. I also think that there is sometimes more room for diversity of language, dialect, etc. in poetry than there is in prose, and I hope that will change with time. No writer should ever feel discouraged by language &quot;rules&quot; when the content and what moves others is all that really matters, at least to me.]]></description>
