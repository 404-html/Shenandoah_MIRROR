					<description><![CDATA[What a masterful piece.  There&#039;s such distinctly different characterization between Henry and Beth - Henry blunt and strong and willing to risk, Beth more held back, cautious - and so much of it captured and conveyed in the details, the little things (Henry needing Beth to stop her from biting her own cheek, it was Henry who suggested the ice boat). I love that this story starts with (or starts immediately after) Beth doing what Beth would rarely do: taking a risk. But she tried the safe path with Leonard, and what did they get her? And so here, we see her changing - risking so much by telling Henry, risking as the Jeep slid across the ice. &quot;The littleness of what she wanted could make her bones ache if she let it&quot; - this line is so right and true and perfect.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Women relate in such a complicated universe of contradiction, expectation, jealousy, and tacit understanding. Beth and Henry are authentic, recognizable. You caught the intrinsic truth that age does not alter our self-image and self-doubts, that women in their sixties still feeling the hurt and insecurity of adolescence--still fantasize about romantic possibilities, still compete, even with their best friend.The difference is that they recognize and regret the incongruity of feelings that they suspect belong by right to the young. I learned a lot about a way of life with which I am totally unfamiliar. I found myself rereading passages to more explicitly comprehend the mechanics of ice- fishing, the role of the ice house, the sliding spree in Sir Wildgin. I liked being challenged that way. I loved the independence, skills, and strength of these women who defy literary stereotypes and who are so much more real. Thanks for a great, engaging read!]]></description>
