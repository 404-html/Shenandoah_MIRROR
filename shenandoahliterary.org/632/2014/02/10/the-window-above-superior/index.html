						<p>An outdoor bench in the hospital gardens,<br />
the terrace bordered by waist-high,<br />
vase-shaped bushes. Because it was Sunday,<br />
the streets were empty and sounds not audible<br />
for the rest of the week were audible now.<br />
The opening and closing of a door. The voice<br />
of a man scolding his child. A moped stopping<br />
at the curb. Bird sounds, and not just city pigeons,<br />
but finches, chickadees, starlings, jays.<br />
The gardens weren’t too crowded, the sunlight<br />
wasn’t too bright, the air was neither too hot<br />
nor too cold. Though I observed them very carefully,<br />
the expressions on the faces of the people nearby<br />
were careful not to give anything away.<br />
To my left, the branch of a shade tree hollowed<br />
by insects still bore a few leaves, and where<br />
the forked trunk split, a plastic grocery bag<br />
was lodged like the nest of an animal or bird.<br />
And so the hour passed, each moment saved<br />
from a morning wasted in useless self-reflection,<br />
and by the time I went back indoors, anything<br />
seemed possible, happiness as well, as long<br />
as my mind kept pace with whatever<br />
new perceptions came my way.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>As if I were a newcomer to my own emotions,<br />
the first thing she asked me was “How do you feel?”<br />
I did my best to give her a thoughtful answer,<br />
but when I saw that she didn’t even note it<br />
on her legal pad, I began to revise, augment,<br />
elaborate on what I’d said. This went on until<br />
I was no longer sure what I was trying to say,<br />
as if my words had only confused my thoughts,<br />
and I felt the urge to ask if I could start over again.<br />
Perhaps to verify my impressions, she took up<br />
the narrative and played it back more or less<br />
in my own words, choosing this image,<br />
not that, this phrase, not that, carrying on<br />
until she reached the moment where I’d left off.<br />
But why stop there? Since we already shared<br />
a point of view, why not push on to the conclusion?</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>On the wall behind her, a hand-textured<br />
canvas print of Tuscan tiles, the brushstrokes<br />
varying from one square to the next, first left to right,<br />
then top to bottom, then left to right again.<br />
Though I expected it to be filled with tissues,<br />
the trashcan was empty, as was the acid green<br />
Lucite vase on the table. It seemed that<br />
wherever I rested my eyes I was reminded<br />
that I was talking to a stranger, and in so doing<br />
that I was learning all over what it means to exist.<br />
Pleased with the progress I was making,<br />
at session’s end she warmly extended her hand<br />
and I, in turn, received it (slavishly) in both of mine.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Waking early, as I often did, it took little effort<br />
to create the effect that something was in store for me,<br />
and whatever that was would come as a surprise.<br />
Likewise, nothing seemed more natural than<br />
the thought that I was led by rather than leading<br />
my life, the truth of experience always only about<br />
to be mine. Though the effect was brief, the memory<br />
of it lingered, and from time to time throughout<br />
the day it came over me, the sense that I was<br />
traveling “lifeward,” becoming myself all over again.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Eye-level in the overheated waiting room,<br />
a fireplace fire played in a loop on the television screen.<br />
It was difficult to tell where the loop began,<br />
though the logs continued to burn and the flames<br />
continued to rise. As if testing the heat of the fire,<br />
a child reached out then quickly withdrew his hand.<br />
Somewhere behind me a cell phone rang;<br />
in front of me, an old man in overalls<br />
tapped his leg with a magazine while his wife,<br />
tiny and archaic, sucked the inside of her cheeks.<br />
Out of consideration, no one looked at anyone<br />
directly, but at everyone from the corner<br />
of an eye. From time to time a man in white<br />
arrived to survey the room. He understood<br />
all of us, and all of us had something to be understood.<br />
From a distance it might’ve appeared<br />
that we were there because we had nothing better<br />
to do, and nowhere better to do it, that nothing<br />
mattered less than the world beyond the world inside</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Having signed out early in the afternoon,<br />
I bought apples at the farmer’s market, a wedge<br />
of pie at the bakery, a newspaper at a stand.<br />
On my way to catch the crosstown bus,<br />
I stopped to watch as one by one a tower crane<br />
raised a rusted (or rust-colored) I-beam<br />
from a flatbed up twenty-some stories to the roof<br />
of the City Services Wing. The framing in<br />
of the final floor provided occasion for a topping-off<br />
party in the courtyard of the art museum,<br />
a slate space where, each at a different angle,<br />
a number of canvas bannered tents were anchored<br />
to bags of sand. I sat down on the ledge<br />
of a raised concrete flowerbed planted with rows<br />
of Chicago Brick wrapped in woolen sweater scraps<br />
and sprinkled with mustard seeds. In a few small<br />
patches of light, some of the seeds had started<br />
to sprout, and now and then a woman I took to be<br />
the artist appeared with a watering can. Because,<br />
I assumed, the project required the theoretical<br />
silence of nature, my polite inquiries were met<br />
with an unresponsive stare.  Sympathetic as I am<br />
to the aesthetics of silence, to the childlike fantasy<br />
of escaping the material world of words, the cursive<br />
spray of her watering can and the fluent undulations<br />
that darkened the bricks gave rise to such intensity<br />
of feeling that even hours later, long after I’d stood<br />
and applauded the tedious speeches, I still bore<br />
the impression, the senseless, unshakeable impression,<br />
that I’d been made the butt of an elaborate joke.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>I once read in a book, which I now recall<br />
only in the vaguest terms, that we know the world<br />
not through our sensory perceptions—which are,<br />
at best, unreliable—but through our thoughts<br />
about those perceptions. At the time, the idea<br />
struck me with the force of revelation, for it seemed<br />
that in the delay between sense and reflection<br />
another unarticulated life, another stream<br />
of consciousness, continued on within me.<br />
And I remember thinking: “That’s just how it is!”<br />
On the other hand, there were days of inertia<br />
when the idea struck me as absurd, when thought<br />
seemed little more than a curtain between<br />
myself and the world. And on those days<br />
I made a point of limiting those dealings<br />
necessity requires to the barest possible details:<br />
“My social security number is…” “I need an MR 16<br />
halogen bulb.” “Go three blocks south, turn left<br />
on Lasalle, and you’ll find it next to a comic book store.”<br />
Clearly I hoped to achieve something.<br />
At the very least, to make better use of my time;<br />
at most, to keep my secrets to myself. To earn<br />
the right to observe the world without taking part,<br />
that was the dream: the bystander standing<br />
beside the fact, the fact standing on its own.<br />
A not entirely human dream but one,<br />
nonetheless, in which I was able to lose myself<br />
in the busyness of keeping myself alive.</p>
