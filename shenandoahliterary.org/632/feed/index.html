								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/632/files/2014/03/Flann.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-557" alt="Flann" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/632/files/2014/03/Flann.jpg" width="163" height="217" /></a>Flannery O’Connor’s personal prayer journal surprises with her passion and innocence toward faith, reminding the reader of the perspective of a young woman not fully evolved into the Southern Gothic writer that she is known as today. A kind stroke of luck introduced me to <em>A Prayer Journal</em> a few weeks ago when a friend lent me a copy; I had not yet heard about its publication at the time. I was initially surprised to experience such an immediate involvement with the text. A large part of the reason the journal captivates the reader’s attention comes from O’Connor’s honest display of her humanity. The unedited text allows the reader to see her original thoughts while writing, rather than the final product of many edits made ready for publication. The journal contains lines such as, “But I do not mean to be clever although I do mean to be clever on 2nd thought and like to be clever &amp; want to be considered so” (6), where the reader is given clear glimpses of O’Connor’s unique personality.</p>
<p>It is O’Connor’s personality that makes it possible to connect with the text, as the reader can easily internalize the words O’ Connor writes. The young Mary Flannery, only 20  at the time of the first entry, tugs at the reader’s emotions with candid lines such as, “Please help me dear God to be a good writer, and to get something else accepted” (10). Although O’Connor’s language is occasionally colloquial, she satisfies the literary readers by filling the text with vivid metaphors and unique allusions. In the first entry she exclaims, “You are the slim crescent of a moon that I see and my self is the earth’s shadow that keeps me from seeing all the moon”(3). Throughout the journal, the personal nature of the text does not detract at all from the quality and originality of O’Connor’s writing.</p>
<p>O’Connor’s youthful strictness in her faith occasionally provides some comedic aspects to the journal, but more importantly, demonstrates a measure of absolute dedication to her relationship with God that may be unknown to a casual reader of O’Connor. In the short few sentences of the journal’s last entry O’Connor writes, “Today I have proved myself a glutton – for Scotch oatmeal cookies and erotic thought. There is nothing left to say of me”(40). The seriousness in which she takes her Catholic faith lends a fresh perspective to the instances of religion in her other works, especially due to the fact that this journal was written before all of her major works. Certain parts of the journal provide such an intimate perspective of O’Connor that the reader often feels a small sense of guilt for intruding, as if the reader had stolen the diary like a mischievous younger brother.  O’Connor’s journal is quite short, containing only 38 pages with 24 entries, most of which do not take up a whole page. However, the combination of contrasting entries provides the reader with an intimate perspective on a young woman named Mary O’Connor, and on a time long before she wrote anything that was deemed ‘grotesque,&#8217; or should I say, ‘realistic.&#8217;  The author’s innocent and thoughtful youth delivers a refreshing and unexpected addition to Flannery O’Connor’s oeuvre.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I began skimming<em> Southern Sin</em> with the suspicion that I wouldn’t enjoy it.  The subtitle, <a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/632/files/2014/03/sin.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-533" alt="sin" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/632/files/2014/03/sin.jpg" width="135" height="204" /></a>“True Stories of the Sultry South &amp; Women Behaving Badly,” suggested a compendium of wanna-be-naughty memoirs of the predictable and superficial sort.  After all, “south” and “sultry” and “sin” – the buzz words of titillation, unreal “real housewives,” various shades of Confederate gray.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say that every essay in the book rises above formula and selfie impishness, but a number of the pieces turn out to be surprising in detail, stylish, self-interrogating, memorable.  Some rise above the protocols of confession to become examples of witness.  More useful than the subtitle in forecasting the volume&#8217;s tone and urgency is Dorothy Allison’s zesty introduction with its recommendation that we consider the famous seven deadlies as we engage with the collection, though lust dominates.</p>
<p>I always enjoy stories with a discernible “local habitation and a name,” but I’ll admit that my attention sharpened when I began to recognize in Sarah Gilbert’s “No Other Gods” the landmarks of my own community.  What really kept me going, however, was her revelation (maybe autopsy) of a certain recognizable class, a certain lifestyle, exposure without malice.  The writing is irreverent without predictable attitude, self-empowering without exaggerating the foibles of those around her, and Gilbert’s rhetorical strategies render her testimony almost incantatory.</p>
<p>One thing absent from the book but which I didn’t miss is the list of usual suspects – Rosemary Daniell, Ellen Gilchrist – the celebrity transgressor-belles whose tales have become a little too familiar.  And here I should confess that one of the new voices I really enjoyed was not new to me.  Full disclosure – Elyse Moody was one of my <em>Shenandoah</em> interns a few years ago, but her writing has deepened and sharpened in the intervening time.  I suspect her contribution “Trouble” is part of a larger work, an investigation into the foggy territory of family rumor and loose ends, and she succeeds, without resorting to spectacle, in making me want to know what makes this clan work; the case of self-defense under examination allows the author to explore place and custom and the process of her own practical education.  And where else were you going to find out that Rome, Georgia owns a bronze replica of the Capitoline Wolf, given to the Georgia town by Mussolini himself?  Nor will those hoping for a gothic detail or two be disappointed.  If it looks like I&#8217;m playing favorites, at least I&#8217;m not sneaking.</p>
<p>Elane Johnson&#8217;s &#8220;Porn Star&#8221; is amusing and surprising, not nearly so salty as the title suggests.  In fact, these &#8220;souvenirs&#8221; in language tend to be direct without being graphic, tasteful without being prissy.  The most off-key selection, to my ear, was the one piece by a male, Aaron Gwyn&#8217;s &#8220;Love in the Worst Way.&#8221;  Gwyn is a skillful writer who often writes sex with a directness that suits some but not all contexts.  His story felt like a misfit in this gathering, given its general weather.  But I have to say that a woman does behave badly in his essay, or perhaps like Jessica Rabbitt she&#8217;s just drawn bad.  Suzanne Roberts&#8217;s essay, also nervy, rang a little tinny, carried some of that expected exhibitionistic TMI, but now I begin to feel a little prudish myself.</p>
<p>Two additional features of note are journalistic in tenor and immediately arresting.  &#8220;Mad Love: The Ballad of Fred and Allie&#8221; by Sonja Livingston tells of &#8220;illicit&#8221; love, attempted elopement, disappointment, despair, crime and punishment in Memphis before Handy had set the blues to music.  The abbreviated nature of the piece contributes to its lyrical pitch and pathos.  Louella Bryant&#8217;s &#8220;Rum-Running Queen&#8221; whetted my appetite and left me wanting more about moonshining, hoodwinking, supercharging and &#8220;a white tailored dress with brown ruffled sleeves,&#8221; all relevant to notorious Willie Carter Sharpe of Franklin County and her daredevil, profitable avocation.  For those who want a familiar touchstone, think of the recent film &#8220;Lawless.&#8221;</p>
<p>Intensity and surprise twists, confession, regret, relief and triumph.  After all, it&#8217;s all about the garter belt and the Bible belt, holding out and giving in and all the attendant joys, confusion and anguish.  I don&#8217;t know how gendered my reading is, but Gutkind and Fennelly offer up a couple of dozen stories, few clumsy, not many irritating, a full dozen of them re-readable.  Text on the back of the book claims these are &#8220;stories of women flirting with perdition,&#8221; which is no small matter for either gender, but flirtation is the minor chord in this anthology.  It&#8217;s worth reading for the major ones, the pain and the heaving laughter, that whole famous Faulkner list involving the human heart.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/632/files/2014/03/shadow_of_wind.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-515 alignright" alt="shadow_of_wind" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/632/files/2014/03/shadow_of_wind.jpeg" width="128" height="196" /></a>The streets of post-war Barcelona are veiled in <em>The Shadow of the Wind</em>, and something lurks in the darkness. This is the truth that Daniel Sempere learns as he endeavors to uncover the secrets of the eponymously named book he found as a child in a secret library. The book, written by one Julián Carax, may be the last surviving piece of the author’s work; someone has committed himself to destroying every copy printed under Carax’s name. Carlos Ruiz Zafón guides his reader through the gothic and enchanting Barcelona cityscape via Daniel’s investigations. Among descriptions that paint the old beauty of the setting, the author also creates a sinister air which suggests danger under every cobblestone. This duality is complemented by dense characters that are seldom as they seem. Zafón’s physical descriptions and careful dialogue disclose deceptions to the perceptive reader. Just as the image of a cigarette alight in the dark pulls the reader into the shadows, so too does each dismissive word or nervous glance ask the reader to inquire further after the characters’ pasts.</p>
<p>Zafón pays homage to older Romantic and Gothic writers with his elegant prose ripe with skillful metaphor. Readers afraid of bristling with envy at the imagery should leave this book alone. Readers ready with a stack of notes to mark memorable quotations, however, should uncap their highlighters – there’s no shortage. Similarly poetic is the description of the characters and their dialogue. This results in vivid exchanges that remind the reader of watching a film. At times, this results in some excessively dramatic exchanges. Despite the allure of the writing, it’s still evident that real people don’t talk or act like these characters sometimes do. Granted, many of the characters are well-read and eloquent, but the author sacrifices more believable dialogue in favor of profound and quotable quips. Zafón at times strays into an overabundance of stylistic writing – the same thing that captures you might lose you too.</p>
<p><em>The Shadow of the Wind</em> will not be filed away under great literature. Sometimes it feels overwrought, though this may be partially the fault of the translator. It won’t instigate tremendous introspection. It will leave you caring about the characters and enchanted with its gothic Barcelona. It will leave you thinking about it in between readings and days after your finish. If you want beautiful writing and a story to invest yourself in, this book will deliver those expectations. You’ll sprint through this book just as quickly as I did.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Native Ground</strong></p>
<p>For the past twenty or so years, I have made a career as a teacher of American literature.  For nearly fifteen, I have worked also, with equal seriousness and passion, as a photographer.</p>
<p>My series <strong>Native Ground</strong> unites these pursuits in an exploration of the role place plays in shaping the literary imagination: the notion that writers compose out of a peculiar understanding and depth of connection to physical space, remembered or immediate.  Personal and professional interests have led me to focus on writers who have lived and worked in the Southern region of the United States.</p>
<p>Using a primitive hand-held film camera, for this series I am making images that depict points of origin—meditating on personal spaces and landscapes in light of my familiarity with and curiosity about selected writers’ works and biographies.   They are particularly intimate photographs that propose narratives of connection in the development of vision and voice.</p>
<p>Robert Adams, a great contemporary photographer of the American West who was originally an English professor, says in his book <em>Why People Photograph</em>:</p>
<p><em>At our best and most fortunate we make pictures because of what stands in front of the camera, to honor what is greater and more interesting than we are.  We never accomplish this perfectly, though in return we are given something perfect—a sense of inclusion.  Our subject thus redefines us, and is part of the biography by which we want to be known.</em> (179)</p>
<p>Perhaps this explains my fascination with this subject—these places I visit and stitch with threads of my imagination to works I love, which have spoken to me, and which over time have surely shaped my own identity.  For me, the photographs are another form of sense-making.</p>
<p>In this regard, the photographs in <strong>Native Ground</strong> are a kind of supreme fiction: my imagination of how physical spaces, lives lived, and art converge.</p>

Though each story stands independently, most published in newspapers and magazines by themselves over the course of a few years, together the individual vignettes combine to form a whole. Common themes weave through the sections to form a montage of the self-contemplation of time—the past self, the present self, and the future self. Eagen introduces a quirky yet relatable cast of music world misfits on journeys of self-discovery.</p>
<p>Each story presents the characters at different times in their lives, from adolescence to adulthood to the not-so-distant future. Eagen introduces Bennie Salazaar as a music producer at Sow Ear Records in New York City. We meet Sasha, Bennie’s assistant with the uncontrollable compulsion to steal. Later we journey with Sasha through Naples and the Italian coast. We observe Bennie as a teenager, who along with Alice, Jocelyn, Scotty, form a 1979 punk-rock band striving for fame in rundown, San Franciscan garages. Eagen introduces Lou Kline, an eccentric music producer who overindulges in drugs and women, recognizes Bennie’s young talent, and makes Bennie his protégé. Eagen reacquaints us with Scotty in his adulthood when he coins the phrase “Time’s a goon” while he contemplates his unaccomplished life, wondering how he digresses as a person over time. Jocelyn reaches adulthood and panics:</p>
<p>We stand there, quiet. My questions all seem wrong: How did you get so old? Was          it all at once, in a day, or did you peter out bit by bit? When did you stop having parties? Did everyone else get old too, or was it just you? Are other people still here, hiding in the palm trees or holding their breath underwater? When did you last swim your laps? Do your bones hurt? Did you know this was coming and hide that you knew, or did it ambush you from behind?</p>
<p>What does time do to the individual?</p>
<p>Eagen creates sharp, distinct stories with strong characters who captivate the reader and carry the plot from one section to the next. The author displays her phenomenal style through unique diction and phrases. Each character possesses a distinct identity and backstory, providing a wide spectrum of readers to find a character to empathize with. Eagen fills the book with outside information that relates to the time period, like popular songs from each era, to validate the book’s reality. She presents her innovative flair by including a section by Sasha’s daughter, a slide show entitled “Great Rock and Roll Pauses—By Allison Blake” with diagrams and flow charts that depict the Blake family in seventy-four pages. Eagen’s style includes a playful tone supplemented with dark imagery to connect with characters’ emotions throughout time.</p>
<p>This coming of age story grasps the reader’s attention, offering an opportunity for him or her to identify with the different characters throughout their various stages of life. The music world misfits lose friends in one era and attempt to reestablish the broken bonds in another. But it is the music industry that ties the characters together, and in the end, it is the power of music that reconnects the characters not only to each other but also to their individual selves. The characters are living in the past; they dwell on former habits and mindsets, and hope for a better future that will continue to be far away as long as they remain in the past. Each character attempts to find themselves as individuals and to find their place in society.</p>

Originally created as a radio story, the first installation was compiled and printed in 1979 as a novel. Adams’ story follows the adventure of Arthur Dent an exceedingly average Englishman, and his friend and Ford Prefect, (revealed to be a stranded alien just prior to the destruction of Earth) who escape the ruin of Earth by hitching a ride on the spaceships that blew it up. Arthur and Ford proceed to take a seemingly random ride through space, meeting the president of the galaxy, finding out the meaning of everything, and running into Arthur’s ex-girlfriend. In the course of their adventure, Arthur learns to appreciate the wonderful disconnection of a universe driven primarily by greed and personal advancement, often portrayed through caricatures of human personalities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While many authors would shy away from such obviously extreme plot devices, Adams layers them in as heavily as possible. In a stark exclamation of style, he produces irreverent humor from the utter improbability and chaos he creates. Similarly, not many authors could pull off something as bold as blowing up the Earth in the introductory chapters and still make it both hilarious and agreeable to the reader. Adams’ direct, almost deadpan comedy highlights his message about the general silliness of society, even intergalactic ones. He couches his commentary comfortably in metaphors that point out the hilarity of disproportion humanity faces, such as “‘Space,’ it says, ‘is big. Really big. You just won&#8217;t believe how vastly hugely mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean you may think it&#8217;s a long way down the road to the chemist, but that&#8217;s just peanuts to space’”. In every aspect of this work Adams strives to invoke biting satire about the human condition, the enormity of the galaxy (both in terms of size and seriousness) outside of mankind, and, especially, politics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several supporting characters, such as Zaphod Beeblebrox, the incompetent (and valued for being so) celebrity president of the galaxy, and Marvin the depressed existential android contribute to the cast, creating a mélange of character development and criticism. On the surface this novel appears to be nothing more than a slightly nonsensical comedy, but if read carefully, Adams’ wit evolves into something broader. This work is slightly older, but the themes are just as fitting today as they ever have been. <i>Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy </i>should be read at least twice, once for the inherent beauty of Adams’ comedy, and again for his subtle and scathing opinions on the contrivances of “modern” life once the reader is in on the joke.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/632/files/2014/03/bastard.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-555" alt="bastard" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/632/files/2014/03/bastard.jpg" width="168" height="254" /></a>If the colloquial voice in Harper Lee’s <i>To Kill a Mockingbird </i>still echoes relentlessly in your head, I think I have a book to satisfy your needs. Dorothy Allison’s <i>Bastard Out of Carolina</i> struck me immediately with its strong narrative voice and undeniable sense of place. It went on to challenge me with some difficult themes, like abuse and the interlocking system of oppression that is poverty. On multiple levels, I was affected by the book more than I expected, and I pined for it within moments of finishing the last page.</p>
<p>Ruth Anne Boatwright, affectionately known as “Bone,” has struggled with her name throughout her life. In South Carolina during the 1950’s, being born to unmarried parents results in being stamped with the ultimate dis: bastard. Her only secure sense of identity comes from her tender relationship with her mother and her mother’s siblings: Aunt Ruth, Aunt Alma, and Uncle Earle, just to name a few. Her Aunt Ruth denounces the title, “bastard child,” insisting “an’t no stamp on her nobody can see” (Allison 3) When Bone is just a toddler, her mother, Anney, marries a loving man named Lyle Persons. It seems like Anney may have found relief from her lifelong poverty, if not from financial burdens, from the shame of being a single mother. Lyle dies tragically in an accident, leaving Anney on her own, broken hearted and aged beyond her years. It seems like it couldn’t get much worse, but in walks Daddy Glen.</p>
<p>Anney’s marriage to Daddy Glen creates a slew of problems for Bone. He abuses her from an early age. He provokes her to act out against him so that he might continue to have an “excuse” to abuse her. His stuck-up family treats Bone and her sister Reese like animals, forcing them to eat outside at family gatherings because they “might track dirt in the house.” Yet there are enough peaceful moments to soften the edges and make this book worth reading. Bone cherishes evenings spent on Granny’s porch listening to stories and drinking sweet tea. Anney’s 2 am breakfast is an oasis in the midst of Bone and Reese’s hunger, featuring homemade biscuits with jelly, fried tomatoes, and eggs that “melt like butter between your teeth and your tongue” (Allison 77-78). While the book is certainly challenging thematically, it reads like a good story would be told, rich with details like “Kool-Aid and cookies after Sunday school” (174). A story of family, classism, and identity, this book is much more than something to read. It is an experience, a way of feeling unfamiliar emotions and understanding characters on a human level. If you’re ready to be transported to that “caught up in a book” state, look no further than <i>Bastard Out of Carolina.</i></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignright" alt="s9780099458289" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/s9780099458289-194x300.jpg" width="128" height="198" />Are they delusional or just sympathetic? The characters in Sebastian Faulks’ novel <i>A Week in December</i> appear to be both. The narrative encompasses a number of alternative realities, from the online Parallax universe of Jenni Fortuneto the marijuana-fueled haze of Finn Veals’s teenage world. Each of these secondary worlds exists outside of the ‘real world’ of present-day London, but all demonstrate an attempt to escape the more alarming and disturbing reality of modern society. The most successful, and perhaps most realistic, of these alternative realities is the Fantasy Finance world of John Veals. The greedy financier ignores the needs of his family and the harmful effects of his financial policies on the community as a whole. He flaunts his mathematical prowess in order to demonstrate his intellectual dominance and appears disinterested even in the money he makes. In short, Veals is a selfish ass. He’s also the central character within the novel. Marked by a skewed moral compass and a complete lack of empathy, the money manager monopolizes the pages of the novel as author Faulks illustrates the workings of his backwards mind.</p>
<p>Potentially problematic to the success of any novel is a major character without any redeeming characteristics. A narrative such as <i>A Week in December</i>, which lacks a central protagonist, especially risks losing readership by continuously returning to an off-putting personality like Veals. Where’s the happy ending? Where are the consequences for his greed and insensitivity? Veals’s son Finbar appears as the most direct recipient of this falsified family structure. Finn, armed with more cash than he knows what to do with and no parental guidance, overdoses on a dangerous drug compound. Yet even the near-death experience of his son fails to motivate the elder Veals to change his ways. Without spoiling the plot, the novel ends with Veals alone and content in his self-indulgence, sans remorse or retribution.</p>
<p>How could I enjoy such a novel? This is where the genius of author Sebastian Faulks emerges. The secondary reality Faulks builds for Veals appears closer to actual reality than is initially evident—Veals may be a despicable character, but he closely mirrors Wall Street tycoons during the early 2000s. The novel becomes a relevant treatise on modern social strata. Examples of other alternate realities include the online gaming system that mimics modern-day London and the competitive literati world inhabited by failed novelist R. Tranter. Each of these secondary worlds makes the novel relatable to its readers rather than putting a neat bow on modern dynamics of culture. The result is a narrative that both allows for a sense of escapism from the ‘real world’ and realistically reminds readers of its relevancy in contemporary society.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Linda Hogan’s novel <i>Solar Storms</i> is a beautifully written window into the life of an American Indian teenager and the family that she is inextricably bound to. Drawing on her own experiences from growing up a Chickasaw Indian, Hogan is able to paint a realistic and deeply touching first person narrative that not only tells her protagonist Angela’s story, but also gives overwhelmingly tangible descriptions of life as an American Indian.</p>
<p>Angela, a seventeen-year-old American Indian girl, tells her story of searching for her birth mother. After searching court records, she finds a woman whom she believes to be her great grandmother and who, by some crazy fate, is still alive. After getting in touch with this woman, Angela begins her journey to find her mother. At many points in her quest, Angela stops to reflect on her surroundings. At times, she describes her great-grandmother Agnes, who is now traveling with her, wears a blue-gray tattered fur coat and carries two plastic grocery bags, one in each hand, of all of their belongings.</p>
<p>The true strength in Hogan’s writing is her ability to tap into the honest American Indian way of relating all things back to the earth that created them. Even Agnes and Angela see themselves as a part of a whole, and also as people who will one day return to the earth that they came from. Hogan constantly notes the smells of the earth and the texture of the nature that surrounds them—Angela smells the musky smell of autumn and notices winters without wolves. There is a heightened level of perception that Hogan not only writes, but lends to her readers as well.</p>
<p>Though there have been many successful American Indian authors, and even female American Indian authors such as Louise Erdrich and Joy Harjo, Hogan finds her own niche within this already unique group by fully embodying her teenage character.  She seamlessly weaves her story into those of her mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother, all the while constructing a setting so real that readers may feel like they are watching the story unfold.</p>

<p>“There’s no <i>one</i> thing that’s true.  It’s all true.” – Ernest Hemingway.  So reads the epigraph at the beginning of Paula McLain’s novel <i>The Paris Wife</i>.  A carefully researched book, <i>The Paris Wife</i> offers readers a new side of Hemingway’s “truth” (or should I say an alternate fiction) – an intimate story based on the courtship and marriage of Ernest Hemingway and his first wife, Hadley Richardson, from her point of view.  Despite some moments of cliché and frustration, <i>The Paris Wife</i> is a raw, refreshing take on one of the literary world’s most fabled romances.</p>
<p>In Hemingway’s novels, Hadley remains relatively voiceless.  She is an object of love and admiration; less of a fully developed human than a tool off of which Hemingway bounces self-consumed emotions and musings.  McLain allows Hadley to flourish as a character, and even more as a narrator, providing a thought provoking look at the world that, traditionally Hemingway’s, becomes Hadley’s.</p>
<p>From the very beginning, Hadley is an endearing and engaging woman.  McLain makes her adorably uncool (she was, as Janet Maslin wrote in her review of <i>The Paris Wife</i> for <i>The New York Times</i>, “admittedly unfashionable”).  The book begins:  “It’s October 1920 and jazz is everywhere.  I don’t know any jazz, so I’m playing Rachmaninoff.”  While Hemingway was often the (flawed) hero of his writing and took on a ruggedly heroic persona in his own life, Hadley is the undeniable heroine of <i>The Paris Wife</i>.  She is a different kind of heroine:  eloquent and understated, womanly in a strong, sturdy way, loving, loyal, and steadfast (though at times to the point of frustration).</p>
<p>The reader watches the events depicted in classic Hemingway works such as <i>A Moveable Feast</i> and <i>The Sun Also Rises</i> unfold from Hadley’s point of view.  We are privy to her opinions of the famous characters who surrounded the Hemingways:  Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, F. Scott Fitzgerald.  We look on helplessly as Hemingway falls in love with Pauline Pfieffer before our (and Hadley’s) eyes and as Ernest and Hadley’s marriage falls into dysfunction and decay.</p>
<p>I want to say that I fell in and out of love with Ernest as Hadley does, but that was just not the case.  McLain’s Hadley acknowledges Hem’s unique genius and his good, despite his self-absorption, infidelity, and immaturity for much longer than I could.   Perhaps the most striking example of this was McLain’s depiction of Hadley reading “Tatie’s” (her nickname for Hemingway) draft of <i>The Sun Also Rises</i>:  “when he gave me the pages to read, it took me no time at all to realize that everything was just as it had happened in Spain . . . It was all nearly verbatim, except for one thing – I wasn’t in it all.”  And yet, Hadley remains calm and unbelievably reasonable:  &#8220;&#8216;I could see how remarkable the work was, more exciting and alive than anything he’d ever written&#8217; . . . &#8216;Is it any good?&#8217;  Ernest said when I’d finally finished.  &#8216;I have to know.&#8217;  &#8216;It’s more than good, Tatie.  There’s nothing like it anywhere.&#8217;”</p>
<p>I have to admit that moments like this were a bit frustrating.  I felt sorry for Hadley and admired her poise and composure, but I wanted desperately for her to ditch Hem before he turned Pauline into his live-in girlfriend (or at least be a little more angry about it).  However, McLain does have Hadley eventually address that frustration, allowing the reader access to her anger and hurt:  “I wanted to scream.  I didn’t scream, and that became one of the things I grew to regret.”</p>
<p>Although this novel is a fictionalization of Hem and Hadley’s relationship, it is heavily based on true events, and McLain conducted intensive research prior to its writing.  She read letters of, as she referred to it, their “delicious correspondence,” and Hadley’s speech for the book was modeled on her language patterns in those letters.  Much of the time, McLain’s bare, straightforward writing style (and Hadley’s speech) mimics Hemingway’s signature barebones melodrama:  “how sad and strange we all are,” Hadley at one point laments.  Although this writing style is classic and beautiful, the book at times feels like a parody of Hem’s style.  This is especially noticeable in the few italicized chapters from his point of view:</p>
<p>“<i>The rich had better days and freer nights.  They brought the sun with them and made the tides move.  Pauline was a new model of woman and why couldn’t he have her?  Why couldn’t he reach out and claim everything he wanted?</i>”</p>
<p>“Who the hell does this guy think he is?” McLain, Hadley, and I seemed to be asking together.  It felt good to question him.</p>

The collection contains four sections, each capturing some facet from the speaker’s childhood, abusive marriage, and struggle to find happiness in a world haunted by her “figment,” Lilianna. Lilianna’s presence makes itself known from the very beginning, with the collection’s first chilling poem “The Figment.” The figment, Lilianna, is described as one who “vanishes” and returns in many forms—“just as God does.” In this poem and throughout the collection, Lilianna serves as a spirit like manifestation of the speaker’s intense grief; she floats, a broken off piece of what used to be a whole woman, one to whom the speaker can tell about “sadness,” while she thinks about “one way of living: slipping off / into some indistinguishable state / of more and more snow.”</p>
<p>With this introduction, Seay provides the template for the rest of the collection: a journey through the cold, seemingly endless world in which the lines between past and present, reality and imagination, and right and wrong are crossed and blurred. In <i>To See the Queen</i>, Seay’s striking line breaks and calm, salient images to make each poem resonate, gong-like. And Lilianna hovers in the sound waves. While each poem differs in content, Seay deftly weaves motifs of space, elements, and love, all the while questioning what it truly means to “see.”</p>
<p>In a later poem, “Room of the Curved Spines,” the speaker speculates on the dangerous nature of bad habits and bad influence as she recalls a moment in a middle-school bathroom, where “the girls / stood in line as a string of beads / and one by one we removed our blouses&#8230;vertebra by vertebra we were inspected like pearls.” The poem offers a sinister picture of anorexia contrasted with the youthful perception of beauty like “pearls,” noting, “Before long, things become permanent.”</p>
<p>The collection has the unique effect of capturing a myriad of compelling moments and cataloguing them into one book that seems to relay not just a narrative, but also a journey. Seay’s deeply personal voice sings a sad yet wrenchingly powerful song from poem to poem, and you cannot help but nod along empathetically as you turn each careful page. Seay draws you into her town (another compelling metaphor throughout the collection), and you find yourself sinking with her, chilled when she is chilled, questioning the abusive nature of God and man and then finding solace in an ultimate recovery—all the while, feeling Lilianna’s silent presence in the background. <i>To See the Queen</i> is a striking addition to contemporary poetry. Seay strikes the perfect balance between the sacrament of the mundane and the heart of the human conflict. She sings out to that need to imagine and mourn, that ache to find comfort and visualize hope.</p>

<p>Gary Jackson’s collection of poetry, <i>Missing You, Metropolis,</i> features unique subject material and authentic language. Just look at the title. Hopefully you recognize Metropolis and connect it to something in your past—think back to red capes and a countless number of action-packed comic strips. And just as the title suggests, Jackson’s writing has everything to do with the fantastical world of superhero legends, including references to Superman, Spiderman, Batman and X-men.</p>
<p>His quirky and original writing style makes his poems enjoyable and easy to read. The author straddles the threshold between somber, serious tone and silly, unnecessary fluff by creating a fresh and un-clichéd idea of normal super human beings. Whether it’s “In a Conversation about Superheroes,” where young boys debate and fantasize about Mystique (the Invisible Woman, Storm and Shadowcat), or in “Upon Seeing Spider-Man on my Way to Work,” where the narrator dreams about what it would be like to be the “bastard webslinging over electric Soho,” Jackson creates an extremely entertaining flashback to comic books, TV shows and superhero movies for the reader to relive.</p>
<p>Not every reader has to be a die-hard fan of comic book legends to appreciate Jackson’s work. This poet is capable of capturing a wide range of audiences: he explores beyond the celebrated superhero status by delving deep into the more intimate and emotional details of the characters’ lives. In the poem “When Loving a Man Becomes too Hard,” the speaker reveals, “Mary Jane confesses she sometimes makes Peter wear the costume when they fuck,” creating a scenario between Spiderman and The Incredible Hulk’s respective lovers, Mary Jane and Betty Ross. The women, over a bottle of good merlot, ponder their romantic relationships and admit somewhat dark humor memories of their bedroom experiences. Jackson’s vivid descriptions of human emotion and his frank writing style bring a sense of truth and reality to his collection of poetry.</p>
<p>Jackson magnifies everyday conflicts, dilemmas and scenarios by applying them to superheroes—the distorted versions of human beings. His portrayal of superheroes as if they are everyday figures make his readers question whether there is a real difference between the invincible figures in the sky and the civilians on the street. Winner of the 2009 Cave Canem Poetry Prize, Jackson brings childhood back in a more adult way.</p>
<p>Excerpt from “The Dilemma of Lois Lane”</p>
<p>And I don’t know which man<br />
is real. Sometimes,<br />
when we’re alone at home,<br />
fixing dinner, you’ll pretend</p>
<p>to wince when you cut yourself,<br />
and I find myself hoping<br />
that the tiniest drop of blood<br />
will bloom on your finger.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">Natalie Diaz opens her debut collection of poetry, <i>When My Brother Was an Aztec</i>, with the Spanish proverb, “No hay mal que dure cien anos, ni cuerpo que lo resista,” to introduce the reader to the Spanish influence on Native Americans, a theme that runs rampant throughout her poetry via allusions to or inclusions of Spanish words.  The proverb translates as, “Nothing lasts forever; this too shall pass,” a hopeful remark that suggests Diaz’s ability to cope with life both on and after the reservation.  Her forty-six poems consider the hardships of Native American life after colonization and Christianization.  Diaz throws the reader right into the middle of drug and alcohol abuse, racism, and diabetes, proving the enduring effects of post-colonial traumatic stress disorder.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">The collection features three sections that represent different aspects of Diaz’s experiences.  The first largely focuses on Diaz’s diabetic grandmother, the second on her drug-addict of a brother, and the third on the sadness and pain that accompanies reservation life.  Some of Diaz’s poems will wound a reader—its beautifully crafted language still cannot mask the sharp, stinging pains that come from reading of her Aztec brother, relentless racism, or her diabetic grandmother.  In “The Beauty of a Busted Fruit” the speaker remembers her childhood of wanting scars to prove her endurance but admits:</p>
<blockquote><p>           All this before we knew that some wounds can’t heal,<br />
before we knew the jagged scars of Great-Grandmother’s<br />
amputated legs, the way a rock can split a man’s head<br />
open to its red syrup, like a watermelon, the way a brother<br />
can pick at his skin for snakes and spiders only he can see.</p></blockquote>
<p>The speaker provides these horrifying images in a poem so beautiful that by the end of it the reader has almost forgotten what he has just learned—yet these jarring images remain, shaking the reader from complacency.  Diaz demonstrates that she has learned “to see the beauty of a busted fruit,” intimating that she loves not despite all of these imperfections, but instead <i>for </i>these imperfections.<i> </i></p>
<p><i>When My Brother Was an Aztec</i> reflects Diaz’s experiences as a Native American living on the reservation.  She admits that much of her poetry is autobiographical, and therefore the reader can often replace the speaker with the author herself.  This intimate experience offers a moving and convincing connection to the author, something that a reader cannot often guarantee from a novel or a poetry collection.  Diaz doesn’t hold back from the truth, and the reader begins to see Diaz’s poetry as her own means of coping with Historical Trauma.</p>
<p>Even before the first section, Diaz opens with her title poem, “When My Brother Was an Aztec.”  This is the first impression the reader has of Diaz’s poetry, and it is not one to forget.  The poem recounts Diaz’s experiences with her meth-addict brother and how his drug abuse unravels their family.  She shows the reader how he “sacrificed [her] parents / every morning,” forced them to “[forget] who was dying, who was already dead.”  He “gobbled” the “crushed diamonds and fire,” portraying him as an animal, a monster, who turned her family’s house into a zoo.  Yet despite his devastating and self-destructive habits, Diaz remarks how her “parents’ hearts kept / growing back,” suggesting the unconditional love that comes with family, no matter how much hurt a son or brother can cause.  The reader’s first impression of Diaz’s poetry is of unabashed honesty that evokes sympathy and heartbreak.</p>
<p>Diaz experiments with structure in many of her poems to prove how the organization of a poem is every bit as important as its content.  “When My Brother Was an Aztec” follows a stair-step pattern to show that as Diaz and her family follow her brother farther and farther down his destructive path, there is no way to return.  “Hand-Me-Down Halloween,” an endearing and heart-wrenching recollection of the speaker’s first Halloween off the reservation, uses slashes to break up clusters of words.  When the reader omits the words between every other set of slashes, s/he removes the skin-color designations and, subsequently, the emotional impact of the poem.  “Abecedarian Requiring Further Examination of Anglikan Seraphym Subjugation of a Wild Indian Rezervation,” uses an elementary technique reserved for learning: the first line begins with A, the next with B, the third with C, and so on and so forth until Z.  Diaz also makes sure to include each letter of the alphabet in the title, hence why certain words feature alternate spellings.</p>
<p>Joining writers like Louise Erdrich and Sherman Alexie, Diaz cements her place in Native writing by portraying the suffering that comes from colonization.  She alternates between startling, vulgar imagery and stunning, powerful language to engage the reader in Native storytelling.</p>

Like <em>The Enemy </em>and his earlier books, it deploys a dazzling pharmacopeia of received forms to treat a wide range of identities and situations, including the vocation of healing; immigrant experience; the challenge of sustaining romantic love and marriage to another man in a homophobic culture; and teaching and mentoring from both sides of the desk. Author of <em>The Desire To Heal,</em> a compelling book of essays concerning poetry and medicine, Campo is also finishing a third nonfiction collection, <em>Can We Save the Art of Medicine?: Essays on the Humanities, Culture, and Medicine.</em><br />
Campo’s honors include a National Poetry Series Award, Lambda Literary Awards, a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship, the Annual Achievement Award from the National Hispanic Academy of Arts and Sciences, a Pushcart Prize, and the Sheila Motton Book Prize from the New England Poetry Club. He is also the recipient of the Nicholas E. Davies Memorial Scholar Award from the American College of Physicians, given for outstanding humanism in medicine. A graduate of Amherst College and Harvard Medical School, he currently teaches and practices general internal medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, where his medical practice serves mostly Latinos, gay/ lesbian/ bisexual/ transgendered people, and people with HIV infection. He is also on the faculty of the Lesley University Creative Writing MFA program. His poetry and prose have appeared in anthologies such as<em> Best American Poetry</em> and in numerous periodicals, including<em> Boston Review, Kenyon Review, The Lancet, Los Angeles Times, The Nation, New England Journal of Medicine, New York Times Magazine, The New Republic, Paris Review, The Progressive, Salon.com, Slate.com, Threepenny Review, Yale Review, </em>and<em> the Washington Post Book World</em>. Wheeler and Campo spoke in Boston in the spring of 2013.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/632/files/2014/02/alt-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-305 alignright" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/632/files/2014/02/alt-med.jpg" alt="alt med" width="183" height="300" /></a><br />
Lesley Wheeler</strong>: You just performed a poem called “On the Wards” during a panel celebrating <em>The Bellevue Literary Review</em>. It’s from your new collection, <em>Alternative Medicine</em>, which I’ve been reading in typescript. The kindness of that poem particularly struck me. “On the Wards” considers simply looking, paying attention, as a mode of healing.</p>
<p><strong>Rafael Campo</strong>: Sometimes, in my experience on the wards, in the very busy medical world, we believe we don’t have time to fulfill one of the primary functions of the healer: to bear witness. Part of bearing witness is actually seeing the person sitting in front of you in the clinic or lying in bed in the hospital. From the poet’s perspective it’s important as well, seeing in that detailed, focused way, noticing the bruise where the IV has been placed and the other ways the body is marked by the experience of illness.</p>
<p>That translates also into attentive listening: not only how we gaze upon our patients who aren’t accustomed to being seen anymore, but how we attend to their voices. And that gets to the larger issue of how biomedicine silences the patient, appropriates the narrative, translates it into medicalese, locating us ever further away from what that person feels, what we see in her face, the ways her body is altered by what we’re doing. It’s to me one of the great gifts of being a poet in the medical world: to always be reminded of how important that acuity of observation and listening truly is in our work. I certainly feel it helps me be a more effective healer.</p>
<p>The particular encounter in that poem seemed at first like an interruption. I was briefly intersecting with a whole narrative of illness that I couldn’t possibly know because I didn’t know this patient, she was just alone on a gurney, no one else around, late at night. Then suddenly as I looked her and saw how beautiful she was, I felt myself to be a participant in what she was going through—I was a witness to her experience and I needed to do more than avert my eyes. I needed to look at her and form that connection, however fleeting it might be.</p>
<p><strong>Wheeler</strong>: You joked at the reading about your work being dark and depressing, but one of the most salient aspects of your writing is its compassion. You’re constantly noticing how beautiful other human beings are, how worthy of love, and you’re always considering the intersections between your story and their stories. Part of that ongoing mission is exploring what doctors really feel as they face sickness in others. Starting with your first books of poetry and prose, you’ve written about the eros of the doctor-patient relationship. In <em>Alternative Medicine</em>, there’s a poem, “Reforming Health Care,” about feeling grateful to be needed, and another, “The Performance,” about an experience of joy in a children’s cancer ward. Would you talk about the role of a healer’s emotions in your project?</p>
<p><strong>Campo</strong>: That kind of presence or engagement is central to what I’m hoping to do. We tend to work in silence in medicine. We silence our patients, we silence ourselves. I think of when the endotracheal tube goes in, and the patient can’t speak, and there’s a palpable sigh of relief amongst everyone in the operating room: okay, now we’re in control, we’re not going to have to listen to the patient’s perspective, we’re going to focus. That’s very telling.<br />
Our culture at large does some of the same kind of work, silencing those who are in pain, who are suffering. Yet patients remind us that silence equals death. During my medical training days, that SILENCE=DEATH slogan was something I heard at Act Up rallies, and I remembered that was something Audre Lorde had said too.</p>
<p>We need as physicians to be participants in these narratives, share them with our patients. There’s a pervasive belief in the medical profession that if we don’t distance ourselves emotionally, our judgment will be clouded, we won’t be able to make the right decision about the emergency intervention that needs to happen. And even beyond that, there’s anxiety around the issue of who really owns the narrative of illness. I think some physicians worry if they share in these narratives they’re appropriating them in a different way, as compared to simply translating them into medicalese. There is, unfortunately, some writing by doctors that aggrandizes the physician at the expense of the patient. These are all contributing factors to why we distance ourselves. And of course we’re trained very explicitly at medical schools and in residencies to distance ourselves, not to engage emotionally. “Just the facts, just the data,” is the mantra. All of these factors conspire to remove us from the experiences of our patients. We have to resist actively the impulse to avert our eyes, to shield ourselves from what our patients feel, to subtract from their humanness by focusing on the heartless, purely fact-based narratives we record in their charts.</p>
<p>I also want to represent myself as the speaker of my poems as just as human, just as conflicted and flawed and joyous and depressed as any of us are. And some things we experience in the hospital are joyful—the births of babies, when someone is cured, when the bandages come off and someone sees again, those are ecstatic moments. We ought to participate empathetically in those as well.</p>
<p><strong>Wheeler</strong>: Working with HIV patients has been a vocation for you and a major subject of your writing across genres. Will you talk about why?</p>
<p><strong>Campo</strong>: To some extent it relates to my personal identity as a gay Latino man and feeling deeply connected to two communities devastated by this disease. I’m also skeptical of the biomedical model as to the cure, the solution to this pandemic. Just recently we’ve been hearing about a baby cured of AIDS: “Isn’t that miraculous?” As wonderful as such a story is, as tremendous as the medical advances have been in the treatment of HIV infection, we have to remember there are aspects of human suffering medicine will never be able to explicate away.  Yes, HIV and AIDS treatment appears to be a tremendous success story. Yet there are still forty million people around the globe infected with HIV, most of whom are going to die because they do not have access to or can’t afford the cost of our life-prolonging therapies. HIV and AIDS is one of those territories in which we’re reminded both of the incredible power of the biomedical model and also its persistent limitations.</p>
<p>Also, this notion that we’re post emergency now, that the pandemic is over, that we need to concentrate on other things—it’s extraordinary that can even be contemplated! We certainly have not cured AIDS and we certainly haven’t prevented its ongoing transmission either. There are still so many lessons to be learned and so many silences to be overcome. It’s also still a stigmatized condition here in the US and elsewhere—I think our eagerness to forget about AIDS is on some level an expression of our continuing fear of a disease still attached to powerfully negative metaphoric thinking, as Susan Sontag describes so insightfully in her essay &#8220;AIDS and Its Metaphors.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Wheeler</strong>: In thinking about your recurring subjects, including HIV and AIDS, I wonder how and why you choose one genre or another to approach the material.</p>
<p><strong>Campo</strong>: In some ways the poems develop much more viscerally—a lot of my encounters with patients, mediated through the amplified listening of stethoscope, or through the X-ray vision of imaging technologies, take shape more easily through poetry. The essay is more work for me, although I hope my essays capture some of the lyricism I hear and observe in the body. Prose for me is more aligned with the explanatory gestures of biomedicine, which I suppose I resist in so many ways. I go to the poem first because of the complicated relationship I have with the narrative prose line. I feel myself to be more vexed when writing an essay. I want to be showing and not telling, although of course the best essays do that too.</p>
<p>Poetry comes to me much less arduously. It has something to do with empathy, too, I suspect. I’ve been told so many times by cynical colleagues in medicine when I try to bring poetry onto the wards that empathy can’t be defined, can’t be explained, can’t be narrated—yet it does seem to be enacted in the best poems. When we read or hear a poem that’s truly effective, we feel what the speaker’s feeling, we experience an entire immersion of ourselves in another’s consciousness. It engulfs us, takes hold of us physically. Its concision demands the participation of another in order to achieve completeness, to attain full meaning. It’s harder to achieve that effect in prose, to offer the same empathetic embrace. There are probably prose writers out there, though, with the completely opposite experience!</p>
<p><strong>Wheeler</strong>: I’ve actually been reading recently about world-building in fiction. I’m really interested in poetry with this immersive effect, but all the analysis of how literature absorbs readers into alternate worlds concerns prose, novels—long forms, basically. I’ve been trying to get my head around how immersion works differently for poetry readers, when the work of literature is relatively brief.</p>
<p><strong>Campo</strong>: Maybe it has to do with the rhythms of the body. Meter and other gestures peculiar to poetry so much evoke the physical body. That can be the opening that allows us to enter into another physiology.</p>
<p>I always think of my professor at Amherst College who said novels are empathy factories. I thought, no, that’s poetry! Poetry is the empathetic gesture, the flash of recognition. Of course we experience empathy through the rich fiction we love so much, by means of character development and all the ways stories are unspooled—empathy is not the exclusive province of poetry. Certain aspects of poetry, though, are particularly inviting to empathetic experience.</p>
<p><strong>Wheeler</strong>: I think you’re right that rhythm has a lot to do with it.</p>
<p><strong>Campo</strong>: And the use of enjambment, too—when you jump from one thought to another it feels physically embodied in the line breaks. That, to me, is very gripping, utterly thrilling. I’m given over to the poet’s intuition, I’m perceiving through the poet’s senses meaning that is expressed entirely wordlessly. Also, the very shape the poem takes on the page, the ways in which lineation speaks to us through implication—the poem is so specific in its deployment and arrangement, and always reminds me of how precisely our own bodies are organized, how in biology form follows function.</p>
<p><strong>Wheeler</strong>: To stick with the essay as a form for a little longer—are there particular essayists you feel inspired by?</p>
<p><strong>Campo</strong>: I love poets’ essays in particular. Randall Jarrell. Adrienne Rich. Derek Walcott. Robert Pinsky. Mark Doty’s work: he’s a superb essayist and memoirist as well as a poet. I think of his work on HIV and AIDS; <em>Atlantis</em> is a book I go back to so often.</p>
<p>More in the medical realm, Richard Selzer’s essays are extraordinary—empathy factories as well, frequently funny, always unsentimental, as he so expressively conveys patients’ narratives through the essay’s form. Danielle Ofri, Cortney Davis, and Abraham Verghese are other examples of medical writers whose essays I find compelling. Older standbys I often revisit include Virginia Woolf and Susan Sontag.</p>
<p><strong>Wheeler</strong>: A question I’d noted down for myself, and perhaps you’ve already answered it to some degree, concerns the essay versus the poem: what you find hospitable and what you find difficult about each genre. Clearly metrical poetry is a congenial mode for you. I’m thinking particularly about that writing binge you describe in <em>The Desire to Heal</em>—that section startles me every time I reread it—when you describe drafting thirty-two sonnets in one long sitting.</p>
<p><strong>Campo</strong>: That was a binge! The floodgates opening.</p>
<p><strong>Wheeler</strong>: Poetry comes to you fluently.</p>
<p><strong>Campo</strong>: I wonder if it has to do with a primal impulse in me that goes all the way back to childhood: hearing poems in Spanish and wanting to make an imaginative journey though those poems to a place that was so forbidden to me, Cuba—this homeland at once the center of the universe and yet inaccessible. Through poems I was first able to contemplate that kind of impossible journey. Which is not to say that the poems are truly easier—in some ways they’re more difficult because of the tremendous power they seem to have over for me—but perhaps I’m drawn to them more instinctively.</p>
<p>I wonder if my affinity for poetry is also rooted in music, again something I heard at a young age that was a way of making an imaginative journey to a taboo place. I’m so drawn to formal structures in poetry, the music of it. People say writing in forms can be so difficult but for me it’s the opposite experience. There’s a fluidity to writing poetry that feels of a piece with remembering, storytelling, the earliest narratives of my own life. My parents read poetry to me as a young child, patriotic poems by José Martí, in a deliberate attempt, I think, to foster in me some kind of connection to Cuba.</p>
<p>I encountered prose as an art form later, when I was struggling with English versus Spanish and becoming conscious of the tensions between the two languages in my head. In late adolescence, early adulthood, I really resisted Spanish. I wanted to speak a masterful, polished English—not “ESL English,” English as a second language. I wanted to be unquestionably American. Now I’ve come back to an appreciation of the musicality of Spanish. I want to embrace its place in my life. Perhaps this struggle still works in me as well: I have a fraught relationship with English as a prose medium, while Spanish can be a mystical place I always want to get back to, to recover, to rediscover in poetry.</p>
<p>There’s also my writing process as a doctor: I don’t have hours and hours of time available to write. Poems take place in day-to-day life, between caring for patients, in the midst of witnessing, in the immediacy of the ER. An essay can’t happen in those moments; I can’t jot down the outlines of one on the back of a prescription pad.</p>
<p><strong>Wheeler</strong>: Like William Carlos Williams! Do you really write poems on prescription pads?</p>
<p><strong>Campo</strong>: Often I do. Although electronic medical records make that harder; we have so little paper around these days. But the spaces for writing are brief in the practice of medicine. Even when I journal, what comes out of it is usually a poem. I have an impulse to prune away rather than add on: there’s so little time, both literally and in the larger existential sense, I find myself having to cut to the essential experience. I can’t seem to escape the sense of the clock in my exam room ticking away as my patient speaks, as if measuring lives.</p>
<p><strong>Wheeler</strong>: You were just speaking about the Spanish language as a place you try to get back to. You’ve been negotiating an imaginative relationship to the country of Cuba since your first books. Has your relationship to the idea of Cuba changed over the years?</p>
<p><strong>Campo</strong>: It has, although in other ways it’s been static and constant. The static aspect is the notion of it as a forbidden island: it’s only ninety miles away but yet can never be visited. It’s an impossible place, a lost dream, a mirage—that paradox is still real for me. What’s changed, I suppose, is how I see Cuba paradoxically as an invitation, as a new, undiscovered territory. As an adult I can now form my own opinion about the revolution and my family’s history as exiles. I can begin to see Cuba as a more complex place, full of a vibrant culture that’s intensely attractive and appealing, familiar as it is unimaginable. The music, of course, but also the literature: I’ve been interested again in José Martí’s poetry lately, reading it not as I used to, as an expression of patriotism for a free nation that doesn’t exist anymore, but as living verse, intensely musical, ruefully philosophical, so much more than a mere expression of a politics.</p>
<p>I more actively contemplate visiting these days. I hope that one of those anchors of my old way of seeing Cuba, my family, changes enough that I can make that journey with them.</p>
<p><strong>Wheeler</strong>: In the critical reception of your work so far, you’ve been treated more often as a physician-poet and a gay poet, perhaps less often as a Latino poet or a formalist. How do you see yourself fitting into the very complicated field of twenty-first century poetry? What are the benefits and disadvantages of those labels, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>Campo</strong>: I see myself primarily as an aspiring poet. I studied with Derek Walcott, who told us we’re never poets until we’re dead, and even then not all of us will achieve that distinction: that’s the paradigm! All of these identities are at once enriching—they speak to each other and I hope I engage in a kind of internal dialogue fruitfully—but at the same time their conflicts can lead to difficulties. What draws me primarily to the act of writing is the pure pleasure of it, not the desire to express a specific political view or identity. For me this pleasure has mostly to do with empathy, with that opportunity for connection with fellow human beings across the many categories of identity that can be used in other ways to divide us. When we are joined in the music of our bodies, when we are able to recognize in the voice of another our own joy or anguish or vulnerability, we experience comfort—we are not alone.</p>
<p>It’s interesting to compare my more marginalized identities with the others: in particular, the experience of being gay and Latino with the experience of being a male physician. Perhaps those various vantage points allow me some insights into how power works. Inhabiting all of those worlds, I can observe from the medical perspective how marginalized communities, such as LGBT people and Latinos, suffer from health disparities, disproportionately affected by AIDS or cancer or heart disease; I also have firsthand knowledge of them, having cared for friends and family members afflicted with these conditions not as a privileged doctor but as the nameless, faceless “other” who sits at the bedside waiting for information or even just an expression of compassion that never comes. Earlier I spoke about writing poems on the back of prescription pads while caring for my own patients; when I myself felt silenced, especially when I was a resident in San Francisco, watching friends, men my own age, die of AIDS under the care of physicians who sometimes regarded them with loathing and contempt—such moments have been equally compelling calls to writing. To see identity translated into poorer health is profoundly troubling, and demands the empathetic response of the poem.</p>
<p><strong>Wheeler</strong>: A lot of the factionalization in contemporary poetry seems to be to come down to grammar, attitudes towards the sentence and how one sentence flows into another. How would you respond if I said there’s a commitment to clarity and legibility in your work? “Accessibility” is a complicated idea but it can be a dirty word in some contexts.</p>
<p><strong>Campo</strong>: I think those are great words. Perhaps because of the difficulty so many of my patients experience in making themselves visible, getting their narratives heard, I want to elevate those narratives so they can be heard by the larger culture. I sometimes get frustrated with experimental writing. I get the intellectual aspect: to play, to take pleasure in wordplay, to test language’s ability to convey meaning, or even subvert it to new purposes of simply sound-making—that feels sometimes like a luxury to me after a long day in the hospital. Of course, there’s a way writing accessibly can be critiqued as playing to the powers that be. But I also think: we are all so privileged if we have that concern at all. There are patients of mine with no voice, for whom a metaphor is a fundamental act of survival. I do find myself drawn to clarity. I want my poems to be heard and understood, although I hope they’re never facile. I want them to challenge as wide an audience as possible while still being attentive to form, the gestures of language, the relationship between language and the body, and all the many complexities of any writing that has to do with illness. That’s not to say I’m not open to all kinds of writing. I’ve experimented myself, written away from formal constraints, and I read very widely.</p>
<p>I might say one other thing related to formal poetry: sometimes people may think that to write formal verse is a capitulation to convention, for Latino or queer writers especially. Sleeping with the enemy, selling out. I can’t say I’ve experienced it in those ways. In my experience, writing in meter and rhyme has been about trying to invoke those rhythms of the body I hear so loudly and irresistibly as a doctor trained in the use of the stethoscope. I also want to see if English can sound like Spanish: can I remake English into this music I’m so in love with? Early on, maybe there was an unconscious impulse of the immigrant to master forms. But that was a long time ago. I don’t feel my project is about that at all now.</p>
<p><strong>Wheeler</strong>: I have more questions than we have time, so I’ll just run through them and you can pick one or two that interest you. First, I noticed a motif that seems like the opposite of accessibility in <em>Alternative Medicine</em>: the book makes many references to secrets and invisibility.  I wonder if that rings true to you. I’ve also been thinking about the trajectory of your poetry and how this book feels emotionally darker to me, particularly because it ends on “The Destruction of the Temples of Machu Picchu”: that last line, “they swear such a place never did exist,” hints at political pessimism, a closing down of utopian possibilities. I was going to ask you about teaching, in part because of the beautiful villanelle for your undergraduate teacher Eve Sedgwick—what did you learn from her, and how did her teaching change you? There are also the obvious closing questions of any interview: what’s next for you, what your ambitions are, whether there are subjects and modes you haven’t tackled yet that you aspire to try.</p>
<p><strong>Campo</strong>: What’s next: I am working on a new collection of essays that will explore the relevance of the humanities to medical education. It’s less autobiographical than my previous work, more of a meditation on the necessity of the humanities to the work of healing. Going back to the essay is a challenge stemming from what you were alluding to in the new book of poems, something dark and problematical: what kind of medicine do we ultimately want in this culture?  Are we even capable of imagining a culture that abets healing in the largest sense? Some of the changes upon us in the medical profession, which of course reflect the preoccupations and priorities of larger American society, are really chilling and dangerous to empathy and healing. We’ve made so many tremendous technological advances and there are so many new therapies to extend life and improve quality of life, and yet we’re becoming ever more distant from our patients, ever more specialized and fragmented in the care we provide, such that we’re experts on one tiny little aspect of the working of the body and can’t talk to a patient about his depression and how to have a more fulfilling life. It’s also increasingly difficult for doctors, who are still largely white and largely male, to speak across these diverse identities we’ve discussed, to be present empathetically for patients who come to us from so many different walks of life, cultural identities, languages, races, sexualities. We need to be able to engage culture through our work as doctors. Not to mention the change people are most worried about, the reimbursement of care in a way that exerts intolerable time constraints on our work with patients. I hope this new book will help us think together about what kind of medicine we actually want and need.</p>
<p><strong>Wheeler</strong>: This strikes me as strongly parallel to the conversations we’re having as teachers about MOOCs, or massive open online courses. There’s a value to them—online courses can provide a certain kind of education very cheaply—but it’s difficult for me to see them as even the same kind of animal as the courses I teach, which are all about attention and listening.</p>
<p><strong>Campo</strong>: Exactly. I hear over and over, what’s the use of the humanities anyway? I’m on the board of trustees at Amherst College, my alma mater, a liberal arts college, and we hear sometimes from parents: what is my kid going to do with a degree in Philosophy? I’m spending sixty thousand dollars a year, and what kind of a job can she get as an Art History major?</p>
<p>I am here to say as a physician that I can’t imagine the work of healing without the arts, the humanities, the context that helps me make sense of what I see every day, to place the decisions I help patients to reach about treatment options in an ethical context, to recognize that health and disease are not simply a function of physiology but are also impacted and defined by social and cultural forces. It’s unthinkable to me, but humanities budgets are being cut. Fewer students major in the humanities now. Writing programs are seeing declines in enrollment—it’s a concern in every aspect of the arts. But we need the humanities. As a primary care physician, I use what I learned in my English classes at Amherst much more than I use the knowledge I acquired in my biochemistry classes at Harvard Medical School. We need to make a clearer argument for the relevance of study in the humanities and why it will always be critically important to us, not matter what profession we enter or type of work we do.</p>
<p>Really, the scientific model is limited. Human beings are not equations that can be solved, nor are we hypotheses to be tested. We are not experiments. I hope we never arrive at a world where we’ve explicated everything about the human condition through the sciences. That’s a cold, soulless world. I don’t want a supercomputer like IBM’s Watson telling me I have lymphoma because I entered in my twelve symptoms and that’s what the algorithm spits out. I don’t want a doctor who’s a robot. I want a doctor to be present with me as she tells me, “You have cancer and this is what we’re going to do next.” Of course I want the latest treatment, but if there isn’t one, I want that doctor, again, to be present with me, to maybe share a poem with me, to warm my hand in the ICU, to laugh or to cry with me.<br />
We still seek that when we are ill, not only to be cured, but to be healed. The signal works of the human imagination teach us how to be present with each other in just this way.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8212; for Ivonne, five years post-cancer</p>
<p>The sternum’s gladiolus (L: small sword) bisects<br />
the chest cavity coronally where the wan<br />
blood&#8217;s re-oxygenated just beneath your sweater&#8217;s V,<br />
the monotonous muscle squeezing out its tattoo,<br />
as it must in order to square<br />
things with the lungs, the cells&#8230;. And yet, the weathered</p>
<p>heart pumps, we’re nearly certain, some special ethered<br />
serum through the works, Eros launching a dart at one sex<br />
or the other – (bead straight, conclusion fore-<br />
gone, a magician’s wand)<br />
and the clock-work lub and dub’ll<br />
swell to the chords of a Beethoven’s Fifth</p>
<p>once rightly agitated, years of pent<br />
up stuff outing like a split atom. They&#8217;re heard,<br />
though each throb’s a batter at the walls, reminders of debil-<br />
ities to come, each a palpable denial of Berkley&#8217;s ghostly physics &#8212;<br />
&#8220;too subtle for the airiest human head,&#8221; says Byron in Don Juan<br />
and so patently absurd, Dr. Johnson, indignant, swung forth</p>
<p>his cocked, refuting foot with “mighty force”<br />
into a rock one Sunday outside church (if I’ve<br />
recalled the Life correctly). Yet neither could deny the onus<br />
the heart bears and I listen sometimes, try-<br />
ing to trace the thousand zigs<br />
and zags of its circuit, pulse bedevil-</p>
<p>ing my good sleep with a rising audible<br />
twanging like dots and dashes from some for-<br />
eign, occupied shore. Or, it’s simply mice – one seeks<br />
a way out, tap tapping behind the walls, his vague syncho-<br />
pations signaling the blind mouse behind whose own tapping treble<br />
and bass leads the next – as if all, at last, might stumble on some hard-won</p>
<p>explanation that lays out plainly for me, one<br />
unifying field accounting for two<br />
hemispheres of brain where dwells a three-<br />
personed (Harpo, Chico, Groucho?) god and four<br />
truths noble enough to focus all five<br />
senses, lit up like candles on day six,</p>
<p>so that I, even now, dulled and daily numb-<br />
er, grope still to decipher the infinite<br />
odds of my good luck, my fumbling digits touching, again, your horrible, miraculous scars.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An olive hue, too, says my wife. Close to sleep<br />
we&#8217;ve sailed, adrift and determined<br />
as Bligh himself, from Bounty to Christian</p>
<p>to Gauguin&#8217;s self-possessed women. Stars and moon<br />
and then a comet beyond our window, and I’m off<br />
on Haley&#8217;s (long A when I was a boy) breasting</p>
<p>the planets&#8217; cross-currents, swimming past Earth<br />
in 76-year circuits as on the birth and death of<br />
Mark Twain, a man who made his name a pun</p>
<p>and plumbed the depths of human folly, returning<br />
(the comet), a ball of ice and wedding-gown train<br />
of dust – pronounced, strangely now</p>
<p>in my middle age, to rhyme, short A, with valley<br />
– like Rudy? she mumbles back to me, who sang<br />
charming songs of love? or where we shall walk through,</p>
<p>fearing – should, like a silk hankie, our prayers touch lightly<br />
the brow of a pleased God – no evil? His songs (Vallee&#8217;s)<br />
were proclaimed through the large end of a cone</p>
<p>and my mind narrows to Roy Cohn, a small<br />
unhappy man, who’d made his name upon<br />
plucking from men and women – he loved</p>
<p>men and was angry – their own good names. But yes,<br />
a cone, a megaphone, making Vallee&#8217;s voice larger, bolder,<br />
just as a microscope once made, hidden from the eyes of men</p>
<p>and women, the tiny comets of protoplasm and spermatozoa<br />
grow large beneath the eyes, I tell her, of Anton van Leeuwenhoek,<br />
cloth merchant, who ground lenses to inspect the woof and warp</p>
<p>of his bolts (yards of lush embroidered fabric,<br />
not fire from an angry sky) adjusting left and right<br />
the glasses of his meticulous machine to observe</p>
<p>the busy lives of mites and cells in the Delft<br />
of 1670, the lens, beveled all around and lentil shaped<br />
from which its name was lent and … Forty days</p>
<p>of forsaken pleasures? or, like Polonius,<br />
that which should neither be borrowed nor….<br />
Poor Polonius, a parent, like ourselves, given to giving</p>
<p>parental advice, even if poorly, that his children&#8217;s poor choices<br />
may not one day come crashing fierily about their shoulders<br />
or, bacteria-like, wheedle invisibly beneath the skin</p>
<p>to blossom on the forehead in fever. Polonius<br />
in unhappy Elsinore could not ascribe such heartache<br />
to microbes, their troubles – fathers and children –</p>
<p>came large – stabbed and poisoned and, when ground between<br />
a thoughtless boyfriend and thoughtless father,<br />
drowned. They fuck you up your mum and dad, your kids,</p>
<p>your equivocating sweetheart who, finally, at Elsinore,<br />
was himself Xed out like girlfriend and mother who possessed<br />
the two XXes that attach men to women, winsome Ophelia</p>
<p>longing all the while for something beyond<br />
her reach, unable to attach her suspecting suitor<br />
to herself with a lust sufficient by the 20th century</p>
<p>to warrant three bold marquee XXXes and which blossoms freely<br />
in the bonobo, our near genetic twins, separated princes<br />
and paupers, who tap out on their computers</p>
<p>simple picture-sentences: “I am hungry.”<br />
“Where is my toy?” when not engaged in exuberant,<br />
dyad, triad, and group monkey sex (don&#8217;t, she says,</p>
<p>get any ideas) and who, given enough typewriters,<br />
might, fingers rough on the keyboard buttons,<br />
sign their letters with four sincere XXXXes</p>
<p>to convey simply, wondrously, their heart’s<br />
most wild affection for girlfriend and beau<br />
…from which Cupid shoots his Eros? Straight</p>
<p>through our excess? our cupidity? hitting the mark<br />
marking the spot, finding the there there<br />
we’d always hoped was there, making it glow brighter</p>
<p>than Haley&#8217;s, than Halley&#8217;s, no larger than an apple<br />
in the outstretched palm of our brightest angel who,<br />
longing for something beyond his reach, fell past stars</p>
<p>and planets to land here, on ours, having had a Word<br />
with an ex who turned His broad back everywhere<br />
and all at once as if even He</p>
<p>could call the whole thing off.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>White thorn, crimson hips.<br />
Pleasures of the without.  Pain of the without.</p>
<p>Venus tucks low here, disappearing<br />
into the mountains’ stadia.</p>
<p>What I can’t say, stepping into foreign tense<br />
of river, magnetic sluice, arctic tongs,</p>
<p>far-off source without mercy or care for me.<br />
My love has stories not mine to know</p>
<p>or ever tell.  Bruised fringe, black &amp; white maiden hair,<br />
lupine, fox ferns, do I project?</p>
<p>Sometimes.  I have a rash beneath my shirt,<br />
pubis to lonely breasts.  To pass a melancholy hour,</p>
<p>John Clare copied from the <i>Stamford Mercury<br />
</i>news of the elderly:   old lady by name of Faunt,</p>
<p>who at 105 “has lately cut new teeth,”<br />
a parish clerk, 115, “now able to read without spectacles,</p>
<p>&amp; dig graves.”  Sad swipe of late middle age,<br />
waters brutishly beautiful &amp; full of flame.</p>
<p>Thus runs the world alway, &amp; we incurable<br />
in its sway.  Say it:  the world taketh.</p>
<p>But even its farthest reach is ours,<br />
shed molar of horizon I pluck up &amp; carry, wet, away.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A plastic fawn, palm-sized, lives on my office desk. He gazes at my open office door. His right front hoof is raised, poised for haste.</p>
<p>The deer of my Mississippi childhood were the Virginia whitetail, <i>Odocoileus virginianus virginianus</i>. As a child ten years or so, fresh from reading Felix Salten’s <i>Bambi</i>, I rested my forehead against backseat car windows and took in miles and miles of Mississippi forest. Commutes between school and our isolated house were long. I imagined myself a whitetailed doe, keeping up with the car through those woods, a blur of velvet hide and muscle.</p>
<p>I now walk to campus in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The <i>odocoileus virginianus virginianus, </i>the Virginia whitetail, emerge from the battlefields, animal grace among memorials and hardwoods. My round-eyed dog and I greet all deer with silence when we exercise in the morning light.</p>
<p>My toy fawn is a whitetail. On the job in my office, he has my back while I peck at my computer, even though he cannot know that I hear the student or the fellow professor before he sees them. Sometimes I reward him for his diligence. He holidays with a toy brontosaurus in my desktop terrarium. “Winter garden” my student from New Zealand calls it, a name I find lovely.</p>
<p>As a child of ten years or so I had a Disney Bambi bedspread, a modest covering for any young girl’s bed furnishing a bedroom in a one story rancher, a house on a mowed lawn, a residence that in a cropped picture could be part of an established a cul-de-sac. But if the photographer panned out, she would reveal barbed wire fencing and overgrown thorny bushes in sunbaked pastures. And if the photographer zoomed in on the cut green grass, she would see mosquitoes swarming, fire ants presiding, weeds encroaching. Inside that rural house in the depths of Mississippi a child of ten years or so could walk barefoot into her bedroom and find her stepfather sprawled on her bed, nude, his privates mashed into Bambi’s face.</p>
<p>No safe territory exists for the Virginia whitetail. From alligators down south to wolves up north, the whitetail deer is prey. We humans hunt deer for sport and for food. We humans do not possess the necessary reflexes to avoid running our cars and trucks right into a deer on a dark country road.</p>
<p>The first time a doe found me, a girl of six or so years old, sitting on my haunches in an old roadbed, my red knee socks quite a pop of color against the autumn leaves covering the ground, she stared deep and she stared true. Regal, she scanned my soul. She weighed my goodness. Perhaps she saw that I wanted, more than anything, to be different from the man who held the title to the land on which we found ourselves, the man my mother had married. Perhaps the doe in her eternal gaze could forsee that I would flee Mississippi and eventually find refuge in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Maybe she saw the future, me laughing during dinner in a two-story home with my husband, two children, and a round-eyed dog, a home with no secrets except at Christmastime.</p>
<p>In most US states, deer hunting is illegal on Christmas Day, including Pennsylvania. For the first time in almost one hundred years, no Pennsylvania hunter accidentally killed a fellow hunter during hunting season. Upon finding a dead hunter in the woods Bambi’s stag mentor says that the human is “just the same as we are. He has the same fears, the same needs, and suffers in the same way.”</p>
<p>As my father was dying of cancer he requested that his body donated to science. His Agent Orange induced cancer had stalked his liver, his kidneys, his lungs, and finally his brain. My father envisioned others studying his corpse, a failed battle map, finding some small secret, a way to undermine the hunter. No medical school honored his request. Perhaps his body had been too damaged to be of use.</p>
<p>Even though the deer has natural predators, they nevertheless can overpopulate. At a nuclear physics laboratory in the hills of Tennessee, as in other places around the country, annual hunts keep the deer numbers in check. But in Tennessee, hunters go through an extra procedure. Back when the laboratory had, as its first priority, a mission to develop a fission bomb before the Nazis did, before the Russians did, mistakes were made in terms of environmental waste. As a result, the woods around this nuclear physics laboratory in the green hills of Tennessee have water and soil that has been activated, contaminated, by radiation. Deer eating the foliage, drinking the pond water, may become activated too. Strontium, like Marie Curie’s radium, is a bone seeker. If the dead buck or doe has a dose higher than one and a half times the background radiation levels, the deer carcass is retained by the laboratory, too damaged to be of use.</p>
<p>A girl, six or ten or thirteen years old, squats on her haunches in an old Mississippi roadbed, her socks a pop of color against the autumn leaves. If the child is patient, the whitetail will seem to welcome the company. That doe, that sylvan queen, will over many visits show the child a hidden light and high beauty forever beyond the reach of man. The child will learn that any injustice, any hurt at the hands of another is only a small and passing thing. And in times of darkness, the child imagines a future where she, like the whitetail, could sprint at thirty miles per hour, leap over an adult’s head, and disappear.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The two women stood from the augured hole as ice crystallized on the fishing line. Beth rolled her lips over her teeth and bit down. Her incisors ached with the cold and blowing snow. Finally, Henry asked, “Did you touch him?”</p>
<p>Beth fisted her fingers in both pockets and turned to Henry: her eyes dark stones.</p>
<p>A wave of heat broke against Beth’s sternum and across her hairline. She swallowed the saliva at the back of her throat, and watched Henry chew the inside of her cheek while she waited for Beth’s answer, the fringe of Henry’s gray hair whipping in the wind. Beth said, “To hug him hello and good-bye, just like I did with you but less often.”</p>
<p>“You never kissed him?”</p>
<p>“I never anything-ed with him. He never knew.”</p>
<p>“You never told him.”</p>
<p>“How could I?”</p>
<p>“You just told me.” Henry turned and stomped to the second tip up hole, away from Beth.</p>
<p>Beth looked back at the Humdinger, the portable ice house they bought last year from Cabela’s Bargain Cave just weeks after Leonard died, three years after Rags’ death. The Humdinger nestled fifty yards from the next closest ice house, Hard Up, a permanent house made of plywood and 2x4s painted camouflaged green and brown. The other mismatched houses on Steward’s Lump—Going Fishing, Marty, Trash House, Master Baiter—seemed uncharacteristically peaceful. The snow muffled sounds of shouted curses and crushed beer cans; the haze of the blizzard softened primary colors and blaze orange. The Trash House’s pile of empty beer cases, propane tanks, busted chairs and buckets was covered in white.</p>
<p>The Humdinger appeared tight and safe. Before today, Beth had imagined Henry’s reaction in the canvas walls—maybe nodding, maybe even thanking Beth for loving Henry’s husband Leonard when she couldn’t. Not this.</p>
<p>Beth blinked back the sting at the corners of her eyes, looked up at the sky—flat gray, no shade change, no cloud shape, just thick lead. Snowflakes landed on her lashes, something that used to make her feel beautiful.</p>
<p>Turning, she saw Henry stooped over their other tip up. Beth marched towards the hole, her face burning in its flush. The ice gagged under her feet.</p>
<p>Henry clenched and splayed her mittenless hand and said, “Dug into the damn minnow bucket with my bare hand instead of the scoop.” She pulled her lips into a circle and sucked in a breath, “Fucking stupid.” Henry jammed her hand back into her mitten. “It’s burning. Think I’m gonna puke.”</p>
<p>Taking her friend’s mittened hand, Beth rubbed it hard. Henry’s face was white, green at the edges, her lips the color of a crappie belly. She felt Henry’s knuckles and thought of her fingernails like creek pebbles. Beth said, “I never loved him more than I loved you.”</p>
<p>Henry huffed, yanked her hand away, and stomped to the Humdinger. Beth rebaited the hook, lowered the line, and reset the tip up. Icy crystals ticked against the orange plastic flag. A shout came from one of the ice shacks. Across the lake snowmobiles whined, then nothing. The hole in the ice glazed. They weren’t going to catch a thing.</p>
<p>Beth looked over her shoulder, but the Humdinger revealed nothing. She glanced to the plowed ice road they’d driven in on and her Jeep. She’d named the Wrangler Sir Wildgin when she bought it for her sixtieth birthday, the fourth she had celebrated without Henry during the Moratorium. Beth had been sick of her practical Crown Vic. People assumed she was a cop, which was fun the first couple of years since she flashed her high beams at friends and got them to pull over, but she was always stuck behind slow pokes who thought she would give them a ticket. She wanted to be young and spunky, fun and unpredictable again. Every year as soon as it hit fifty degrees, she took the top off the Jeep and drove all over town, into Alexandria, down around the rich lake homes, blasting the Bee Gees or Bob Marley with the wind in her hair, trying to reclaim something lost.</p>
<p>She checked the tip up and glanced back to the shore. A herd of kids they’d passed on the drive out, maybe a dozen of them, were making a rink—an awful day for it. The foolishness of youth. She had to squint her memory to see her own similar days. The ice boat she and Henry had made in high school, the only girls in the tri-county competition.</p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">As Beth got to know the feeling of wanting Leonard fourteen years ago, she took to wearing her shoulder-length hair up. Tarnished brown and streaked with silver, Beth fought her hair into a ponytail or a falling apart French twist in the obscene notion that Leonard might see her neck and want to touch it. As if the plush of the twenty pounds she should lose made her neck supple, not fat. As if the three moles that had appeared in the shape of a boomerang under her left ear would tempt him.</p>
<p>Beth couldn’t have said exactly when she fell in love with Leonard. In the beginning, it wasn’t that kind of a love. It was more like what she felt for Henry. Until then, one day, it wasn’t because she found herself sitting at their kitchen table over venison sloppy joes and lima beans, wondering what Leonard looked like if his flannel shirt was unbuttoned, and what his beat up old hands might feel like at her low back.</p>
<p>There’d been a handful of moments before the Moratorium, sometimes with as many as two years in between them, when Leonard seemed to actually see Beth. Once, forty-five years into knowing him, she’d arrived at the farm, and the power had gone out. The air was cool and scrubbed, still ringing with ozone, lilac leaves dripping, and the good earth scent drifting up from the fields. Leonard sat on the steps in a clean t-shirt, hair still damp from a shower, his thin frame poised with the grace and strength of a buck. Henry nowhere to be seen. Low and sweet he’d said, “Come watch the fireflies with me, Bethesda.”</p>
<p>“Only if you don’t call me that, Leonard.”</p>
<p>“Why? You don’t like it?”</p>
<p>“It sounds like a witch’s name.”</p>
<p>“Exactly right. You’re bewitching.”</p>
<p>When she’d gone to sit by his side, he reached for her hand and her breath caught. He buttoned the cuff of her shirtsleeve, and she waited for his eyes to make contact with hers, felt his sandpaper fingers on her skin, a touch that electrified her. She could smell Ivory soap mixing with his heat. She thanked him and still waited for his eyes, but he was transfixed by the lightning bugs, and that, too, was charming.</p>
<p>The Brasselman brothers: Leonard and Rags. Leonard three years older and Henry’s husband for forty-two years until his heart attack last year. Rags the one Henry loved for the last thirty-five of those years, though he was married to, and raising children with, Diane until he died four years ago. In most of that time, Beth dated serially. And then she fell for Leonard. And after that, she started the Moratorium, hoping to someday return to the farmhouse, knowing that could only happen if Leonard or Henry was dead.</p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">Back in the Humdinger, Beth gave Henry a new beer, and opened one for herself.</p>
<p>Henry nodded toward the Humdinger’s plasticized window and said, “We should buy a motorized augur. That guy’s cut three holes in the time it took us to cut one.” She added, “Makes us look like amateurs.”</p>
<p>“I know. And you want a permanent ice house when we always said the great part about the Humdinger is that we can take her anywhere.”</p>
<p>“But we don’t go anywhere. We just go here.”</p>
<p>Beth said nothing. She stretched her pinching back and checked her line. Without looking at Henry, she asked, “Did you know?”</p>
<p>Henry shook her head and said, “No.” She rubbed at her knee with a mittened hand. “I guess I thought you two were just like siblings.” She jigged her rod, sipped her beer. She turned the heater up a notch, wouldn’t look at Beth. “Just because I don’t obsess about sex like you, doesn’t mean we didn’t have sex. I didn’t deprive him,” said Henry.</p>
<p>“I didn’t say you did.” Beth sighed and jigged her rod. She pinched the inside of her lip between her molars. “I told you I loved him. Which I did. And he didn’t love me.” Her skin flushed in another hot wave. Sweat gathered at her neck, a drip rivuleting to her cleavage. Her palms perspired inside her mittens, though her fingertips were numb. “I’m glad you had so much hot fucking together. That’s really great.”</p>
<p>“Bethesda.”</p>
<p>“Henrietta.”</p>
<p>They were silent a long time. Beth stood and peered out the Humdinger’s window to see if the tip ups’ flags had gone off. Neither had. Henry hated the window, couldn’t understand how in this day and age there wasn’t plastic that could be seen through clearly. Beth always argued in favor of the haze. She liked the world muffled and blurred.</p>
<p>In the distance, snowmobilers opened their throttles on the uninterrupted plane of the lake. When the sound was gone, Beth said, “I’m sorry, Henry. Maybe I shouldn’t have told you.”</p>
<p>“I mean I knew there had to be something. Your best friend doesn’t just vanish.” Henry jigged and sipped her beer. She spoke to the hole in the ice. “I tried to ask Leonard about it. I thought maybe he’d done something to offend you.” Henry flipped the handle of her reel once and held the rod still. “I considered it, of course. But I couldn’t think of a single time I’d ever seen him love you or you him. I knew the way I was about Rags before he’d made his decision about staying with Diane, and even after too. I couldn’t take my eyes off him. Did a hundred little things to let him know I was thinking of him, to get him to notice me—cooked his favorite roast, wore green, played Harry Nilsson—and I’d never seen you do anything to catch Leonard’s eye. Had never once seen you and Leonard look at each other the way Rags and I did.”</p>
<p>Beth was quiet. Henry was right. He’d never once looked at her in any way but as a friend. He’d rejected her with indifference. Beth pulled her hat farther down on her head and considered telling Henry about wearing her hair up.</p>
<p>“Did you?” asked Henry.</p>
<p>“Did I what?”</p>
<p>“Did you two ever look at each other like that?”</p>
<p>“He only had eyes for you.”</p>
<p>“Ha. He only had eyes for the farm.”</p>
<p>Beth nodded, jigged. “It was a thing I liked in him. The way he didn’t care what others thought.”</p>
<p>Henry fiddled with the reel’s handle. Spun it back and forth. Had stopped jigging.</p>
<p>Beth said to the ice, “It reminded me of you.” She added, quietly, “Of the way you used to be.”</p>
<p>Henry cocked her head, turned and ran her eyes over Beth’s face. “So I’m the reason you wanted to have sex with my husband?”</p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">It was Henry who had convinced Beth’s parents to let them build the ice boat in the back of the pole barn. Maybe because of the scholarship for some of their materials, Beth’s parents let the girls work on the boat, regardless of chores and homework. They poured over plans, ordered the sail, picked out sheets of ash wood in Alexandria, and finagled cleats and blocks from Washed Up Marina.<b> </b>Henry’s mom got them old hockey skates to have grounded down for runners. Bloom’s Hardware donated bolts, lag-screws, screw-eyes, wire nails, and spikes. One of the other competitor’s dad did the mill work for them. Beth’s father even got a salvaged Ford steering rod from one of his buddies. Absorbed in the work, Beth would catch Henry chewing the inside of her cheek. When she did, Beth flicked her hand to get her to stop. But sometimes, both of them so lost in the work, Henry caused her cheeks to bleed, and she couldn’t eat spaghetti or drink orange juice until they healed.</p>
<p>The girls sawed, glued, bolted, screwed, nailed until they had the tiller, hull, mast, and runners—until they built a simple but sleek ice boat.</p>
<p>Race day: the boys—loud, shoving—didn’t look at Beth or Henry before the event started. The girls took third because they finished. Three other boats didn’t: hull sideboards cracked, guy wires snapped, masts broke. The cracking of wood far louder than the ice’s thundering popping, though even the ice noisier than usual since nearly the whole small lake had been plowed free of snow. That day, the wind stronger than forecasted, it should have been Beth to sail the boat, her extra size and weight could have helped through the tacking and jibing. Standing on the ice, toes numb, snot frozen, voice hoarse with yelling, she willed the boat across the finish line: choked up on the sail’s imaginary rope around her arm, pined for the wind’s tug and pull. They might have taken second, maybe even won.</p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">Beth left the Humdinger, checked the tip ups’ flags, peed on the lee side of the portable, and came back with two more beers from the case in the snow. She was chilled all the way through, her previous sweat damp and cold against her.</p>
<p>In the Humdinger Henry said, “Let’s get out of here.”</p>
<p>Beth nodded. They reeled in their minnows. Both were still alive, untouched, eyes bulging. Wordlessly, the women threw the minnows into the holes and turned off the heater. Beth pulled the tip-ups while Henry broke down the ice house.</p>
<p>Beth had caught them a couple of times. Maybe that was their plan—to get caught so it would be over. Then it would be too late for explanations: they’d get what they wanted. But Henry and Rags had to be found out by someone who didn’t know: Leonard, Diane, one of the kids.</p>
<p>At the annual July Fourth picnic at Henry and Leonard’s, Beth had arrived early. She wanted to help with the final preparations because Henry’d been sick that year—a head cold that had gone to her chest. Maybe it was the oscillating fan on the kitchen counter that kept them from hearing her car on the driveway’s gravel, her opening and closing of the screen door, her shuffling of bags loaded down with potato salad, chips, beer, and fireworks.</p>
<p>The vinegar smell of Henry’s homemade barbeque sauce stung her eyes as Beth walked into the kitchen and saw Rags’ hand on Henry’s hip. They stood close, foreheads nearly touching, whispering. Henry saw Beth first, and flawlessly, immediately, she said to Rags, “You’re right. There’s a thread there,” and moved her hand to where his had been, her two fingers plucking an imaginary bit of nothing from her waist. Rags blushed, coughed a hello to Beth, and said he had to go buy ice for the coolers.</p>
<p>In the oscillating fan’s air—blazing humidity then suffocating whirlwind—Beth thought her sacks of groceries would bring her to the floor as Henry smiled at her, nearly winked. Beth wore the sweat of the kitchen; her mouth watered as if she might puke. But Henry took the beer from her and thanked her for the casserole she’d brought earlier in the week and never once said why or how she could lie straight to Beth’s face even though there’d been no reason to: she’d told Beth about Rags since the beginning.</p>
<p>Before the Moratorium, Beth hoped for Diane’s death—quick and painless. She didn’t dislike Rags’ wife—Beth had attended enough Thanksgiving and Easter dinners to know Diane was a kind woman, a bit dull—wearing a different cat sweatshirt for every event—but kind. Beth couldn’t keep herself from the indulgence of made up newspaper headlines: <i>Diane Brasselman, 46, Killed by 18-wheeler </i>or <i>Brasselman, 49, Mother of Three, Dead After Aneurism</i>. Beth was sure Henry would convince Rags they should be together and then Beth could have Leonard. She would help on the farm without bitching, would probably lose the weight she couldn’t shrug since Leonard didn’t care about food. They could sit by the wood fire. Leonard liked his brandy, and maybe he’d teach her to do the same.</p>
<p>In the first raw months following Leonard’s death, as spring emerged and everything seemed to pair off, Beth had been angry at Leonard. She hadn’t even gotten to say goodbye. She’d expected he would outlive Henry, who’d had a bum knee forever, had suffered something undiagnosed that Beth was sure was a mini stroke, and whose parents died before her own and before Leonard’s. Then, Beth had thought there’d be some kind of fairness in the end. Some kind of lasting love for her too.</p>
<p>In the twilight Beth and Henry shoved the last of the gear into the Wrangler, and the women sat in the jeep, waiting for it to warm up enough to turn the heater on full. They rolled their windows down two inches, though it was probably impossible to go through the ice this late in winter. They sniffled, wiped their noses, and applied Chapstick.  Henry said, “Sir Wildgin’s taking his sweet time tonight.”</p>
<p>In the distance, someone on a ladder plugged in a floodlight above the children still at the rink. The light hung from a tree, casting an old-fashioned aura about the skaters. Beth imagined them cheering the light, though she couldn’t hear so far away. They looked like a muted Rockwell painting.</p>
<p>“That was why you left?” asked Henry. “Since Rags wouldn’t have me? No chance you’d get Leonard?”</p>
<p>Beth stared out the window at the gray, the snow racing on a blast of wind, and the tree line along the lakeshore a darker gray than anything else, except for the white haze of light at the rink. The forced intimacy of the Jeep—safe in the oncoming heat, just the two of them against the world—felt all wrong. “No.” She had hoped it wouldn’t go this far, had hoped Henry wouldn’t be hurt so there wouldn’t be all these questions, had almost hoped Henry had known so Beth wouldn’t have to lie. “I convinced you to tell Rags you loved him.” Beth watched Henry flip her jacket’s zipper, her lips smashed together, her jaw gnawing at the inside of her cheeks. This had been a very bad idea.</p>
<p>“So you could…” Henry’s voice trailed off, waiting for Beth.</p>
<p>Beth reached to turn the heater up.</p>
<p>“You said you were sick of seeing me so unhappy,” said Henry.</p>
<p>“I was.”</p>
<p>“But you wanted my Leonard for yourself.”</p>
<p>Beth dropped her voice, faced Henry. “Your Leonard? How many times did you tell me how lovesick you were? How many times did I hear the wrong brother saga?”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t mean you can love my husband.” Henry’s lips regained the blue-pink she’d crushed out of them. A few wisps of hair blew in the heater’s breath around the edge of her hat.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t mean you can love your husband’s brother.”</p>
<p>They said nothing, the heat blasting, blood pushing to numbed toes and fingers.</p>
<p>Beth wondered if Leonard asked for her during the Moratorium. If he ever even noticed she wasn’t around for dinner or to help with the butchering, the hay. That was probably it, missed as an extra pair of hands. Probably cursed for it. Maybe, in the end, forgotten.</p>
<p>“So you saw I wasn’t going to leave Leonard, and you didn’t have the balls to approach him.” Henry redirected the heater vents. “God knows he didn’t.” Another beat, then, “Why did you tell me?”</p>
<p>Beth shook her head, then blew a breath threw her tight lips. “I thought it would help.”</p>
<p>“Did it? Do you feel better?”</p>
<p>“Not me. You.”</p>
<p>“You’re too selfish for marriage.”</p>
<p>“Probably.”</p>
<p>The heater chugged, and Beth could smell the cold on their coats. She blew her nose and turned on the radio, but the choices were two pop country songs, a Ford truck commercial, and some Grateful Dead song Henry hated. Beth clicked the radio back off.</p>
<p>Beth used to imagine living in the farmhouse with Leonard—Henry and Rags run off somewhere upstate, someday to return so the four of them could sit over drinks and laugh about how well things turned out. At the farm with Leonard, it would be serene, content. Maybe some days she would get mad like Henry did that he never washed the dishes, that he spent his free time in the basement. But maybe if he was living with Beth he would want to be with her during his free time. If nothing else, she’d have what Henry didn’t complain about, a warm body next to her if she woke up from a nightmare, a person to sit across from while drinking coffee, someone to buy her medicine when she was sick. The littleness of what she wanted could make her bones ache if she let it.</p>
<p>“I thought you should know because, before, when you were so sad about Leonard—”</p>
<p>“—Don’t say his name. It’s my name to say.”</p>
<p>Beth bit her lip, tried to bite hard enough to taste blood. “When you were so sad about your husband, I thought it would help if you knew how much I missed him too. Thought we could divide up the sadness and get over it together.” She bit her lip again, and with her incisors she pinched away a small piece of tissue from her bottom lip. It tore like toilet paper, the cheap stuff at the Muni.</p>
<p>Splitting the grief was bullshit. Beth could see it now, see in herself what she wanted to hide, drop to the bottom of the lake. Again her skin flushed hot from her sternum to her hair. She closed her eyes and saw the headlines she’d made for Henry: <i>Henrietta Brasselman, Dead at 52 After Stroke </i>or when she was angriest, <i>Henrietta Brasselman Shot by Unknown Intruder.</i></p>
<p>She wanted to hurt Henry, make her feel the tiniest sliver of what she’d been left with when she couldn’t have Leonard, couldn’t have Henry, couldn’t have anything at all. There was never any real danger Henry wouldn’t keep Beth at her side, only Beth could have called the Moratorium. <i>Henry is weak for me.</i> To have this one thing. No brothers, no husband, no love but that of a transplanted farm girl.</p>
<p>Beth breathed in the tinny air of the Wrangler, watched their humid breath collect on the windshield. Her heart cleaved.</p>
<p>She put the Jeep in first, shifted to second, and drove slowly. She watched the ice houses in the rearview mirror, swallowed back her new guilt, stinging worse than the old.</p>
<p>“Stop. I want to watch them,” said Henry.</p>
<p>Just two hundred yards from the slope where Beth would have to gun Sir Wildgin to get over the hump and back onto the pavement, a hundred yards from the ice dams that lined themselves up like a mountain range, she pulled to the edge of the ice road in one of the many places blown free of snow. The heat blasted its dry, chemical smell at them. She clicked her headlights off, and again the rink was lit by the single flood light strung up in a tree on the bank.</p>
<p>For several minutes, they watched and neither of them said a word, just listened to the gusting heat and under that, the occasional cycling of the engine. The snow swirled, but it had let up a bit, and as it grew darker, the wind ebbed. Every once in a while, through the cracked windows, a shout or laughter came from the children on the ice.</p>
<p>Beth still recalled sailing the ice boat: lying down in the hull so the boom wouldn’t hit her, one hand on the tiller, the other wrapped with the sheet’s rope. A slow gathering of momentum, then a sprint as she trimmed the sail. She yanked her hat off with her roped hand, the wind’s fingers teasing her hair. Choking up on the rope: flying. Shushing blades, hurling wind. Trimming the sail, wind tugging back on her roped arm: a kind of push-pull embrace. Just the way she’d known love to be—get closer, pull back, close in, release. A sailor always had to tack, watch for pressure ridges and open water.</p>
<p>In the Wrangler, Beth pulled off her hat, and Henry did the same. The smell of Henry’s dryer sheets wafted in the Jeep. Through the windshield, from the original gang, only two boys and two girls, similar in age, siblings or friends, worked without words on a project they’d obviously done many times before. Their fire burned in a metal pit nearby. The pump, operated by a fatherish man, flooded water onto the ice. The kids spread the water with wide blade snow shovels. One of them used a towel fixed lengthwise to a board nailed to an old broom handle. Steam rose in heavy sheets from the lake water, warmer than the night. It shrouded all of them in a fine haze, a gentle blurr. As if real life could exist as it did through the Humdinger’s window.</p>
<p>Henry asked, “What do you think he wanted?”</p>
<p>Beth turned the windshield wipers to intermittent so they could watch. She could see now it wasn’t such a bad night for rink building if they kept at it, the lake water they were pumping up would melt the snow for a while. “He wanted you. I see it now.” She squinted at the boy throwing a couple more logs on the fire. “I’m sorry he’s gone, but I’m damn glad to have you back.”</p>
<p>Beth held her hands in front of the blowers, wiggled her stinging toes. Through the windows, laughter. She dropped the heat one level and heard the snowmobilers before she saw them. The engine cycled and laughter from the rink split through the crack in the windows.</p>
<p>Henry said, “Let’s go to the Muni.”</p>
<p>“They’ll ask us how we did out here.”</p>
<p>“We’ll ignore them.”</p>
<p>Beth had the better love. She doubted Leonard would have ever seen her the way Henry did now, again.</p>
<p>They watched the skaters and listened to the wind throw ice crystals against the jeep. The ice, blown clear of snow, reflected the distant spotlight. The heat still blasted. Beth pulled her fingers through her hair. The static sounded like fireworks.</p>
<p>Beth took a last look at the kids on skates. The steam rose around them, and the light, filtered through the falling snow, made them look other worldly, made them appear as if they were in slow motion. She smelled their fire and Henry’s dryer sheets. She wanted to tell Henry: look at that rink. Those kids doing this beautiful thing. Making something out of nothing. Instead of sitting. Instead of just trying to take something and not even able to do that.</p>
<p>Henry hit the gas. At the same time, she held the buttons to roll both front windows down all the way. The ice was clear, just as if a track had been plowed. Only the pressure ridge that looped around the shore would stop them. She was up to thirty miles per hour, the pedal still jammed to the floor. The engine whined, and she shifted to third, peaked at Henry, who clutched the middle console and the oh-shit bar on the door. Her eyes were wide, hair wild with static.</p>
<p>“Beth!”</p>
<p>“Henry!”</p>
<p>“Do it!” yelled Henry.</p>
<p>At forty-five miles per hour, Beth jammed the brakes, and the Jeep did a long slide. Then a tire caught, and they looped, tight and fast. Everything slowed—like the car accident when she broke her leg, like the call from Henry to say Leonard was dead. The centrifugal force glued her head to the neck rest. Out the windshield the dark lake swooped. Another tire caught, and for a moment it felt like they lifted off one side. They righted, and she turned her neck, body pressed to the seat, her belly woozy with the turning. At the sight of Henry—eyes shining, smile swabbed across her cheeks—a lump formed in Beth’s throat and the wooziness vanished. Beth wanted to woop, but a tire caught again, and again they shushed a huge circle in the ice, grays unspooling before her, uncoiling, out the window a filmstrip breaking. Wind raced in her hair. They looped again: sailing.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Willy gone with his knife to open birds or clean fish, practice<br />
lifting rows of bones out of caught bodies.  Up at the house old china-head<br />
Beulah, Aunt Ruby’s doll, watches from her shelf beside the glass<br />
pistol that once was Uncle Ralph’s toy, its round dead</p>
<p>candies still fading inside.  Annie’s stitches are snaggy, but they’ve followed<br />
Aunt Ruby’s sampler design; Lila’s only changed the maxim.  Tilly in the corner asking not<br />
one question till Lila complains she’s using up all the blue thread:  So?  &#8211;A tumbleweed<br />
sprouting a ladder to somewhere is her answer when Aunt Ruby demands <i>what</i></p>
<p><i>pattern is that?  What’s it supposed to teach?  &#8211;Got to make a real picture, Hon-oh,<br />
</i><i>a house with a garden, for heaven’s sake!  </i>A purple rose then, exploding from a house<br />
that rides choppy waves of letters spelling SOMEWHERE.  <i>Somewhere, over the rainbow<br />
</i>sings Lila as finally light fades and a breeze raises each face</p>
<p>to the window.  Deer at the shelterbelt’s edge, lifting heads as the swallows wheel,<br />
then one deer ripples up through the grain, the others following, into the field.</p>

<p>And the neighbor’s daughter shows my son<br />
the way her father let her hold his gun,</p>
<p>with bullets in it.  She was on Adderall,<br />
and now Ritalin, and they’re only in</p>
<p>Kindergarten but my son doesn’t much<br />
like her—the way she brags and lies</p>
<p>and tries to destroy the plants or bugs<br />
around our house, which is the bus stop,</p>
<p>so we head out each morning in our<br />
pajamas, clutching coffee mugs, to wait.</p>
<p>The engine of the bus is huffing,<br />
unmistakable, and we can all hear it</p>
<p>before its yellow nose comes around<br />
the bend.  The kids climb the high steps</p>
<p>like they’re scaling a great peak.<br />
I can see my son fling his body</p>
<p>into a seat; he waves from the window<br />
while Sarah makes her way to her</p>
<p>mandated spot behind the driver,<br />
who waves to us too, then pulls the lever</p>
<p>to shut the doors and heads down Heartwood<br />
Crossing, though the sign says Xing</p>
<p>as the whole name won’t fit.  This cross-<br />
hatch, this target; X marks the spot</p>
<p>like those yellow and black novelty<br />
signs:  Moose Xing, Gator Xing,</p>
<p>Sasquatch Xing.  my son loves to watch<br />
the show Finding Bigfoot, where</p>
<p>a research team goes to Rhode Island,<br />
Alaska, New York, to investigate</p>
<p>a recent spike in Squatch sightings.<br />
Each episode is exactly the same,</p>
<p>save for the location:  they go out<br />
as a team one night to look for bigfoot,</p>
<p>call for him, and find signs.  Next,<br />
they have a town hall meeting</p>
<p>to discuss sightings with residents<br />
who tell stories, which they recreate</p>
<p>using a giant guy named Bobo as a stand-in,<br />
and they always come to the conclusion</p>
<p>that the resident did see a bigfoot—<br />
that bigfoot could definitely live in</p>
<p>____________.  We live in blank.<br />
Sarah’s mother threw her father out</p>
<p>for keeping a loaded Uzi on the floor<br />
of their garage.  When Sarah aims,</p>
<p>with her fingers, at the empty birds’ nests<br />
in the eaves of our porch, I wait for her</p>
<p>to say bang, but instead she repeats<br />
<i>it had bullets in it</i>, and there’s the bus</p>
<p>wheezing around the bend again,<br />
yellow as a road sign, a daffodil,</p>
<p>a stretch of CAUTION tape.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">—<i>for Dad</i></p>
<p>Salvatore learns English from the movies<br />
where Charlton Heston holds the writhing<br />
Anne Baxter, a white actress made-up to look Egyptian<br />
and tragic. When she pulls away it means <i>hold me closer,</i></p>
<p><i></i><i>I don’t care</i> <i>if I’m caught</i>.  Sal’s mother hides<br />
in the subway to spy on the 6 o’clock train,<br />
her husband parting the crowd with his Heston chin.<br />
She says it’s her fault she married</p>
<p>a Northern Italian—blond and light skinned,<br />
a mouth full of straight teeth. She cuts<br />
the eggplant without looking, whole garlic cloves<br />
and basil; serves everyone before she serves herself.</p>
<p>Below their apartment the same old<br />
drunk starts to rant about his whore of a wife.<br />
Sal’s mother clears the plates with a look he will inherit<br />
and pass down—a creased brow un-creasing</p>
<p>with relief, when life is bad but not as bad<br />
as it could be. Curses barge through their window<br />
mixing with the voice of Moses, as the desperate<br />
drag everything they’ve got across the parted sea.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I didn’t believe him for the longest time. Three years since Mama’s passing, and he continued to see her. Day before the sale, I heard him scramble into his pants and flannel, laces criss-crossing, light still murky uncertain. I knew he’d caught sight of something from his bedroom window. I pulled on socks, back door swung wide. I followed him, imagined Mama’s words in my ears <i>Look after your father</i>, as if she’d known, as if somehow she’d known.</p>
<p>Outside Daddy’s boots broke dirt clots, the little land we had left went on unplowed, just stubs of corn, old mud ruts now dry. Didn’t want me to follow him. Tess! He called, my mother’s name. How had he gotten so far? Face sweat shined when I caught up to him<b>;</b> I tugged his elbow. Let’s go home, I told him, shivering with chill despite the wet heat. He took off. I heard emptiness rattle inside his shirt. He refused to eat. Said nothing tasted right. I looked up in the direction he ran, saw a woman in a grey gown and overcoat. She plodded firm. Her back to us. Tess, he said to her, please. I didn’t want what he claimed to be true. Had stood beneath the old oak, the one stone with two engraved names. Thought I remembered crying.</p>
<p>I reached him again. He put a hand up to silence me. The sky peached, moon receded. We followed her across the colorless grass and into the trees. Briars caught on the length of her gown. Glare on the river, everything lifting with fire, a new day. We came up on her. He reached a hand out to her shoulder to turn her, and she looked at us—a stranger, eyes wild and unfocused. She shoved Daddy. No weight to hold him steady—and he flew, backside hitting a maple we sometimes tapped. She kept on, Daddy dazed, egg-like lump rising on the back of his head—Tess? His face sheened white.</p>
<p>She’s dead, I reminded him.</p>
<p>Luann, your mama’s never gonna forgive me, he said, rubbing the bruise. We watched the woman descend into the river furrow, move along the dry bank.</p>
<p>That night he sat on the edge of my bed, told me that was no woman but a ghost, said ghosts were everywhere and they were nothing to fear. Your mama’s the one I’m waiting for. Bound to come back to give me her mind, losing her people’s land like this. Tried to tell him there’s no such thing as ghosts, but he gave me a hollow look, like I had no real thought in my head. I was scared and after he left I cried, covered my head with blankets. Truth be told, if she were upset with anyone it would be me. After a bit I tried to concentrate on summer sounds: peepers and gassy toads. I listened for her footsteps. Stiffened in my iron bed. Counted my breaths. Mama? It could have been ten minutes, an hour that passed when I lifted the blankets, blinked into darkness.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Mrs. Sparkman arrives early with two women from church. They set up the tables. Talk about the new priest, the upcoming pancake breakfast, the heat. They set out buckets of ice and jugs of sun tea. I bring stuff from inside the house and set it on the tables. Old clothes, the little jewelry she had. Dishes and kitchen things. A couple stained dolls. Daddy’s in the barn with the men. As we work the women ask me questions out the sides of their mouths. I am eight now. Do I like to swim? You must get lonely out here, no playmates your own age. They click their tongues. Wear looks of pity. I twirl with my arms up, white dress swirling, curls jostling to my shoulders, then stop. One hand chews up fabric in a fist. They applaud; say I am cute. And then I head back inside, don’t want them to think I can’t earn my keep.</p>
<p>Gonna be trouble later. <b>Nobody knows her people.</b></p>
<p>Hush now. Girl’s right there.</p>
<p>Mark my words.</p>
<p>More people arrive. Plastic bags hold purchases. The cash box fills. Everyone buys bits of us until only remnants are left—mismatched socks, an egg timer that doesn’t work. I hold Daddy’s hand when the auctioneer clears his throat, waves a hand in attention. The driest year Daddy can remember. July isn’t even over and the trees have already dropped their leaves. Tassels on the corn dry frittered things. Had to give up all the cows. Nothing for pasture. Nothing to pay for feed. River smells of mud, decaying fish. Vultures spoon the sky.</p>
<p>Daddy’s not the only guy Papermill laid off, he’s just the unluckiest, he says. The buckets of ice have turned to water by the time they are done. Some shake Daddy’s hand, squeeze his shoulder. Take care, now, they say. We sit on the steps and watch the train of cars leave land that has been in my mother’s family for three generations—land the bank has sold. Dust whorls. We sweat. There is no breeze.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Two days he stays in bed. Ripe with fever, sweating. I sit beside him in a chair. Hold cool cloths to his forehead. Read aloud from books I have. Sadness seeps out of him. When he sleeps, he whimpers about the land, eyes half-lidded and dancing. Daddy, wake up. It’s a dream. You are dreaming. I clap my hands around his. Callused and feathered with hairs. He blinks awake, stares. I love you, Daddy, I tell him. I count to one hundred and back down. Fan whirs in its place on the dresser top, the faintest air moving.</p>
<p>I do what I imagine Mama doing. Wipe the counters with a mixture of vinegar and water, use an old fly swatter to beat dust from the curtains. Hang laundry on the line out back. Daddy is not whole and needs nutrition, so I make a bowl of oatmeal, stir in the last bit of brown sugar. Sit at his bedside. Try to rouse him. Time to eat, Daddy. Gotta keep up your strength. But he pays me no mind and I know he is dreaming about her, that together he and Mama are making a plan. I try to push it out but cannot forget that I am not of them. At what point will I be sold, given away?</p>
<p>That night, I can’t sleep. Am afraid of what may appear if I close my eyes. Instead I wander the house, rooms empty. I go to his bedroom and stand in the doorway. Stroke his arm to make him wake. Tess? he asks.</p>
<p>It’s me, Luann. Your daughter.</p>
<p>What do you want? I don’t say anything and he scoots over. I situate myself right alongside him. The up and down of his chest and my chest. My fears evaporate. Promise I’ll just close my eyes for a moment. Then it’s morning and I wake alone. All that heat. Birds chirping, sheet pushed back, bedclothes damp and empty. Daddy? I move through rooms vacant of furniture, rugs, just a dull echo. Heart bamming away with all the silence, leaves outside sway with their crispness. Everything burned up, dying.</p>
<p>I find him toeing the ledge of the barn, that open space on the second floor that leads to nothing—bits of hay, mouse droppings. Daddy, stay there. I’m coming up. Feet sooty, eyes dancing. I scurry up the rungs. Stand behind him, smell his sourness.</p>
<p>I’m not right, he says.</p>
<p>It’s not you, it’s times, I say, and inch closer.</p>
<p>I was the one who planted that baby inside her, he says. His hair stands wild; I feel how close he is to the edge.</p>
<p>She says she misses me. Never used to say things like that. He drops his chin and I grab his middle, yank him back until he collapses on top of me, the floor holding us. We both shake, dust in my nostrils, it burns my eyes. Sun all bared and his sobbing up against me, his back to my front. Air sputters out of him in choked bits. I hold him like this for some time, tight as I am able, wish Mama would appear.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>They are building houses west of town on land that once belonged to the Doreghtys and Ryans. River’s Crossing is what the sign says. We pack a lunch and sit in the shadow of a hickory. Apples dipped in peanut butter—food the church people leave on the step. You gotta eat something, I tell him, just like I imagine her saying. I know, he says, palming a whole apple.</p>
<p>We sit so long waiting for Mama that my backside begins to tingle. She’s different now, he says. Ingleside is different, too. The deer thin and sickly looking. Smallmouth bass used to leap into a net extended from Red Arrow Bridge, now they are pale scrawny things that barely ribbon the water; Daddy refuses to eat them. The bridge is near Papermill and Daddy won’t go near that side of town.</p>
<p>The bulldozers gnash the ground, drop black soil in mounds; the earth clean smelling, rich looking, but the top layer blows away—dust coats our eyes, lines the insides of our fingers and toes. The houses have long peaked roofs and attached garages. Doors tall enough to let in giants. Tiny octagonal signs advertise security systems. The workmen hammer and drill, their backs bare and tanned. We wait until the last crew drives off and then I follow him down to where the blacktop ends and the for-sale signs disappear. We head in a ways past drought-stricken trees to the crumbling brick of a hearth. Can see where the foundation stood—cinderblocks streaked black. The frame of a door and two windows beside that. He moves through the area, boots catch on reams of honeysuckle, crush weeds. He keeps walking around as if he’s trying to decide something. Stops. They think you would be better off elsewhere. Living with someone else….his voice trails off. Won’t look at me. He opens and closes his hands. Palms his neck, the side of his face that still doesn’t look right—skin bumpy and disjointed.</p>
<p>I squint up at him. He starts walking again. A breeze curdles up from somewhere else. Dries the sweat on my neck where my hair is pulled back. I feel like crying. When he keeps to his silence I go and grab him. Hold him by the pant loops. I want to stay with you, I say. Watch the crazy panning of his eyes. He’s here but not here. He lifts his arms a bit, does a half spin, gestures, and I turn with him. He talks. This used to be the kitchen. Right here. My mother and father. The twins sat on either side of mother. My brothers. He’s stroking his neck again, the warpled skin, and I know he smells the smoke, feels everything crashing and ripping down around him, and then the fire streaming from him. He runs a hand on the brick. Rubs it back and forth like the tracings we’ve made at school, only he’s pressing down with his wrist, and the skin’s getting all scraped up and dotted with red.</p>
<p>As he talks, pictures begin to appear in my mind and I wonder if this is what it’s like to see things. To be ghost haunted just like him. He points to the brush, to nothingness. I try to force the image of his dead family. I want to be more like him except in this way.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The first time he saw a ghost he was just a boy, out hunting pheasant with his brother and father. His mother was at home preparing the dressing. He held the gun in front of him, one hand on the stock, the other the barrel. He was a careful boy, a boy who wanted to please; he saw a flock of birds, aimed but the birds scattered before he could fire—hot heat poured from his arm, and he fell over at the sight of his blood spilling out onto the grass. His younger brother unaware of his misplaced shot. Too frightened yet to scream, little flap of skin on his arm, white flash of bone beneath. And then a man slipped out from the trees, a big man, dark hoodless eyes, skin as brown as deer hide. He snuck out, seemed to appear from the tall grass. The man passed a hand over my daddy’s arm and the blood dried up, went away altogether. The seam that had ripped open his arm disappeared. His skin again whole. Just a few stains on the grass to let him know it had occurred. By the time his brother found him, the man had evaporated into the trees.</p>
<p>He told his father he thought he saw Jesus. Son, he said, you must pray that happens in your lifetime.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Once the bank took down the sign from out front, the papers for the new owners filed, <b>Mama</b> came more frequently. I heard my daddy at the kitchen table with his checkbook and the security box late into the night, and then the chair would push back suddenly and he’d up and leave. I learned to sleep lightly, to keep my sneakers tied. I’d keep a thermos of water near the door, would grab it on the way out. Never knew how long it would take, where he would go. Sometimes he wanted to be left alone—turned the handle as he closed the door soft and careful, and then I’d hear his boots thwaping the ground, and he’d be off. I followed his slim shape, pumped my arms to keep up. His chest heaved, a comfort to me. I followed him across a rise into trees, then over a low wooden bridge, the river still beneath us. Tess! He cried, voice mournful. I did not see anything but his slight shape, the river’s decay heavy and rich. He pointed out her shape in the movement of some shrubs. I stared long and hard and still she did not appear. But I’d watch with him, and the longer we sat the more ghosts he saw: black people ragged and knobby kneed, faces clenched as they clamored the ground, crouched like animals amid brambles and dead leaves as they headed further north. One time I stood there beside my father as he said a whole troop of them trudged in tattered clothes, faces worn. Twenty, thirty of them. A baby cried and a woman lifted the child to her breast. We stood there and that time I did feel cool air moving. Had always knows the route to the Underground Railroad cut right through these parts, my mama’s people offered food, shelter. But I didn’t see a thing.</p>
<p>The woman with the child held her out to Daddy and he turned away, grabbed my shoulder, told me to start walking and fast. It’s one thing to see them, he said. Another thing altogether when they start seeing you.</p>
<p>And then nothing is as it seems. I find the skull of a squirrel, poke it with a stick, but then I see it whole, running along the underbrush, up a tree.</p>
<p>What is real, what is imagined?</p>
<p>He tells me how the land was different before they adopted me, how he planted acres of corn and soybeans—more than<b> seventy beef cattle</b>. Used to make enough to attend the movies on Saturday nights, a nice ham and turkey at Christmastime.</p>
<p>We sit on the porch. Watch the sun beat the scabbed grasses, what by now should have been corn throwing shadows on our legs, leaves brushing up against each other in a soft whisper. He tells a story for every plot—points out where he first glimpsed my mother from behind a milking pail, the hill where he shot a buck; over there is where he says I took my first steps. You need to remember this, he says. I won’t always be here. Where are you going, I ask, but he does not answer.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Our last night and the house is empty. I make Daddy drive me to Welmann’s where I use all our coupons on butter and sour cream, potatoes, eggs, ground beef. I make him dinner. Meatloaf with mashed potatoes pooling with gravy, buttered carrots in a glossy sheen. Now you eat, I say, one hand on hip. My best mama pose. I watch him touch the food on the chipped plate; the fork tines leave a ribbed impression, gravy floods from his potatoes. But he won’t eat. His eyes have already started to pop from his face, excavating the bones on his cheeks. This worries me. All the fears climbing on top of each other. I finish my glass of milk, wipe my mouth and stand. I have already fixed quarters to the bottom of my shoes, tap in a little circle on the linoleum, finish with my arms up, ta-dah! He claps a few hands, says that is real nice, although he doesn’t mean it. His eyes seemed to brighten. Yes, yes, he says, nodding. Yes, she is.</p>
<p>Who you speaking to? I ask.</p>
<p>He chuckles, stubble on his beard flecked with white. It’s your mama.</p>
<p>I don’t see her.</p>
<p>She’s right over there. I walk in the direction he points, push my face in the corner of the room. Mama! It’s Luann. You talk to me right now, and I stomp.</p>
<p>Don’t take that tone with her, he says. She’s still your mama.</p>
<p>Show yourself! I demand. Begin to think maybe Daddy really is crazy because there’s no one here but us.</p>
<p>We unroll blankets on the living room floor but it is too hot to even blink. Moths flick against the light outside the barn and I wonder about the land. We aren’t the only ones bought out by developers. Somehow I doze. Wake to buzzing, the click of the latch. Daddy?</p>
<p>Can hear him shuffling away in his boots. Slide on my sneakers. He hasn’t gotten far. Once I fall into step behind him he begins to run and I follow him. Daddy! Wait! I have a four-leaf clover pressed between sheets of waxed paper, the Bible from Mama’s family. A bit of hair I cut from her when she was pregnant and napping and not yet dead. But I doubt any of this will work. Please stop!</p>
<p>He runs until he arrives downtown a good two miles from our house. Both of us sweaty and breathless when he slows in front of the ice cream parlor. He visors his hands around his eyes, presses his face into the glass. She’s fixing something, he says, <b>sweat puddles</b> the back of his shirt and at his armpits. I look through the window. See the counter with its striped stools. Booths with napkin dispensers. I don’t see anybody. Why won’t she show herself to me?</p>
<p>It’s hot fudge, he says. Yow-wee. Extra cherries, Tess! You know it.</p>
<p>Behind us the sign for Bremeyer’s Department Store glows red. Beside it for-sale signs and realtors, all those panes of glass swallow his sound, send it right back up at us. Hey! he says, brows drawn, mouth tightening. This way.</p>
<p>I tug his elbow. Let’s go back. Rush my mind to get him to turn around, head home. The animals are gone. Land sold. We should go back, I say.</p>
<p>Don’t you want ice cream, Luann? He put a hand around my shoulder as he says this, looks right into my face as he speaks. Your mama is right there, and she’s making us a treat. I look into the shop. Want to see something. Memories of my mother have evaporated to a kind of blurred uncertainty. Tess! He rattles the door handle. Let me in. His voice skims across empty storefronts, the two storey brick buildings. He picks up a cement ashtray parked next to a bench, heaves it up, veins in his neck popping. Daddy, I say, stepping forward, don’t do something you’re going to regret. He elbows me away and in one movement swings the ashtray through the door; glass shatters, a bell goes off, surprising us both.</p>
<p>He charges into the parlor, heels crunching and skidding on glass. Tess? His arm bloody. The alarm won’t quit.</p>
<p>Daddy, I say, Let’s go. He is behind the counter now palming the space. Lights flash red and blue, a siren. His blood pinks the smoothness.</p>
<p>She was right here. I saw her. He starts opening and closing the cabinets. Looking behind closet doors.</p>
<p>We’ve got to go. She’s not here. And while I know he hasn’t forgotten, know it pains to hear it, I remind him. She’s in the ground on the hill. The sheriff comes in then. What’s all this about, Teensy? he asks my daddy, and I feel the familiar pride as he steps forward, takes Daddy’s hand. Sometimes they hunt together.  Once delivered a calf for the sheriff’s son and his wife. Everybody likes Daddy.</p>
<p>Daddy shakes his head, offers a half shrug. The sheriff presses paper napkins to the wound. It’s hard times, is what Daddy says.</p>
<p>That it is, says the sheriff. Don’t need to take it out on private property, you hear? He claps both hands on Daddy’s shoulders and shakes them. You hear me? Gonna have to pay for this, he says. Daddy promises he will and the sheriff offers us a ride in his car. I let myself in the backseat. Daddy’s in front.</p>
<p>People are starting to talk, Teensy, he says, turns on the air conditioning, and the first icy blasts change my skin to plastic.</p>
<p>So let them talk.</p>
<p>I mean really talk. You’ve got to get hold of yourself or someone’s gonna do it for you. You got a daughter. He looks at me in the rear mirror, forces a dopey smile. Think of Luann.</p>
<p>You think I don’t know that. You think she’s not on my mind constant? So tired everyone telling me what’s right, what I can and cannot do. You people are killing me. His voice escalates and he’s angry. Let me out, he says, working the door.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Daddy punches the door open and rolls out into the grass. The car jerks to a stop. Insects dart in the beams from the car, that long road stretched before us. The sheriff <b>swings his door ajar</b> and sticks his head out. I could take you in, Teensy. You know that? He follows Daddy in the car, the headlights catching shots of his back or legs as Daddy walks and we all head home.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The next day is like any other. We roll up the blankets and huck them in the back of the truck. The door rattles in its frame as he shuts it, house empty of us. Daddy drives to Grandma’s house, empties boxes from the back of the truck and puts them in the basement. I don’t answer him when he asks me if I’m ready, then turns toward Mrs. Sparkman’s house. Still don’t believe him when he says Grandma can’t care for me. Say the truth, I think. She doesn’t like me. Not of her kind.</p>
<p>He promises that he’ll be back in a week. Tells me to mind my manners. He’s going to Savoy for a few days to see about a job. He sets my bag just inside the door where Mrs. Sparkman tells him to leave it. Her house is warmer than outside and smells of stewed tomatoes. He gives me a hard hug. You be good now, he says.</p>
<p>As his truck pulls away, Mrs. Sparkman waves a handkerchief from the porch, her bosom swelling against the cabbage roses on her housedress. I refuse to look at him. Peer at ground. I hear him turn his truck around in the grass. Dust lifts up. I try to ground my heels in the dirt, but I can’t do it. Don’t want to stay here, am not going be left behind. Mrs. Sparkman calls my name, tells me to come back. Pump my puny arms, and here I run beside the truck. He slouches over the wheel. Won’t look at me. He has the window down, the knob of an elbow out. I’m almost even with him when he gives it gas and shoots forward—and I choke on all that dust, bend over and spit cough, and when I stand up again I see her a ways off in the crest of a hill, my mama’s unmistakable step. Her nightdress is faded but there is a rise in the belly, that almost baby. I see her now. Wave my arms—she’s right here! Daddy, wait!</p>
<p>I believe you, I say, she’s here! His truck keeps on, dust in its wake. Mom! I call, a word I rarely say, and raise a hand. When she doesn’t look up I take off in her direction. She has shown herself to us both. But I will be the one to force her to remain.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><i>Dorchester Neck, 1665<b> </b></i></p>
<p>Bent over a breeched calf, rain<br />
spinning off the placenta, I didn’t see<br />
the waves net the millpond<br />
to cut me off from shore.<br />
The black hound Luther yipped<br />
across the chasm. Lightning smote<br />
the islands. I had not recourse<br />
but to huddle with the herd.<br />
The slick calf quavered.<br />
White gold, His Hand<br />
swooped down the fume and moil<br />
and seized (I later heard)<br />
His servant, Captain Davenport,<br />
standing guard. When I could see<br />
again, despair was all. The fort<br />
across the harbor blazed,<br />
the air acid, tinged with green.<br />
Headlong the Hawk<br />
that plucketh the saint, his eyesockets,<br />
they said, smoking. Unsearchable<br />
is that translation. Then the tide<br />
ebbed, the gale ripped northward.<br />
As the sea parted for me,<br />
an unwitting captain,<br />
the millwheel pulsed and swung.<br />
It did seem to me to beat out<br />
the holy poem Mr. Warham taught me,<br />
“Unto myself, myself, myself…”<br />
But I couldn’t work it out,<br />
how many selves there were<br />
shot under the wheel before the word<br />
“betray” ground to grist for God’s<br />
bread the ‘I’ that once could not believe.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had a neighbor who said she kept a whistle by the telephone. Whenever a telemarketer called, she&#8217;d blow the whistle into the phone&#8217;s receiver. I wasn&#8217;t sure whether this was a terrible or a brilliant idea. Her name was Helen, and for ten years, she lived across the street from me. Helen was a nurse. She worked evenings and some weekends on the cardiology floor of the children&#8217;s hospital. I didn&#8217;t see her often, but when I did, it was usually from my porch. We&#8217;d wave at each other across our lawns, then she&#8217;d say something, but of course I couldn&#8217;t hear her, our voices lost in all that landscaping. Inevitably we&#8217;d get up and walk slowly across the grass, and for a few minutes, standing by our mailboxes, we&#8217;d talk.</p>
<p>Helen&#8217;s stories were mostly about kids with bad hearts, hearts that pumped too fast, or not fast enough, or hard enough, stories where the kids aren&#8217;t necessarily going to get better. I&#8217;m sure there were lots of uplifting stories too, but Helen didn&#8217;t share those stories with me, just the sad ones. As far as I knew, Helen had never married. She lived alone. Boyfriend, maybe, though I never saw him. There were cats, a pair of them. I&#8217;d been inside her house maybe five times in that many years.</p>
<p>&#8220;So whatever happened with the raccoons?&#8221; I asked her one evening. As we stood in the road, the sun seemed to take a deep breath before falling behind the mountains.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen them in a few days,&#8221; Helen said. &#8220;But they&#8217;ll be back.&#8221; She folded her arms over her scrubs. The air had grown colder, and Helen&#8217;s porch light came on.  The row of trees by my driveway looked like motionless giants. I looked past them to my house, two rectangles of  light winking through the leaves, and then I was alone in the dark seclusion of my living room, Friday night, can opener in one hand, TV remote in the other.</p>
<p>It started to rain. Just a whisper on the roof at first, then a steady downpour. I stood up and walked to the window, listening to water rushing from the gutters.</p>
<p>There is one story in particular, the story of a boy with liver disease. He was not under Helen&#8217;s care, but being a friend&#8217;s son, she stopped in frequently to check on him. This boy was very young, only six when he died. Toward the end, his skin grew waxy and began to turn orange, until even his eyes took a yellow tint. I imagine him often, curled up on his hospital bed, sucking on a sheet corner with his sandpaper tongue. That was not a boy, I sometimes think.</p>
<p>The phone rang. It was Helen. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry Mark,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I know it&#8217;s raining. But he&#8217;s back. The big male with the stripe over his eye. Can you come?&#8221;</p>
<p>Of all the things Helen tried&#8211;a cinderblock, a bungee cord over the lid&#8211;the raccoon was one step ahead of her, leaving a trail of garbage down her driveway for her to pick up in the morning.<br />
&#8220;I just don&#8217;t get it,&#8221; Helen said, standing beside me in her kitchen. &#8220;They make such a mess, and I hardly ever hear them.&#8221;</p>
<p>It started with a chicken carcass, the bones found hanging from her shrubs like deranged Christmas ornaments. Then the little wooden owl went missing from her porch, the one holding a set of spare house keys. Soon after, a bag of cat litter left on the porch overnight was split down the middle. &#8220;Quite the mess,&#8221; Helen said.</p>
<p>&#8220;So where is he?&#8221; I asked, looking through the window at her rain-slick driveway.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the thing,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t actually see him this time. I just heard him scratching the garage door. I know he&#8217;s out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen left the kitchen. When she returned, she handed me a towel. My sneakers had made a pool of water on the tile. &#8220;You&#8217;re soaking,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Whatever happened to rain coats?&#8221; There was something about doctors and nurses, the way they moved, and spoke, islands of hope in the middle of all that sadness. I always thought they carried a certain kind of grace.</p>
<p>The boy with the orange skin was always thirsty. Helen brought him ice cubes wrapped in paper towels. The boy used the ice to wet his chapped lips, and then he let the ice melt against his swollen cheeks, and on the puffy crescents under his eyes.  Doctors allowed him cups of water, little six ounce Styrofoam cups that were never enough. The boy&#8217;s eyes flashed around the room, looking for familiar faces, for Helen, maybe, but mostly for his father. Where was his father? His eyes were like marbles, orange and glassy. Doll&#8217;s eyes. His skin seemed to molt, flaking away and falling onto the linoleum.</p>
<p>The rain was coming down hard now. Wind pushed the rain sideways, a flurry of stars sparking under the flood lamp before fading into nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have an idea,&#8221; Helen said. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s the lights. Let&#8217;s turn them off and see if he comes back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what?&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>Helen turned off the porch lamp, followed by the kitchen lights, until it was just us standing in the dark, listening to the rain and the sound of our own breathing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I need to tell you something, Mark,&#8221; Helen said. She paused. The house seemed to sigh under the pressure of the wind.</p>
<p>&#8220;About the raccoon?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who gives a fuck about the raccoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>The thing about the boy is this: it was more than just the story of a boy with a bad liver, a boy who was dying alone in the hospital. It was also the story of the father who was afraid to visit him. Afraid of what, exactly? Afraid of the boy? Of himself?</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I understand now,&#8221; Helen said. &#8220;I thought of you alone in your house and I just needed to tell you that. Not that it makes a difference. But I think I understand why you stopped coming to visit your boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>Helen had said what she needed to say, and now she was quiet.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t just Helen&#8217;s story, though she was a part of it. It was a story about the boy, and it was a story about the father.</p>
<p>I looked outside, but it was just the rain and the wind and the trees swaying in the dark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I turn on the lights now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay,&#8221; Helen said.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>For my grandson</em></p>
<p>&#8220;All wars are boyish, and are fought by boys.&#8221;<br />
&#8212; Herman Melville</p>
<p>Monument by monument we’ve found the site.<br />
You’re wearing an officer’s plumed hat<br />
chosen from shelves of replicas, and</p>
<p>over one shoulder an enlisted man’s haversack<br />
stocked with insignia, a clay pipe, a Minié ball—<br />
a ten-year-old, you’re the whole regiment.</p>
<p>You stretch full length beside a witness oak,<br />
on the sloping, lichen-covered stone<br />
where Mathew Brady’s assistants are lounging</p>
<p>in your book of views of the battlefield now<br />
and on the day after Lee’s retreat. The dead<br />
have already been exposed onto glass plates.</p>
<p>You walk the breastworks, now only a slight<br />
rise in the earth beyond the witness tree.<br />
History’s open in your hands. General Greene</p>
<p>and his 102nd New York made its stand<br />
here, defeating the 15th Louisiana<br />
coming through the woods. Lead poisoning</p>
<p>killed many of the trees, you teach me,<br />
and years after the battle, lightning<br />
would set off unexploded shells.</p>
<p>A school bus stops for a moment<br />
and you wave. Then fall mortally wounded,<br />
having so many postures to choose from.</p>
<p>Waiting for your picket to report back,<br />
you stand beside the oak, ostrich plume stirring<br />
in a light wind from the 2nd of July, 1863,</p>
<p>while a rider on horseback bending low,<br />
chunks of moss flying from hooves,<br />
hurtles fallen trees to reach this ground</p>
<p>where blood has yet to come up monuments.</p>

Oppie&#8217;s porkpie hat shadows his face,<br />

He&#8217;s nervous, tense, afraid that something will<br />

can go wrong.  There is the question of fallout.<br />
He hugs himelf while smoking, arms crossed,<br />
a pose so characteristic, so often noted,<br />
that actors who play him do the same.  The flood<br />

In general, deserts are dry, and men<br />
measuring white sands are a mirage.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Gettysburg, July 1947</i></p>
<p>With my good heels<br />
and summer wools,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a conic slice among trapezoids<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plunged in grass and lapidific ducktails<br />
pushed east-northeast<br />
by cannon blast.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not in tears. Like the wild mint I lap<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against the monuments, breeding, bridling<br />
my green thoughts, my<br />
private riots.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take shape. America, made for orphans:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now you are made for me. So: I hoist this death<br />
as a bindle<br />
of bleached flannel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and hit this black road where motherless Lincoln<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stopped, his lackeys tripping in its cannon pocks.<br />
In his silence<br />
I see good sense.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cemeteries are like zoos: they teach the art<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of privacy behind their stamped gray placards.<br />
Inviolate<br />
as steel the at-<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-home hours of dens, of the dead. The bear sleeps<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or files its claws; it is not our business,<br />
unbeckoned to<br />
its lone curfew.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This side of that exquisite habitat, we<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the visitors, and pigeons shitting freely,<br />
uncaged. I am<br />
in memoriam,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am Jackie Robinson, I am Huck Finn –<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bastarded since my mother lay down with time.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first test of Filadelfio Vera’s resolve came on a hot day. From the instant he climbed into the Jeep he did not stop sweating. All morning long, rivulets ran down his legs and collected in his socks. They ran down his back, pooling at his belt. By chance, it was also the day that the world rankings for corrupt countries came out. Paraguayans were used to seeing their country classified with the lowest of the low. This time, because of his new job, the news had special meaning for Filo. He was a recruit in the national police, and he intended to stay clean. The problem was the dirt. To get from where you stood to where you wanted to stand, you had to take steps. That was logical. But any place you put your foot down, it came up filthy.</p>
<p>Thanks to a whim of his mother’s, Filadelfio was the only person in Paraguay named after a Mennonite colony in the Chaco Desert. Christmas had fallen midway through Milagros’ pregnancy, and the glass of clericó her uncle served her was sweet. She drank the wine, nibbled the fruit, and announced that the child growing inside her would pay homage to the industrious farmers who had made the desert bloom. To those who knew Filo growing up, the unusual name marked him out. His mother had willed him to be different, and he was.</p>
<p>Sergeant Duarte, in charge of the police station at Salto, had seventeen years on the force. He carried his experience like body fat and moved slowly, breathing ostentatiously through his beak. Duarte complained of allergies, and a lack of respect from his lover now she was turning nineteen. Sending them out on patrol, he patted the hood of the Jeep with a horny hand. “Keep your eyes open.”</p>
<p>Even Filo, greenest of the four on board, knew that meant they should turn a blind eye. If they arrested someone who enjoyed police protection, the wrath of the sergeant would fall on their heads.</p>
<p>They drove into the sun, joking about making a sensational arrest. They were young, lean, and full of talk. Mostly what they talked about was the contraband flowing across the Paraná into Brazil, or vice versa, depending on the article in question. Filo listened. Before taking the job he had thought it through and decided he would not worry about consumer goods. Nobody could stop the flow of whiskey and DVDs and Hello Kitty purses, and where was the harm? Drugs were something else. So were weapons. How could you call yourself a policeman and not concern yourself with serious matters affecting the well being of the nation?</p>
<p>Black was black, and white was white. That was his father’s answer to any hard question that came up. Hilario was deaf and dumb, born that way. He made bricks, working alone in a silence Filo grew to understand as a kind of private island no enemy boat could approach. At home, when Hilario had something important to say, he wrote it with chalk on a blackboard the Belgian missionary had procured for him years ago. The law he laid down on slate never varied. Black was black, and white was white. His father’s son, his mother’s son, Filo did not fail to absorb the lesson.</p>
<p>The other cops ribbed him without mercy. An earnestness he had not learned to hide brought it out in them. After a half hour of aimless driving they dropped him at a brushy thicket alongside the big green river. Behind the wheel, Gomez squinted, pointing with his cigarette. “See that tree? If it moves, arrest it.”</p>
<p>It was funny so everybody laughed, Filo included. Gomez had a year and a half in the service and knew how things worked. Filo watched them drive off. He watched the red dust settle in the road. Then he found a place in the shade, leaned his rifle against the tree he was supposed to arrest, and relaxed. He didn’t mind working alone. The solitude gave him time to think about Maia, and the baby on its way. His mother had cried when he told her the girl was pregnant, not because she disliked Maia – she was fond of her – but because it portended the end of her son’s ambition. Filo was realistic enough to know she was likely right.</p>
<p>Still, no matter what the future brought, he intended to hang onto his good habits. In school, the teachers had used Filo to show how talented they were. He could memorize anything. Once, when he was twelve, a supervisor from the education ministry came to the school for a graduation ceremony. She was a formidable truck of a woman with a dictator’s voice. The director of the school had made Filo memorize the capital cities of the fifty North American states, an easy assignment, really. The woman from the ministry understood that his talent had nothing to do with the teachers. She put their noses out of joint by hauling him into the director’s office, slamming the door in their faces. She took a seat behind the desk and looked at him for a long little while, absently tugging at the strap of her brassiere in a way that distracted him. Apart from the tremble of flesh what he remembered, at this distance, was her advice. You have something special, boy. When you figure out what it is, don’t sell it cheap.</p>
<p>Well, failing to learn what it was, or what it was good for, he had sold cheap.</p>
<p>For the discipline of it, standing under the tree he ran through the names of the capitals of all the departments in Paraguay, and then the major rivers of Canada. That worked one level of his mind. On another level, he felt an agreeable sexual stir thinking about Maia. Since they had learned she was pregnant, she had gotten into the habit of lying in bed on her back at night, legs spread, guiding his hand across her belly tracing the imagined outline of their child. That was a nice thing to think about, but he shook it off. He was working.</p>
<p>He roused himself and strolled down to the edge of the river where dragonflies with nervous wings made erratic turns in the thick air. Ten meters out, a fish jumped twice, flashing pale green. This was supposed to be a regular launching spot for boats crossing to Brazil. In full daylight he did not expect to see anything brazen but wondered what he would do if a boat came in, loaded with perfume and football jerseys. He wasn’t sure. He went back to the tree and sat crosslegged in the grass with his back against the trunk.</p>
<p>Butterflies collected where sap ran, fluttering drunk. A jet black beetle with antlers climbed a stalk, causing it to bend just a little. Out in the road, a khaki cow shuffled by with a board collar hanging broken from its neck. Filo felt funny. He became aware of the breathing of giant lungs, a regular and reassuring sound. He was resting on an invisible tray, offered up to the owner of the lungs. Somewhere a colossal cup collected all the tears that had been cried since the beginning of time.</p>
<p>He took the feeling of jubilant wholeness that came over him not as a sign but as a hint. Could it be he was meant, after all, to be a policeman? What happened next reinforced the hint. He heard labored breathing and got quietly to his feet, as startled when he saw him as the kid he surprised. The kid was carrying a sack over his shoulder, struggling with the awkward weight of it. When he saw Filo’s uniform he dropped the sack and took off running.</p>
<p>Filo’s mistake was stopping to look inside the sack just long enough to see tightly packed bricks of marijuana. The kid was barefoot and knew where he was going, and those few seconds gave him a head start. Filo grabbed his rifle and lit out after him; cops did not leave their weapons behind. The kid followed a grown-over path through brush along the river for half a kilometer. When he made a sudden move toward the road Filo lunged, getting a hand on his shoulder and yanking. They went down in a tangle though Filo was careful to keep the rifle out of harm’s way, as he had been trained to do.</p>
<p>In the fray, notwithstanding the heel to the groin he took, he thought, I love this. I love enforcing the law. It was exhilarating. But fear gave his opponent the strength of desperation, and he wriggled free and ran again. Filo’s groin was tender where he had been kicked, and he could no longer keep up. You didn’t shoot a kid in the back for transporting a few kilos of marijuana, so he watched him disappear before going back to claim the sack.</p>
<p>When Gomez and the others came by to pick him up, they were puzzled what to do with the marijuana. Filo asserted himself. Black was black, and white was white. He insisted they take it back with them. They rode back to Salto in an uneasy silence, not sure what to expect from their boss. But Duarte only muttered when he learned what Filo had done. He cursed sideways saying,</p>
<p>“It’s evidence. Lock it in the storeroom.”</p>
<p>Filo carried the sack inside, deposited it on a shelf, and snapped the padlock shut on the door to the storeroom at the back of the station. When he turned around, there was Duarte telling him he had a lot to learn about the job.</p>
<p>“Sí, mi sargento,” Filo agreed. It was true. He had a lot to learn.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was chance that took him and Maia near the police station on their evening walk, perhaps not. Filo had read that pregnant women should stay in shape, it made the birth easier. Regardless, it was pleasant to stroll the sandy streets as the sun was going down, feeling sweet relief as the heat of the day drained away and the evening reached a civilized temperature. They walked every night.</p>
<p>The station was an adobe building painted blue, with a bar of dark red running around the base. In front stood a hitching rail nobody used anymore. The windows were barred. Not just those of the two tiny cells but all of them, which Filo found emblematic. The bars reinforced the sense of menace the station projected, daring citizens to imagine what it would be like to find themselves on the inside looking out.</p>
<p>It was getting dark. Bats were hunting bugs across the violet velvet air. Approaching the station Filo took Maia by the arm and shushed her. She had been telling him about one of those television shows where famous people danced in a contest and then talked about how they felt. The new policeman and his wife stood there in the dusk watching Sergeant Duarte come out the front door of the station carrying the sack of marijuana that Filo had impounded. He looked up and down the street out of habit but did not see them. He threw the sack in the back seat of his car, a Brazilian VW, and drove off.</p>
<p>“He told me I have a lot to learn about being a policeman,” Filo told Maia.</p>
<p>“And, are you learning?”</p>
<p>He leaned close, smelled his wife’s scent of unnamable flowers, and kissed her on the cheek. “Yes, my love. I am learning.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>They were spending too much time talking about money, a subject that exasperated Filo. Maia understood the system. She knew that, sooner rather than later, he would be offered the chance to supplement the pittance he earned each month. The longer he stayed on the force, the greater the opportunities that would come his way. It was reasonable to think a man in his position might someday have the wherewithal to purchase a car, build a house, properly educate his children. Maia wanted all of those things, as well she should. But she also understood the man she had married. She would not pressure him to do violence to what she called his Filadelfio principles. The money talk was a kind of compulsion, but it served to remind them who they were not.</p>
<p>The heat of December impressed itself on Salto, embedded itself in every animate creature, every inanimate object. Look up the street, you saw waves shimmering like bright snakes. The heat hugged you close, it kissed you with poison lips. You sweated through your shower. Ice floes clogged your daydreams, carrying penguins expelling chilled air as they barked for help. If you went to the Paraná you could practically see it evaporating, invisible sheets of water rising from the surface of the river into the saturated atmosphere. Filo and Maia slept with the windows open, a fan blasting to keep off the mosquitoes. She slept poorly, waking to guide his hand with hers across the unmapped continent of her swelling belly.</p>
<p>The sky had been overcast all day the evening that Duarte sent Filo’s squad out on patrol with an order you could take two ways. It wasn’t true that the webwork of gray clouds kept the air any cooler, but it was useful to pretend it did.</p>
<p>“Do your duty,” Sergeant Duarte said. “Don’t come back empty handed.”</p>
<p>It was guns. Filo knew it in his gut, and he was right. Gomez drove the jeep to the same spot on the river where they had left him the first time. Filo recognized the tree where he had rested, remembered the exhilaration he had felt, chasing the kid who got away. Gomez switched off the engine, but for a moment nobody moved. Filo perceived a kind of solemnity in the squad, arising from a feeling of purpose. They were playing their part in a ritual they did not completely grasp. Gomez broke the spell, telling them to get moving. In a few minutes the sun would go down. The night bugs were already testing their voices.</p>
<p>They went single file south along the river bank, moving quietly under the cover of high trees with drooping fronds, dense bushes with fat, thick bodies that got fatter and thicker as the light waned. After twenty minutes’ walking, they picked up the sound of business. Boxes were being stacked, men were blowing spent air from their lungs and cursing in low voices. Metal on metal, metal on Mother Earth. But before they saw what they had come to see, a guard with a Kalashnikov stood blocking their way on the path.</p>
<p>He had a gold tooth and a hard face. He had muscles and tattoos. He wore no shirt, just a leather vest that gave him the look of a movie cowboy. Filo knew what pathology meant and recognized that this guy had been hired by bosses because he lacked empathy with his fellow man.</p>
<p>“What do you sons of bitches want?”</p>
<p>Gomez knew what to do. This was not the first time he had led a squad into a tricky situation. He had thought through his lines. “What’s going on, back there behind you?”</p>
<p>“Whatever it is, it’s none of your goddamn business.”</p>
<p>“We’re the police,” said Gomez, warming to his role, liking it; liking, even, going up against a man in a vest with a world-famous weapon. “Our business is whatever we say it is.”</p>
<p>They were speaking in Guaraní, but the guy with the Kalashnikov had a Brazilian accent. That made it come out like clown talk, and Filo couldn’t help smiling.</p>
<p>“What’s so funny?”</p>
<p>Filo shook his head. No sense making things worse. He made an effort to eradicate the smile, and it went away.</p>
<p>“We’re going to have to inspect those boxes of yours,” Gomez said, reaching for irony but not quite achieving it.</p>
<p>“What boxes?”</p>
<p>“The ones your friends are tossing around.” He pointed. “Back there. Who knows, they might contain contraband, and we’d have to arrest you.”</p>
<p>“Who sent you?”</p>
<p>Gomez could not answer him with Sergeant Duarte’s name. That was not how the thing was done. Black was black, thought Filo reflexively, and white was white. He understood that nothing would happen until Gomez and the guard with the gold tooth were tired of feeling each other out. It was a chest-thumping exercise, sure, but that was only part of it. The rest had to do, obscurely but surely, with money. It ended ten minutes later with the delivery of an envelope to Gomez. The envelope was grubby. Trudging back toward the jeep in the gathered gloom, the policemen were disappointed not to have had a glimpse of the cargo being readied to cross the river. Filo, too. But his disappointment was doubled because he had to admit to himself that he had failed to do the right thing.</p>
<p>Of course he had the whole drive back to Salto, watching the cones of the headlights bore jumpy holes in the darkness, to think about how to make up for it. At the station, Gomez went into Duarte’s office with the sergeant and came out five minutes later with money in pale blue envelopes for everyone in the squad. Filo refused to take his.</p>
<p>“What do you mean, you don’t want it?” Gomez said. He had one restless eye, which was of a lighter color than the other and moved independently. The eye aggravated Filo. “You earned it.”</p>
<p>Filo shook his head, said it again. “Ndai potái.”</p>
<p>Gomez shrugged. Filo saw him wondering whether he should share out Filo’s cut to the rest of the squad, or take it back to the sergeant. Being cautious, he disappeared again into Duarte’s office. Filo wanted to keep it simple, keep it clean. He felt dirty. Anyway the shift was over. He went out the door and walked home and showered. That night, for the first time, he felt the baby’s tiny kick.</p>
<p>That was not the end of the matter, nor did he expect it would be. The next day, Duarte asked him if he knew how to drive. Filo told him he didn’t.</p>
<p>“Then you’re going to learn.”</p>
<p>He grabbed Filo by the arm and dragged him out of the station. It did not take long. Filo was good with mechanical things and in fifteen minutes he was comfortably working the clutch and the gear shift of the official vehicle. He liked it. Driving gave him a sense of control he was not accustomed to experiencing. He followed the directions his sergeant gave him and wound up parked in front of a small pink house on the outskirts of Salto. The house was notable for its tidy aspect. The front yard was free of weeds. The shutters were freshly painted. They went around the side of the house to the back patio where they found a beautiful woman sweeping up leaves.</p>
<p>“Nanci,” said Duarte, “This is Filadelfio Vera. He is a policeman, like me.”</p>
<p>Nanci stopped sweeping and smiled at Filo. She was as dazzling a woman as he had ever seen. Long dark hair a little wild, a tall body with prominent breasts and shapely arms, skin the color of copper, a face you might see stamped on an ancient coin. A queen’s face. She pointed them to plastic chairs under the shade of a grapefruit tree, and Filo marveled how a woman as young and perfect as she was could find an ugly man like Duarte acceptable. She served them tereré in a polished cowhorn on which the figure of a bull was carved. The straw through which they drank the tea was genuine silver, not aluminum. It had to be a present from Duarte.</p>
<p>“Here’s the problem,” said the sergeant, sucking loudly on the straw, then handing her the cowhorn.</p>
<p>She turned a face of vicious innocence on him. “Where?”</p>
<p>“Vera is like that saint, what’s his name? The animals loved him. Birds landed on his shoulder.”</p>
<p>“Francis of Assisi.”</p>
<p>“That’s the one. I keep telling Vera there’s no place for a saint in a police station. What we need are realists.”</p>
<p>Nanci nodded thoughtfully. “I see. You think he ought to be more like you. Interdict marijuana and resell it. Shake down businessmen. Fuck a woman who isn’t his wife and tell her lies she might possibly believe for a certain period of time. Go on telling the same lies after she stops believing them.”</p>
<p>Duarte shrugged. “I never had a son, you know.”</p>
<p>“What about me?” said Filo. “Don’t I get to say anything?”</p>
<p>Nanci handed him the tereré. “Nobody’s stopping you.”</p>
<p>“I never wanted to be a policeman.”</p>
<p>She asked him, “What did you want to be?”</p>
<p>Filo thought for a moment, wanting not so much to be truthful as accurate. “I thought I might have my own television show.”</p>
<p>Duarte snorted but managed to ask him, “What kind of show?”</p>
<p>“Like a quiz show. We would invite guests, qualified and intelligent guests, to ask me questions.”</p>
<p>Nanci saw where he was headed. “They would ask very hard questions, but you would know the answers.”</p>
<p>“I can memorize anything.”</p>
<p>She shook her head. “It wouldn’t work.”</p>
<p>“How come?”</p>
<p>“Nobody watching the show at home would believe that one man knew all those answers.”</p>
<p>“But I would know,” he insisted. “That’s the thing. I would always know.”</p>
<p>“She’s right,” Duarte added in a flat voice that put an end to the discussion. “It wouldn’t work.”</p>
<p>It was the first time in Filo’s experience that he had gone through a conversation that had nothing to do with the words coming out of the mouths of the people having it. He understood he was being warned, and that Duarte believed he was acting in Filo’s best interest. The next time they went out on patrol, Duarte ordered Gomez to let Filo drive. Gomez didn’t much like that but saluted and handed Filo the key. All the way to the river Filo had the sensation of being watched by Gomez’s independent eye.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was a philosophical question, the kind of thing Filo found stimulating. If a given place on the planet – say, Salto, in Paraguay – started off very hot, what did it mean to get hotter? He craved a philosophical answer but none came. All he had were examples. A lizard on a brick at three in the afternoon begging for mercy. Sunburnt ants. The breath going into your lungs hotter than the air you expelled. The stifled songs of birds. Start paying attention and heat was like God, part of everything, source and destination, the main idea and the fire burning it out.</p>
<p>Approaching Christmas, the heavy odor of coco flowers sweetened the scorched air, and the woman next door mixed  a pitcher of clericó. Tasting it, Filo thought about his mother and took the bus out of town to Campo Florido. He arrived at siesta time when both his parents were asleep in leather hammocks out back under the shade of stumpy trees. His father was a light sleeper and sat up the instant Filo put his foot down. They spoke in shorthand sign language, and Filo got an answer to the question he did not quite know how to pose. Black was black, his father’s arthritic brown hands slashed, and white was white.</p>
<p>The baby kept growing in Maia’s womb, a vow unto itself. Filo bought a child-care book and read it aloud to his wife, trying to distract her from the heat which was making her pregnancy a trial. Once, they visited Filo’s schoolfriend Paquito and the woman he was living with. Idoya wanted a car. That was fine, it was a normal desire. But she wanted it so badly she was pushing Paquito to take a job with one of the contraband kings. Filo wanted his friend to say no, nothing could induce him to take the job, but only mush came out of Paquito’s mouth. All the way home Filo fretted, and by some mysterious troubling connection he felt responsible that night when Maia shook him awake in terrible pain.</p>
<p>“The baby is dying,” she gasped.</p>
<p>He did what he could to soothe her, which was nothing. Her tears convinced him to go out and find a pharmacy. Since he’d known her, Maia had not cried once. Afraid, he trotted through the sandy streets toward a place whose owner he thought he might be able to roust out of bed. His anxiety spiked when he saw the Jeep, and Sergeant Duarte behind the wheel.</p>
<p>“Get in,” Duarte ordered him.</p>
<p>Filo sputtered, dreading delay. But Duarte did the right thing, and the owner of the pharmacy jumped out of bed when he realized it was the police banging on his door. He listened to Filo’s description of the pain and offered a bottle of orange liquid free of charge, a courtesy to the sergeant. Back at Filo’s, Duarte himself gave Maia two spoonsful of the medicine, speaking in a calm voice of authority that quickly drained the panic from her.</p>
<p>“It was gas,” he said. “I recognized the signs. My wife, you haven’t met her but you will, Soledad suffered from gas with all three of ours.”</p>
<p>“I feel stupid,” said Maia.</p>
<p>“Nothing to feel stupid about. A mother’s instinct to protect her child is a sacred impulse. It comes from God.”</p>
<p>Maia struggled to connect the image of Duarte she had from Filo with the solicitous man at her bedside. She frowned at Filo; later, she would demand an explanation. But Filo knew what his wife could not see. Duarte’s patience and good humor might be real, but they were real the way a magician’s hat was. There was no hurry, there was all the hurry in the world. The sergeant had not been out driving around Salto in the middle of the night to avoid the sun. Filo had to hand it to him, though. Maia never guessed he was zinging Filo with telepathic darts all the time he was there: urgent, urgent; urgent.</p>
<p>The darkness was beginning to blanch by the time they headed out of town.</p>
<p>“You ready to be a father, Vera?”</p>
<p>“I think so, sir.”</p>
<p>“It never stops. You have to provide, and go on providing, until they lower you into your grave.”</p>
<p>“I know that, sir.”</p>
<p>“You like being a policeman, that’s obvious. Turn left. You’re about to get a chance to enforce the law.”</p>
<p>They were heading north and west, away from the river, toward a settlement where Brazilians had bought up most of the land, crowding out the Paraguayans. Brasiguayos, they called them. They worked real hard. In the ten minutes it took to get there Filo figured out that his chance to enforce the law was going to look a lot like a shakedown. Duarte ordered him to park a hundred and fifty meters out from a two-story brick warehouse under a half-finished tinglado roof. As they sat there, red pooled luxuriously across the east sky and a smell emerged from the earth of something sweet and vegetable, like a secret you’d never guess.</p>
<p>“I want to understand this,” Filo said.</p>
<p>“Fair enough, son. That’s fair enough. See those brick walls? They are sheltering a mountain of cocaine. The cocaine belongs to a man with a spider in his pocket.”</p>
<p>“Meaning he won’t share.”</p>
<p>“His name is Frutos. I’ve given him plenty of chances. He always comes up short.”</p>
<p>“So what do we do?”</p>
<p>“Go in with guns drawn and a sincere attitude. Confiscate the drugs. Arrest the peons. Later, I’ll twist Frutos’ arm and we’ll come to an understanding. Can you handle this, Vera?”</p>
<p>Maybe they were doing it for the wrong reason, but they were about to accomplish a good thing, an important thing. Filo had some sense of the damage all that cocaine could do, up and down the chain. The producers, the dealers, those who thrust the powder up their nose. It was like shit. Anybody who touched it came away rank.</p>
<p>“I can handle it, mi sargento. Don’t worry, I can handle it.”</p>
<p>In the act, it was not much of a challenge. Inside the warehouse they startled three humble men sitting on camp stools eating boiled mandioca sticks and gossiping. Duarte was right about one thing. There was a mountain of cocaine. Frutos, whoever he was, ran an industrial operation. Massive mounds of sacks rose toward the open ceiling on pallets arranged in perfect rows, with just enough space between them for a man with a gun to pass. The sacks were thick, hard black plastic, packed so tightly Filo figured it must be done by machine. The place had the feel of a cathedral built in homage to the Devil.</p>
<p>“Stand up,” Duarte ordered the men. “Hands on your heads. Do something stupid and we’ll ventilate your innards.”</p>
<p>He meant it. They knew he meant it. It was easy. That was all there was to it. But as the men stood there with their hands on their heads like chickens about to be trussed, a fumbling sound came from behind the pallets, and something fell to the dirt floor with a flat thud. A door squeaked.</p>
<p>“Get him,” Duarte told Filo. “I don’t want the son of a bitch getting to Frutos before I do.”</p>
<p>Filo ran between two rows of pallets, holding his rifle close to his body. In the soft dark he stum-bled once but recovered and kept going. He raced out the back door, across a field, and into woods that were the only place a man could hide. Chasing him, Filo was happy. Maybe he hadn’t earned the sense of virtue pumping through him like fresh blood, but there it was. He would have a child. Boy or girl didn’t matter, it would be the child to whom he would someday describe the chase, the red morning, the Devil’s drugs, the dismay on the faces of the three chumps left to guard the evil treasure. What had been a hint was now prophecy. He was meant to be a policeman.</p>
<p>The sky was lightening at its own pace. Ahead of Filo a branch snapped, and he heard a cry of pain. He had to go a couple hundred meters farther before he could make out the figure lying on the ground. There was something wrong about what he saw, but not until he came close did he see what it was. The figure belonged to a woman, and she was sobbing.</p>
<p>“Stand up,” he ordered her.</p>
<p>“I can’t. I fell in a hole. My ankle broke.”</p>
<p>Was it a trick? He didn’t think so. She was old enough to be his mother, from the slumped shape of her, and the gravel in her voice. Her hair was tied back, her elbows were scuffed, her forearms were torn bloody by the prickers she had run through. He did not know what to do.</p>
<p>“What’s your name?”</p>
<p>“Pocha.”</p>
<p>“Where were you running, Pocha?”</p>
<p>She sat up but did not stand up, her ankle truly broken. She had the somber face of a person who expected events to go against her. “I don’t want to go to prison.”</p>
<p>“That’s not up to me.”</p>
<p>His answer made no sense to her. She asked him, “If I am in prison, who will feed the birds?”</p>
<p>It was Filo’s turn not to understand. It took a while, but he got the story out of her. Her boy Alejandro had a mental problem. His brain did not work the way adult brains were supposed to work. He needed looking after, she needed money, and there was no father around. That was why she wound up working in a warehouse full of drugs. It seemed Alejandro had a consuming passion. He fed wild birds. He had cultivated a special place, near a low spot of ground where the creek pooled, to which the birds came in expectation of the corn and grain he put out. That was fine, it kept him out of trouble. However, the boy was afraid of the woods he had to pass through to get to his special place, which meant Pocha had to lead him there by the hand every day.</p>
<p>“Stop crying,” Filo ordered her, and she did.</p>
<p>He marveled at the authority of the uniform.</p>
<p>From the distance he heard Sergeant Duarte calling his name.</p>
<p>“Sí, mi sargento. Everything is under control,” he called back. “I am learning how to be a policeman. I am learning it my way, not your way. I do not care for your way of being a policeman. This woman requires my help.”</p>
<p>Okay, that last part he only thought, he didn’t actually come out and holler. The day might come when he would say it, though. Maybe even holler it.</p>
<p>“Try to stand,” he said to Pocha.</p>
<p>He had to set his rifle down to manage it, but he made a pretty good crutch of his body. It was an embrace of necessity. The woman smelled of sweat and desperation.</p>
<p>“Don’t take me to prison,” she said, too bluntly for it to be a whine. “Take me home.”</p>
<p>“Where do you live?”</p>
<p>She pointed in the direction she had been escaping to when she fell.</p>
<p>Duarte was calling again, more impatiently this time. Filo reassured him that everything was under control. He looked forward to a day when he could come out and say the rest out loud, not just in the privacy of his complicated mind. “This woman is not a criminal. You are the criminal, mi sargento. You’re the bad guy in this movie. I am fulfilling my duty to protect her from men like you.”</p>
<p>He would have to come back for his rifle. “How far?” he said to Pocha.</p>
<p>“Not far at all.”</p>
<p>They went slowly through the woods, Pocha hobbling, Filo stiff as the crutch he had to be. For better or worse, his conviction did not fade as they went, it only deepened. He was meant to be a policeman, just not the kind of policeman the sergeant had become. As white morning light engulfed and transformed the woods into a place they could negotiate, he felt the day’s heat rising up to claim him. In a while, odds were, he would wear it like skin.</p>

<p>Jane Austen is alleged to have said that the only things worth writing about are love and money, a dictum that has surely remained current if one is speaking about the novel.  From Samuel Richardson through Austen, Charles Dickens, Henry James, Edith Wharton, Theodore Dreiser, and F. Scott Fitzgerald, and through to such contemporary writers as Tom Wolfe and Toni Morrison (to mention only English-language practitioners), novelists have used this capacious genre to examine the power of love along with the effects of poverty, the conflict among economic classes, and the class system generally in both Britain and America.</p>
<p>The short story is another matter.  Especially now, in our liberal-democratic, post-Romantic literary culture, short-fiction writers relatively seldom deal with themes related to money or the lack thereof.  But the other half of Austen’s observation certainly remains true when one considers that love of all kinds dominates the stories populating our literary magazines and the new collections falling about us on all sides.</p>
<p>Love has been a major theme throughout the relatively brief history of the short story.  In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, pioneering masters of the shorter form excelled at writing tales in which the longing for and the (sometimes) achievement of love-fulfillment were the central focus.  Two of Anton Chekhov’s best, “The Darling” and “The Lady with the Pet Dog,” are great narratives of the way love can change the very core of human identity.  James Joyce’s “Araby,” “Eveline,” and “The Dead” all explore the nature of love at different stages of life—the adolescent romance, the youthful infatuation, and the middle-aged longing for lost love, respectively.  D. H. Lawrence’s “Odour of Chrysanthemums” and “The Horse-Dealer’s Daughter,” perhaps his best stories, are unforgettable narratives in which the immense force of love transcends even those of death and despair in the lives of the author’s beleaguered characters.</p>
<p>As suggested above, love in its many forms remains a pervasive theme in contemporary short fiction, from teenage romance to adult sexual love to middle-aged lust, from the ties that bind lovers, family members, and close friends to the kind of love, whether romantic or familial, that results in bitterness, desperation, and ultimate isolation. Nor does the theme limit the scope and impact of individual writers and the stories they have to tell.  The above examples suggest that such a focus can bring out the genius of such authors as Chekhov, Joyce, and Lawrence, and likewise the volumes reviewed here demonstrate that this immense theme does not baffle today’s short-story writers but rather seems to sharpen their diverse and ample talents.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>Tom Perrotta is a fortunate author:  his novels are often best-sellers and two of them, <em>Election</em> (1998) and <em>Little Children</em> (2004), have been made into excellent and popular films.  Yet his first book was a collection of linked tales, <em>Bad Haircut</em> (1995), and now he returns to the shorter form with Nine Inches, in which small-town New England suburbanites pursue love in all its diversity.  Many of his characters are either teachers or students in schools not unlike the one depicted in <em>Election</em>.  The title story, for instance, refers to the “nine inches rule” instituted by one vice-principal for school dances:  “it stipulated that students had to keep their bodies at least that far apart while dancing.”<br />
The protagonist here is Ethan Weller, a middle-school teacher with a wife, a toddler, and one on the way.  Ethan is delighted when he learns his chaperone duties at the dance are to be shared by Charlotte, an attractive, “Bohemian” art teacher whose freshness and beauty are in stark contrast to Ethan’s child-beleaguered, rather frumpy young wife.  The story is briskly told, if rather predictable.  Outside a men’s room, Ethan kisses the art teacher:</p>
<p>Kissing her just then felt perfectly normal and completely self-explanatory, the<br />
only possible course of action.  There was no hesitation, no self-consciousness, just<br />
one mouth finding another.  He ran his fingers through her hair, slid his palm down<br />
the length of her back, then lower, tracing the gentle curve of her ass.</p>
<p>“Nine Inches” is a story that the late John Updike, who frequently led his own characters through the dance of suburban infidelity, would probably find appealing, but to put it mildly Perrotta lacks Updike’s verbal grace and precision.  All the stories in this collection, though well-paced and clearly written, feature a plain-spoken style that makes each one read like an efficiently composed synopsis for a movie.</p>
<p>Another intriguing but summarily written tale is “One Four Five,” whose title is a musical term referring to a “basic blues progression.”  The protagonist, Dr. Richard Sims—this is one of the few stories not in a school setting—finds himself turning to music as a consolation while living in a “grim condo,” his wife and children having commandeered the house after his infidelity has been revealed.  Unlike the rather romantic scene in “Nine Inches,” Sims’s cheating is hardly worth what he loses:  “The sex with Olga was quick and dirty.  It couldn’t have lasted for more than a couple of minutes.”  The theme of the story, and in fact of several others, is stated here in the story’s last few lines:  despite his enjoyment of his newly discovered love of music, “there was a faint current of dread running beneath his optimism, because good things turned to shit all the time, and you couldn’t always see it coming.”</p>
<p>The stories with adolescent protagonists have a similar tone.  The teenage boy in “The Test-Taker” (wearing a disguise, he earns money taking SAT tests for the benefit of other, less brilliant students) is unhappily involved with a classmate who pays him little attention:  “I wasn’t getting much of anything except a bunch of frustratingly mixed signals from Sarabeth Coen-Brunner, this artsy junior on whom I was nursing a severe unrequited crush.”  The boy in “Senior Season” at least has a girlfriend, Megan, but their relationship is likewise frustrating; she finally breaks up with him via a text message.  One of the best stories in the collection is the unexpected “Backrub,” in which a pizza delivery boy keeps getting pulled over by the same cop for various minor and, in some cases, non-existent offenses.  The boy is vulnerable because he is the only kid in his “posse” of friends who hasn’t been accepted into an elite university, and he responds with something like horror when the cop, middle-aged Lt. Finnegan, pulls him over for the third time and, apropos of nothing, offers him a backrub.  The examination here of a power differential and the presentation of a teenager’s bewilderment when an adult makes sexual advances are beautifully handled.</p>
<p>Perrotta’s stories address youthful love, marital infidelity, and middle-age longings with equal skill but, as noted above, the language lacks the polish and suggestiveness of the very best fiction.  To say that this book is primarily “an entertainment,” to borrow Graham Greene’s term, is not to belittle its stories, but rather to suggest that the reader who buys this book will get interesting plots, sympathetic characters, and clear writing, but not the ambiguity, narrative poise, and lingering resonance found in more “literary” writing.  In short, Perrotta resembles Stephen King rather than Steven Millhauser, but he is nonetheless that enviable kind of writer:  a natural-born storyteller.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>Another storyteller who is both highly regarded and popular, Joyce Carol Oates—several of her novels and stories have been made into movies as well—nonetheless usually seems more concerned with the niceties of language, structure, and style than with plot and “suspense.”  In such early collections as <em>The Wheel of Love</em> (1970) and <em>Marriages and Infidelities</em> (1972), her tales were already boldly innovative; these many years later, one is more likely to recall the structure of individual stories (epistolary narratives, tales that move relentlessly backward instead of forward) rather than the actual plot details.  In her new gathering, <em>Evil Eye:  Four Novellas of Love Gone Wrong</em>, however, the plots are immediately engaging and suspense is palpable (not surprisingly, this book is published by Mysterious Press) even as the tales resonate with their allegorical, Hawthornean themes.  (Even in the 1980s, Oates observed that “every third or fourth story of mine is probably in this mode—‘realistic allegory,’ it might be called.  It is Hawthornean, romantic, shading into parable.”)</p>
<p>In the title novella, a rather timid young woman, Mariana, marries a much older man, the pretentious and intimidating Austin Mohr, famous director of a Performing Arts institute in San Francisco.  As the book’s subtitle warns us, this is no ordinary love but an invasion of Mariana’s being “as of a virulent infection.”  Mohr’s fourth wife, Mariana soon finds herself confronted by Ines, the first wife, who had married Mohr before Mariana was even born.  A once-beautiful woman (“like Catherine Deneuve”), Ines is a mysterious figure, a now exotic-looking actress who nearly causes Mariana to faint when they first meet:  for the “gaily chattering Ines Zambranco was missing an eye.  Where her right eye had been there was an empty socket.”   As in a tale by Hawthorne, this missing eye becomes symbolic of all that bedevils Mariana in her unhappy marriage, and leads to anything but a conventionally happy ending for her unconventional romance.</p>
<p>Even more compelling is a story of obsessive love, “So Near     Anytime    Always,”  in which another relatively naïve young person, a teenage girl, meets an older and rather mysterious “boy” (he turns out to be 22) named Desmond.  At first she is elated that she has her first boyfriend, but ultimately his affection for Lizbeth becomes obsessive; told at a quick-moving pace, evoking sympathy for Lizbeth that recalls the reader’s involvement with Connie in Oates’s most famous story, “Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?,” this is a chilling, compact, and memorable novella.</p>
<p>In “The Flatbed,” a woman attempts a love relationship but, because she was molested as a child, she asserts that “All love is desperation.”  “The Execution” focuses on the perversion of family love and is the only novella told from a male point of view.  At first the narrative lays out a plot familiar from TV movies:  a fraternity kid murders his parents, or so he thinks, but the mother miraculously survives to identify him.  Later, however, she recants her initial accusation of Bart, and the meaning of “love”—this time, in its maternal form—takes on a series of unexpected permutations.  As in all the novellas here, and as in much of Oates’s fiction generally, desperation is a major component in any attempt to transcend the isolated self through impulses of love and longing.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>The seven offerings in Rebecca Lee’s <em>Bobcat and Other Stories</em> are richly layered, rather like Alice Munro’s, and the writing is fresh and fine-tuned.  If these aren’t precisely love stories, nonetheless romantic love is a major concern in most of them, especially in the title story, which narrates with superb good humor and restraint that most treacherous of rituals, the Manhattan dinner party.  Here the hostess-narrator and her husband are an attorney and a novelist, respectively, and most of the guests are literary types—a book editor, a memoirist; what’s interesting here are not the details of the setting, the food, and the witty conversation, though these are presented with great narrative skill, but the subterranean complex of love affairs past and present, of longings never quite fulfilled.  Jealousy is rampant:  for instance, the narrator suspects the beautiful women in her husband’s latest novel are stand-ins for women friends of the couple, and so she suspects him of infidelity, a suspicion that puts the couple into “pure, extrarational opposition.”</p>
<p>Another excellent story is “Min,” featuring an undergraduate who is lassooed into an unlikely task by a Chinese fellow-student:  she is asked to travel to Hong Kong with him, visit his family, and supervise the process of arranging his marriage.  Though Min assures the narrator, Sarah, that this ritual is a mere formality, that “romance bores me,” and that he will not be obligated to marry the young woman chosen, nonetheless Sarah takes her task very seriously, finding that she is unexpectedly moved by the photographs and resumes of the many candidates for Min’s hand.  Similarly, in “Slatland,” a young girl named Margit is drawn into a relationship with a child-psychology professor (several of Lee’s stories are set on college campuses) who affects her life strongly on two occasions, first in 1967 and again in 1987.   On the first occasion, she is only ten years old, and has fallen into a serious depression because she senses that her father is having an affair and that her parents’ marriage is on the verge of collapse.  The professor tells her:  “For every situation there is a proper distance. . . .  Sometimes you just need to jump up for a moment, a foot above the earth.  And sometimes you need to jump very far.  It is as if there are thin slats, footholds, from here to the sun.”  This need to gain perspective comes in handy twenty years later, too, by which time Margit is married to a Romanian man whom she begins to suspect of having another wife and family back in the “old country.”  In this upsetting situation, she finds that her need for perspective—for visiting “Slatland”—is even more dire, and she recalls once again the advice of the professor who helped her so greatly when she was only ten.</p>
<p>Easily the best story in Lee’s collection is “The Banks of the Vistula,” in which a student assigned a term paper copies almost word for word the chapter from a book published in the 1940s that is mostly Soviet propaganda.  The book had not been signed out since 1956, so the narrator rests assured that her plagiarism will not be discovered.  But she has unwittingly set into motion a complex chain of events:  her professor, Stasselova, becomes intrigued with his “brilliant” student and asks her to present the paper at a symposium on Language and Politics.  Soon student and professor are engaged in a complex dance of a relationship in which each is both fascinated and perplexed by the other.  Lee handles masterfully the setting of a small Midwestern college; the minor characters—her roommate, her erstwhile boyfriend Hans—are richly drawn; and Professor Stasselova’s politically charged past (he was a Russian soldier during the Nazi reign of terror) contrasts tellingly with the narrator’s naivete and inexperience.  Superbly written, hugely ambitious, and unpredictable, “The Banks of the Vistula” is a story that continues to resonate even after several rereadings.</p>
<p>As suggested above, Lee needs a lot of space:  most of the stories here run over thirty pages.  It could be said they are less like traditional short stories than like compressed novels, whole worlds packed into ingenious, well-paced narratives.  Moreover, Bobcat and Other Stories is not merely a random collection of disparate tales but a unified book whose ambitions reach beyond the characters’ personal struggles with love and into the realms of politics and philosophy.  They amply repay careful reading and rereading, and constitute one of the best American short-story collections of recent years.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>Peter Makuck, in <em>Allegiance and Betrayal</em>, deals with love relationships with a virtuosity and vigor similar to Lee’s.  His stories take place in a variety of settings, and they portray youthful love, family conflicts, and love between friends with formidable skill.  The first three stories, which suggest an unfortunately aborted novel, portray a young man named Tim Budney, who leaves home to attend a Franciscan-run college in Maine called St. Anthony’s.  They effectively recall the emotions of leave-taking, the plangent memories of his girlfriend back home, and his awkward attempts to find his identity as he departs a familiar environment and heads into unknown territory.</p>
<p>In “Visitation,” the movement is in the opposite direction as middle-aged Derek returns home again to visit his dying mother and his inconsolable father.  This is a wonderful mood piece, and Derek’s parents’ melancholy surroundings weigh heavily on their grown son’s spirit.  Makuck’s writing conveys the family’s sadness memorably.  Derek’s father has stopped going to visit his wife, and stays home in a depressingly rendered environment:  “TV greased the walls with its narcotic blue flicker.”  The old man’s refrigerator is “frighteningly empty”:  “There was a jar with one pickle afloat, a few black bananas, cold cuts, and two six-packs of beer.”  When the two men visit a funeral home, preparing for the inevitable, they endure the work of coffin-shopping:  “The coffins had supports curtained off so that each seemed to be fixed in permanent levitation, the magician gone.”  Throughout this bleak tale, Derek’s love for his parents imbues the writing with an almost sinister melancholy, and finally he learns only that “The death of parents didn’t leave you free; they left you haunted by memories.”</p>
<p>Other stories deal with marital love, the treacheries of friendship, and the brittle nature of family ties.  In “Booger’s Gift,” the title character, and he is a “character” in more ways than one, charms the narrator, Greg, into an advantageous deal while trying to buy Greg’s used car.  Though Booger ultimately gets away with some of Greg’s money, nonetheless Greg learns a valuable lesson about the rift in his marriage—he has recently separated from his wife—and how he must try again to make his relationship work.  In “Friends,” several married couples commiserate with one another over the sudden disappearance—no preparation, no good-byes—of another couple they knew and loved well.  Near the end of the story, one character exclaims, “I mean, how do you go from loving people, from being ready to do anything for them, to hating them?  I don’t get it.” And in “Family” (Makuck might have worked a bit harder on some of his title), a reunion brings the narrator, Mark, a card-carrying liberal, into collision with an aunt who sends holiday cards that include “a printed leaflet with a color photo of an aborted fetus in a surgical basin.  Merry Christmas.”  The two argue about such issues as Biblical literalism and gay rights, but just as Mark is about to leave the reunion in disgust, his aunt places her mark upon him:  “It was the first time she had ever kissed me, and as I drove through the altering colors of sunset, her kiss burned like a brand upon my cheek.”</p>
<p>If most of Makuck’s stories of “allegiance and betrayal” are tinged with melancholy, and leave his characters embroiled in romantic or family love relationships feeling a sharp sense of isolation, nonetheless the author’s adroit use of language is uplifting in itself.  Vivid and unsparing, these stories linger in the memory long after they are read and reread.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>Steve Yates’s <em>Some Kinds of Love</em>, winner of the Juniper Prize, is certainly the most wide-ranging collection among those considered here.  The book’s protagonists include highway construction engineers, Civil War survivors, designers of a catalogue that features sex toys, gay men embroiled in a troubled relationship and, for good measure, a Pakistani terrorist.  In the broadest sense imaginable, these are love stories, though the characters are so involved in the minutiae of daily life that love comes at them unexpectedly, but no less forcefully for that.</p>
<p>In “The Fencing Lady,” for instance, which suggests the influence of Annie Proulx, the highway engineer, Dale, works with a woman to install fencing along a stretch of road outside Seligman, Missouri.  Both are rough-hewn characters, and soon find themselves making love inside “Porta-Pottys” and in the beds of pickup trucks.  The woman, Patty, brings an efficiency and matter-of-factness to the lovemaking:</p>
<p>Her arms hemmed him, pressed him into a softness beneath which he could feel<br />
the knot and rill of confident muscles.  Their meetings held an aura of abandon,<br />
like the feeling he remembered leaping off bluffs into Table Rock Lake, and<br />
Patty’s immediate return to business afterwards finalized and cleansed the activity<br />
like water.</p>
<p>When Dale realizes Patty is cheating him by using inferior materials for the fence construction, the love affair comes to a bittersweet ending.</p>
<p>Other stories deal with relationships already broken up but still resonant in the protagonists’ lives.  In “New Father,” Mike and Teresa share custody of their four-year-old son, Conrad, but the situation is agonizing for Mike, since Teresa brings a parade of new men through her house, exposing the boy to them.  During one visit with Conrad, Mike learns that one of these boyfriends had had a wreck while Conrad was in the car, an incident Teresa had kept secret from her former husband:  “Teresa had lied to him, concealed the wreck for months now. . . .  The lies were a circle, one stemming from the other to another, inseparable, churning.”  One of the most melancholy details in “New Father” is the three-word phrase the boy, Conrad, supplies to his parents’ every query:  “You tell me.”  Clearly the boy at age four needs answers, and just as clearly seems to know they will never come.</p>
<p>One of the best stories is “Homecoming,” in which a young woman does volunteer work at a makeshift Union hospital before heading home to Missouri after the Civil War.  The most memorable scene is her encounter with a seriously wounded young soldier whom she tends and comforts the best she can.  As she finishes shaving him, she notices that he is sexually aroused, and she accedes to his plea:  “I will never see another woman.  Please.”  Deftly giving him sexual relief, she risks her own reputation and her family’s good name, after which the young man tells her:  “I did not mean to do this to you, to put you through this. . . .  You are noble.”</p>
<p>Although Yates is to be praised for his attempt to portray so many “kinds of love,” a couple of the stories are not really convincing. “Tuesdays at the Center for Excellence” portrays two gay men improbably named Cruett West and Inns Jameson.  Their testy relationship as former lovers is sometimes amusing to behold, but the writing is rather stilted, as when Cruett says, “Inns Jameson, don’t you dare be so fustian with me!”  Even less believable is the relationship in “The Green Tomato Marquesa’s Night of a Thousand and One Triumphs,” which has a dubious love scene between a middle-aged librarian named Maudelynne Arnot Dabb, whose major concern in life is correctly shelving such periodicals as Saving Louisiana!, and a young Pakistani whose primary goal is to blow up New Orleans.  Nonetheless they do get together:  “After dinner they made love.  Deprived of women and isolated, Jamil lasted all of one minute and thirty-three seconds.”</p>
<p>Still, Yates is to be admired for his wide-ranging ambition in this book.  <em>Some Kinds of Love</em> is for the most part beautifully imagined and written.  If the dubious maxim “Write what you know” is here ignored almost to a fault, the author, like the other short-story practitioners reviewed here, is certainly an intrepid explorer of the human heart.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An outdoor bench in the hospital gardens,<br />
the terrace bordered by waist-high,<br />
vase-shaped bushes. Because it was Sunday,<br />
the streets were empty and sounds not audible<br />
for the rest of the week were audible now.<br />
The opening and closing of a door. The voice<br />
of a man scolding his child. A moped stopping<br />
at the curb. Bird sounds, and not just city pigeons,<br />
but finches, chickadees, starlings, jays.<br />
The gardens weren’t too crowded, the sunlight<br />
wasn’t too bright, the air was neither too hot<br />
nor too cold. Though I observed them very carefully,<br />
the expressions on the faces of the people nearby<br />
were careful not to give anything away.<br />
To my left, the branch of a shade tree hollowed<br />
by insects still bore a few leaves, and where<br />
the forked trunk split, a plastic grocery bag<br />
was lodged like the nest of an animal or bird.<br />
And so the hour passed, each moment saved<br />
from a morning wasted in useless self-reflection,<br />
and by the time I went back indoors, anything<br />
seemed possible, happiness as well, as long<br />
as my mind kept pace with whatever<br />
new perceptions came my way.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>As if I were a newcomer to my own emotions,<br />
the first thing she asked me was “How do you feel?”<br />
I did my best to give her a thoughtful answer,<br />
but when I saw that she didn’t even note it<br />
on her legal pad, I began to revise, augment,<br />
elaborate on what I’d said. This went on until<br />
I was no longer sure what I was trying to say,<br />
as if my words had only confused my thoughts,<br />
and I felt the urge to ask if I could start over again.<br />
Perhaps to verify my impressions, she took up<br />
the narrative and played it back more or less<br />
in my own words, choosing this image,<br />
not that, this phrase, not that, carrying on<br />
until she reached the moment where I’d left off.<br />
But why stop there? Since we already shared<br />
a point of view, why not push on to the conclusion?</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>On the wall behind her, a hand-textured<br />
canvas print of Tuscan tiles, the brushstrokes<br />
varying from one square to the next, first left to right,<br />
then top to bottom, then left to right again.<br />
Though I expected it to be filled with tissues,<br />
the trashcan was empty, as was the acid green<br />
Lucite vase on the table. It seemed that<br />
wherever I rested my eyes I was reminded<br />
that I was talking to a stranger, and in so doing<br />
that I was learning all over what it means to exist.<br />
Pleased with the progress I was making,<br />
at session’s end she warmly extended her hand<br />
and I, in turn, received it (slavishly) in both of mine.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Waking early, as I often did, it took little effort<br />
to create the effect that something was in store for me,<br />
and whatever that was would come as a surprise.<br />
Likewise, nothing seemed more natural than<br />
the thought that I was led by rather than leading<br />
my life, the truth of experience always only about<br />
to be mine. Though the effect was brief, the memory<br />
of it lingered, and from time to time throughout<br />
the day it came over me, the sense that I was<br />
traveling “lifeward,” becoming myself all over again.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Eye-level in the overheated waiting room,<br />
a fireplace fire played in a loop on the television screen.<br />
It was difficult to tell where the loop began,<br />
though the logs continued to burn and the flames<br />
continued to rise. As if testing the heat of the fire,<br />
a child reached out then quickly withdrew his hand.<br />
Somewhere behind me a cell phone rang;<br />
in front of me, an old man in overalls<br />
tapped his leg with a magazine while his wife,<br />
tiny and archaic, sucked the inside of her cheeks.<br />
Out of consideration, no one looked at anyone<br />
directly, but at everyone from the corner<br />
of an eye. From time to time a man in white<br />
arrived to survey the room. He understood<br />
all of us, and all of us had something to be understood.<br />
From a distance it might’ve appeared<br />
that we were there because we had nothing better<br />
to do, and nowhere better to do it, that nothing<br />
mattered less than the world beyond the world inside</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Having signed out early in the afternoon,<br />
I bought apples at the farmer’s market, a wedge<br />
of pie at the bakery, a newspaper at a stand.<br />
On my way to catch the crosstown bus,<br />
I stopped to watch as one by one a tower crane<br />
raised a rusted (or rust-colored) I-beam<br />
from a flatbed up twenty-some stories to the roof<br />
of the City Services Wing. The framing in<br />
of the final floor provided occasion for a topping-off<br />
party in the courtyard of the art museum,<br />
a slate space where, each at a different angle,<br />
a number of canvas bannered tents were anchored<br />
to bags of sand. I sat down on the ledge<br />
of a raised concrete flowerbed planted with rows<br />
of Chicago Brick wrapped in woolen sweater scraps<br />
and sprinkled with mustard seeds. In a few small<br />
patches of light, some of the seeds had started<br />
to sprout, and now and then a woman I took to be<br />
the artist appeared with a watering can. Because,<br />
I assumed, the project required the theoretical<br />
silence of nature, my polite inquiries were met<br />
with an unresponsive stare.  Sympathetic as I am<br />
to the aesthetics of silence, to the childlike fantasy<br />
of escaping the material world of words, the cursive<br />
spray of her watering can and the fluent undulations<br />
that darkened the bricks gave rise to such intensity<br />
of feeling that even hours later, long after I’d stood<br />
and applauded the tedious speeches, I still bore<br />
the impression, the senseless, unshakeable impression,<br />
that I’d been made the butt of an elaborate joke.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>I once read in a book, which I now recall<br />
only in the vaguest terms, that we know the world<br />
not through our sensory perceptions—which are,<br />
at best, unreliable—but through our thoughts<br />
about those perceptions. At the time, the idea<br />
struck me with the force of revelation, for it seemed<br />
that in the delay between sense and reflection<br />
another unarticulated life, another stream<br />
of consciousness, continued on within me.<br />
And I remember thinking: “That’s just how it is!”<br />
On the other hand, there were days of inertia<br />
when the idea struck me as absurd, when thought<br />
seemed little more than a curtain between<br />
myself and the world. And on those days<br />
I made a point of limiting those dealings<br />
necessity requires to the barest possible details:<br />
“My social security number is…” “I need an MR 16<br />
halogen bulb.” “Go three blocks south, turn left<br />
on Lasalle, and you’ll find it next to a comic book store.”<br />
Clearly I hoped to achieve something.<br />
At the very least, to make better use of my time;<br />
at most, to keep my secrets to myself. To earn<br />
the right to observe the world without taking part,<br />
that was the dream: the bystander standing<br />
beside the fact, the fact standing on its own.<br />
A not entirely human dream but one,<br />
nonetheless, in which I was able to lose myself<br />
in the busyness of keeping myself alive.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trevor Weersta dragged a dead calf across one of his father’s empty fields. He pulled it carefully by the legs, each hand wrapped tightly around the ankle. When Trevor came to the burial ditch at the side of the field, he rolled the calf into the open ground and pitched dirt over the body with a heavy, rusted shovel. When he was finished, Trevor walked back to the barn where he saw his father looking up at the sky, at the sun falling down behind the dry and empty land, and at the frail bodies of the cattle that were roaming closer to the fence. His father was hoping for rain. Trevor saw him drop his head, dig his boot into the earth and watch the dirt rise up, the dust settle on top of the dark leather.</p>
<p>There was no more hay to go around, only one half-empty sack of feed and very little water for the cattle that were limping around the pasture with their pink lips hanging open. The livestock that had once grazed over the pasture in bunches was now dwindled to a handful of thin animals. Trevor watched the cattle, tripping over their own legs, some falling down on their bony knees.</p>
<p>“What are they doing?” Trevor asked as his father walked up by the wire fence and stood with one hand on a slanted post, looking at the cattle on the other side. They were huddled together and shivering, a strange thing to do in the humid Missouri summer. Some of the cattle were lining themselves against the rusted barbs, others struggling to even stand.</p>
<p>“I doubt too many people have seen cattle act like this before,” his father said, spitting at the ground. The cows stepped closer, offering low breathless moans. It reminded Trevor of a sound he’d heard years before, his mother lying in the room next to his, his father on a knee at her bedside, running a wet cloth over her forehead throughout the night.</p>
<p>“Why do they moan?” Trevor asked, walking up near his father’s heels.</p>
<p>“Folks in town will say that animals have no sense, no brains, nothing. But these cows aren’t dumb.” Trevor watched his father’s eyes move from one cow to the next. “They know where they get their feed from. They aren’t dumb to who I am.”</p>
<p>His father stood face-to-face with a steer.</p>
<p>“Can’t we save these last few?” Trevor asked.</p>
<p>Trevor’s father placed one hand over the other on a post and squatted behind the thick piece of wood.</p>
<p>“I may have held out hope for too long,” his father said. His brief laugh afterward caught Trevor off guard. “If there is such a thing as hoping for too long.” His father pointed. “Look at the ribs on this one.” He reached between the barbs and brushed the back of his hand over the side of the steer in front of him. “His shoulder blades are rounded now, and he shakes at the knees when he walks. They all do, if you watch them closely.”</p>
<p>“He could be good again for meat. We can borrow more bales from Mr. Penserum,” Trevor said.</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t start fooling yourself.” The steer his father had been touching let out a guttural moan. His father stood. A few of the others pushed their bodies against the fence and pierced themselves. The animals clenched their jaws, their heads tilting up and back each time they drove into a vine of barbs. Thin trails of blood trickled down their sides, striping their brown and black coats in red. Trevor stepped back.</p>
<p>“What are they doing?” Trevor asked, looking at the shadow of his father in front of him.</p>
<p>“They’re starving. Just dying as creatures do.” Trevor’s father put his hand out as if he were going to grab hold of Trevor’s shoulder, then he returned his hand to his side where it seemed to shake. “It might be barely, only by a little, but they see something similar in us. Look in his eyes, that brown one there. Can you see reason in the eyes?”</p>
<p>Trevor had looked into the eyes of many beasts: pigs ramming into one another in the pen, chickens clucking wildly in their cages, groggy mules he used to pull along by a thick rope. These animals weren’t able to last through the three years of drought. As Trevor looked around his father and into the black eyes of the steer, he could see nothing beyond the black.</p>
<p>“I can’t see it,” Trevor said. He watched his father’s face, the jaw slightly open, creases in his cheeks deep with dirt. His father looked as if he were deciphering bad news, the same expression Trevor had seen a few years ago when he was awoken in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Trevor had stood with a hand grasping the door frame of the hallway entrance beside the kitchen table, listening to the town priest and doctor whispering to his father on the porch. Trevor brought himself lower to the ground so as not to be seen, his hand sliding down the door frame, his body crouched. His father never spoke, only nodded, stared, tight-fisted, discerning. This was what Trevor saw now in his father’s face, until his father, without another word, walked away toward the shed, leaving Trevor alone, the cows praying to his father through their mouths.</p>
<p>Trevor’s father pulled out a glass jug and poured the contents into a tin cup—buttermilk. They had just finished eating rabbit stew, something they cooked often because the meat was easy to come by. Trevor’s father had to sell their only gun a year earlier and borrowed Elias Penserum’s shotgun for hunting smaller abundant animals, the ones who could manage the drought.</p>
<p>Trevor looked at the yolky milk in front of him, always dreading this part of the afternoon meal. He wished the thick liquid would vanish. His father stood and scooted the cup closer to Trevor. The liquid undulated to the rim and back down.</p>
<p>“It tastes so awful,” Trevor said.</p>
<p>“It puts a lining in your stomach. It protects you,” his father said, sitting across from him again. “Your great-uncle Art always said it was good for a man. I trust that.”</p>
<p>Trevor ran his fingers over the table, tapping them as his father spoke. He studied the drink once more, then breathed hard and took the cup from the table, pouring the buttermilk down. Trevor wiped his lips with the back of his hand and looked up at his father who was staring out toward the porch, one strap of his overalls undone and hanging at his waist. Trevor admired the rough cut of his father’s unshaven face, his steady callused hand fishing around in a loose pocket under the table.</p>
<p>“If you need to fill the tank,” his father said, handing over a quarter. He ran his hand through his pocket again and pulled out the key to their truck. “Be home before it gets too late. We have equipment that still needs put away. Tonight better than tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Trevor nodded, eyeing the key.</p>
<p>“Mind the roads. Be careful in that big city.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“And put the truck back facing east how I like it.”</p>
<p>After the meal, Trevor drove away from Alanthus Grove toward Pine Creek, a small nearby town. He thought of the farm, almost bare, and the cattle being whittled down so fast. He wondered if anybody, anything would survive.</p>
<p>Trevor came upon the Penserum acreage a few miles down the road. He saw Elias Penserum standing over an old oil barrel in the yard, working splinters of wood and old newspaper inside the barrel in a half-hearted manner. Elias looked up at the truck and tipped his hat. His crops had almost made headway the year before, but a batch of cutworms crawled through his fields, gnawing the roots and tips until there was nothing left. Trevor waved his hand over the hood and pressed the pedal harder. The wind picked up in the cab, and the dust rolled behind him in a solitary cloud. He turned back to look at Elias one more time, watching him slap a mosquito on his skin, brush it off, then put his arms deep into the corroded barrel.</p>
<p>Trevor turned off the narrow dirt road and into town. He was going to pick up James and Danny Blackwell, two brothers he had met while repairing the porch for their father, who was the manager of the bank. Mr. Blackwell was always dressed in full, dark suits. On the day they fixed the porch, James, the older brother, spent the entire afternoon standing over Trevor and his father, watching them as they cut boards and fit them into place.</p>
<p>“Hey, Weersta, what do you think about seeing some fights?” James whispered when Trevor’s father had stepped up into the bed of the truck, getting boards and spare nails.</p>
<p>“How do you mean?” Trevor asked, holding a hammer in his hand.</p>
<p>“I mean you come and pick up me and Danny next Friday afternoon, and we all go to Charles City.”</p>
<p>Trevor looked over his shoulder. James was a dark figure in front of the sunlight, and Trevor couldn’t see around him to his father, but he could hear his father’s grunts and the lumber being dragged off the truck. “Why would I do that?” Trevor asked.</p>
<p>“For the fights, you dummy.”</p>
<p>“What do I want to watch that for?”</p>
<p>“You just sit around that farm of yours with your old man, am I right?”</p>
<p>“Mostly.”</p>
<p>“And you don’t get out, do you?”</p>
<p>“I suppose not,” Trevor said, turning the hammer over.</p>
<p>“Well, here’s your chance. You can get me and Danny outside of Neddelson’s. We’ll be waiting on the east side of the building.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you get your father to take you?” Trevor asked. He could still hear his own father working somewhere behind James, dropping nails onto the metal surface of the truck bed. James looked over his shoulder and all around the yard.</p>
<p>“Do you think he’d let me go to something like that? Hell no. He’d whoop me with a splintery picket if he knew I went there. He’d whoop me with one in each hand if he knew I was going with someone like you. Look, you’re doing me a favor and I’m doing you one.”</p>
<p>Trevor nodded. He didn’t know why he agreed, maybe something about the idea of an adventure away from the farm. As he watched James walk away, Trevor’s father came over carrying a load of boards. His forearms split at the muscle, creating little ridges up and down the arm, making Trevor wonder what a beating from the hands of his own father would feel like.</p>
<p>Trevor pulled up to Neddelson&#8217;s ice cream parlor, spotting James and Danny sitting against the brick wall, Danny scrambling jacks along the ground to begin a new game. Trevor hit the horn, and Danny scooped the jacks and ball into an empty sugar sack, and the two of them came running, glancing over their shoulders with each stride.</p>
<p>“Bet you haven’t ever seen anything like these fights,” James said into the open window of the cab. He slapped his hand on the door. James and Danny got into the truck, Danny scooting his body into the middle, giving James the window seat. James pulled shut the door, and the glove box fell open at his knees. “Nice heap you got here,” he said with a laugh.</p>
<p>The navy paint had chipped off the sides, and the tailgate was kept in place with chicken wire. The driver’s side door could only be opened from the inside, using an aggressive push with the shoulder, and the cap for the gas tank had been lost visiting family in Nebraska the year before the drought set in, the year before Trevor’s mother fell ill. Trevor couldn’t remember much of it, but he could sometimes conjure up that feeling in his stomach, the tingling he felt behind his ears when his mother, on long rides like that, would put his head on her shoulder and run just one finger in swirls through his hair.</p>
<p>Trevor drove slow and steady. He was uneasy and kept feeling an itch at his neck.</p>
<p>“I thought you country boys were wild,” James said. “Let’s see you push this thing.” But Trevor only clung tighter to the wheel. He looked over at Danny sitting between them, shaking the sugar sack, watching the jacks tumble inside.</p>
<p>Danny looked up and said, “How many fights do you think they have tonight?”</p>
<p>“Probably three or four,” James said. “I can’t wait to see somebody get pounded.” When nobody responded, James elbowed Danny in the ribs. “What are you—a sissy?” James turned to Trevor. “Don’t you want to see some blood?”</p>
<p>It took Trevor a moment to realize James was referring to human blood. “Sure,” Trevor said.</p>
<p>“You must be one useless hand out on that ranch,” James said, balling his hand into a fist and releasing it.</p>
<p>Trevor wiped at his brow, trying to ignore the words. James’s collar was open, and Trevor noticed bruises on his upper chest and collarbone, the color of healthy grapes, outlined in black. When James saw him staring, Trevor looked out the window as if he’d caught sight of a rabbit scampering along the road.</p>
<p>“Kind of guy that’s out there daydreaming and guiding saddle-reins, and when the horses come around, whammo, he gets trampled right under,” James said and laughed.</p>
<p>“He looks okay to me,” Danny spoke up, his head tilted toward Trevor.</p>
<p>“I wasn&#8217;t talking to you,” James said.</p>
<p>They were approaching Charles City and buzzards circled overhead. Trevor watched them dip down and snatch at pieces of a deer carcass, but he only looked for a moment, then turned away as they passed. Trevor wanted to stop, to get out of the truck and walk through open space and thick air.</p>
<p>Trevor jammed on the brakes.</p>
<p>“Jesus,” James said.</p>
<p>Trevor let up on the brake and pulled the truck over on Locust Street. It was the main road, and it ran right down the middle of Charles City, alive with people and automobiles.<br />
“Don’t park here. Drive us farther in,” James said. Danny was quiet, and James thumped him on the chest.</p>
<p>“Yeah, farther in.” Danny said.</p>
<p>Trevor put all his weight into the door, and it was stiff in swinging open, calling out with a screech. Trevor left the door open and turned to the brothers. “We’re walking from here,” he said.</p>
<p>“You’re loony,” James said. He pushed Danny across the truck’s bench, until Danny almost fell out. Then James followed and slammed the door.</p>
<p>Trevor walked down the paved road on Locust, not bothering to see if the boys were behind him. He looked instead at the awnings overhead as he passed the local shops. They were dyed in vibrant colors he rarely saw: emerald, magenta, fuchsia, soft reds and yellows. Shop signs had names he’d never heard of before: Swift &amp; Taylor’s Baked Goods, The Stitchery, The Charles Ray Saloon, Pike’s Grocery.</p>
<p>“It’s going to really be something. I saw women fight there once,” James said from behind.</p>
<p>“You did not,” Danny said.</p>
<p>“Like you would know the difference,” James said. “Weersta, what are you doing up there?”</p>
<p>Trevor had stopped under the emerald awning above Hebert’s Fine Metals and was watching a woman across the street, who wore a billowy, powder-blue dress with frills at the cuffs. </p>
<p>She carried an umbrella that was light brown at the stem, and the hook at the bottom, which she covered with her small hand, was made of solid bronze and blinked in the light.<br />
“Weersta,” James said.</p>
<p>Trevor watched the woman’s three little children and imagined them as brothers and sisters he never had the chance to have. As people came down the street, the children weaved through them like thread, giggling all the while with chocolate and candies in their hands. The people walking by smiled and sometimes tried to pat one of the children on the head.</p>
<p>James punched Trevor in the shoulder. “Knock it off. Didn’t your father teach you not to stare like that?”</p>
<p>“It’s un-polite,” Danny said, walking up behind James.</p>
<p>“Impolite,” James corrected. “Christ.” He looked at Trevor. “So, what’s the big deal here?”</p>
<p>Trevor didn’t look at James, but focused instead on the procession of sharp, dark automobiles that sputtered down the road. Several of them beeped their horns, and passengers waved from the windows with fine gloves on their hands.</p>
<p>“What are you, afraid of those big old cars? Can handle a steer and a mule, but you’re scared of a box on wheels? Shoot, Danny and me have been here a hundred times. A thousand. </p>
<p>It’s a bore. This city’s always been a bore and it always will be.”</p>
<p>“I kind of like it here,” Danny said. “They have a fair in the spring with a Ferris wheel that touches the clouds almost.”</p>
<p>“It’s boring,” James said. “Ferris wheels are for prissies.” With that, James walked up the street.</p>
<p>“We better follow him,” Danny said. “I don’t know how to get to the fights.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” Trevor said, but he didn’t want to leave. He followed behind Danny, but kept losing him by a pace. Trevor couldn’t stop looking into the shop windows, and he ran his knuckles across the smooth, painted letters on the glass. He watched the people inside weigh bread loafs in one hand and then the other, spread fingers over ceramic cups and saucers, children dip into wooden candy barrels and come out with a hill of sweets, the kinds of things that could really last. Trevor wondered if he would ever know that feeling again, maybe not happiness, but contentment with the world he lived in with his father.</p>
<p>“Catch up, Weersta,” James said. Trevor looked ahead and saw James and Danny waiting for him at the end of the street, James pointing down a side road.<br />
When Trevor reached the brothers, they were talking about the fights. “It won’t be too hard to watch, will it?” Danny asked.</p>
<p>“Don’t be such a wimp,” James said. Danny turned from James, crossing his arms in front of his chest. James put out a hand and squeezed Danny’s shoulder. “Jeez, you’ll be fine. You’ll love it, I swear.” Danny smiled a little, but closed it up fast as if he didn’t want to show it. “Let’s move,” James said, and he headed down the road.</p>
<p>Trevor could only think of Locust Street. He wondered where all the denim overalls were, the soft straw hats, the cracked and dirty boots and matching hands. He wondered if his father ever thought of selling the farm, or abandoning it and coming to the city, some place like Charles where the going seemed good, and where the people talked to each other and smiled and took the time to call each other by their names. There were people here, lively people, and more than just two, more than just him and his father and a dwindling herd of cattle on a patch of decaying land.</p>
<p>“So, what happens at these fights?” Trevor asked James, not wanting to think of the farm anymore.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen women fight here. Sometimes these old coots fight cocks and hounds too. But people fighting is what makes it interesting. They don&#8217;t even give them gloves or anything, just knuckle to jaw the whole time.”</p>
<p>“There isn’t much blood, is there?” Danny asked, closing his eyes when he said the word blood.</p>
<p>“What do you expect?”</p>
<p>“I hope not much blood,” Danny said.</p>
<p>They had moved beyond the street and into open land. The only thing in the distance was a giant warehouse, where a line of men spilled from the big open doors. Trevor and Danny followed behind James as he walked across the patchy grass and over to the line of men. Trevor looked at the warehouse entrance, tall and wide, and noticed the paint along the outside had faded, like the clothes of the men who stood there in front of him. The cloth at their knees and shoulders was worn and poor, almost hanging on by mere stitches, and their straw hats bore a scattering of small tears. Trevor was surprised at how relieved he was to see these farmers, to look at their dirty work shirts and stained hands. He noticed James and Danny watching the men with anxious faces, staring at the sweat as it rolled down the backs of the farmers’ brown necks, causing dark stains in their shirts. These men put Trevor at ease, knowing some of them had traveled as far as he had, from the same dirt roads and cracked fields.</p>
<p>For a moment, behind one of the men and through the big open doors, Trevor caught a glimpse of the face of a woman in the darkened warehouse. She looked like his mother. Trevor put his hand above his brow to block the sun, and just as he stepped forward to see if it was really her, alive again in the shadows, two men crossed in front of him, shoving one another to pick up a nickel that had fallen in the dirt. It caused such a commotion that other men jumped on the pile, and Trevor couldn’t see anything but body after body fighting for a coin.</p>
<p>Seeing that face, the semblance of his mother, reminded him of what life had been like when she was around, of how it felt to live on a flourishing farm. He tried hard to squash these thoughts when they came, but the memories were so vivid and he couldn’t help himself. Just then he could see the leaning stalks at midday and hear the squeal of head-butting pigs, fighting for position at the trough. His father was there, too, dumping seed over the fence as the wind blew and shavings floated up in the air. And Trevor could see his father pause for a moment, amid the whirlwind of horses neighing and feed falling and the dinner bell ringing and a child playing in the dirt, to look up to the shed where his wife stood, waving down to him.</p>
<p>“Five cents a-piece,” the man said when the boys approached. He was guarding the door with his boulder-chest, his fat chin dangling over the small bit of light coming from inside. It was growing dark behind them, and the brothers very casually dropped coins down the hole, the bucket thanking them with a ching. Trevor pulled out the quarter his father had given him for gas and traded it for nickels. A rush of guilt seized his hand as he held one of the nickels over the can, watching it fall into the bucket.<br />
Trevor stepped inside and looked around. The place was stocked full of boxes and pallets. A few mops and brooms leaned against the opposite wall. Many of the pallets had been pushed aside to form a makeshift fighting ring in the center. Four lamps were stuck on poles, designating the four corners.</p>
<p>There were a few women in the crowd, but Trevor couldn’t spot the one he’d seen before. He wondered why women would show up to such an event, scarves pulled tight around their heads. Trevor noticed a man holding his son up on his shoulders. The man’s pants and shirt were clean, and the clasps of his suspenders shone golden off the light from the lamps. He rocked his son back and forth as the small boy grabbed the man’s hair in fistfuls as if attempting to guide the reins of a runaway horse. There was something wrong in their interaction, something missing as the man tried time and again to explain to the fearful little boy why they were there. “It’s for the fighting,” he kept saying. “Don’t you want to see the fighting?”</p>
<p>Trevor took a seat next to James and Danny atop the stacks of boxes, their legs swinging over the side, heels brushing the wood. Trevor sensed something familiar about the inside of the warehouse, the way the beams along the ceiling were aligned and chipped like the barn back home. The swallows had even nested in the same places—two nests to each corner beam—and the air inside smelled of sweat and whipped hay particles.</p>
<p>James put his fists up, punching lefts and rights into the air. He pushed at Danny to play along. Danny shook his head and pulled back.</p>
<p>“Such a dump,” James said, still weaving left and right like a prize fighter.</p>
<p>“It’s not so bad,” Trevor said.</p>
<p>James turned his punching game toward Trevor and took a real shot at his arm. “No reflexes,” James said.</p>
<p>“Knock it off,” Trevor said, rubbing the burning in his shoulder.</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t blow your top,” James taunted, but put his hands down and adjusted his position on the box.</p>
<p>Trevor looked over at a commotion of men in the crowd exchanging coins and paper money with a loud man collecting bets in his fists. Another man walked from behind a curtain drawn between box pallets on the far side. The first two fighters followed him. The fighter in the gray had a sharp unshaven jaw. His cotton shirt was torn as if slashed with a knife and he was wearing faded blue jeans. He walked out with confidence, alone, without expression or emotion. Trevor thought he recognized the man and tried to figure out where he had seen him before. He had the look of a field hand, muscular and full of veins, but Trevor was sure he had never seen him on any ranch. The other fighter had a pale face with a skinny dark mustache and wore no shirt. He had on dark shorts that came to his mid-thigh and showed his pale, bony legs. He was followed by what looked to be a manager, a gentleman with a nice watch, a suit and fedora. They spoke to one another in German. Trevor recognized the language because Elias Penserum used to hire extra field hands when the crop was good, and many times these men were burly Germans who didn&#8217;t speak a word of English.</p>
<p>Trevor lifted one leg up, tucked it into his chest and rested his chin on his knee, looking over both fighters. The two men were gloveless, just as James had said, baring their knuckles to entertain. The man who had walked the fighters into the ringed area raised his arms, signaling the start of the fight. The crowd of men clapped and stomped violently. The wood vibrated beneath the boys.</p>
<p>The German fighter kept his arms loose at his sides, his bare fists clenched at his hips, his feet moving quickly beneath him. The fighter in the gray kept his left arm stretched down like he was measuring something and lifted his other just under his chin. They danced in their dark leather boots, the German with a polished shine, and the fighter in the gray with muddy scuffs.</p>
<p>The fighters took time in sizing each other, in closing distances and retreating. When one moved to the left, the other moved around to the right, neither making a move to strike and each step countering the other as if balancing the unseen ring. Minutes passed, and the crowd started to hiss at the hopeless fighters, and then the German took a step forward and threw a fast right hand, missing the fighter in the gray. The crowd gasped and awed.</p>
<p>Heat seemed to be rising in the old warehouse. Trevor undid a few buttons on his shirt and looked around to see if he could spot the woman somewhere in the fog of fist-pumping men. He didn&#8217;t see her. He wondered whether or not there truly was a woman who looked so much like his mother or if it was only a silhouette and he had filled the face in himself.</p>
<p>The German drew back, bending his head to the right and left, touching each ear to a shoulder, over and over. The fighter in the gray stayed on his toes, balancing. When the German lunged forward with another straight right hand, the fighter in the gray side-stepped, tucked his chin to his chest, and blocked the forthcoming punch with his right arm pressed against his skull. Trevor noticed James cheering, waving his arms above his head.</p>
<p>But the fighter in the gray had absorbed the shock of the blow and threw an immediate left-hook, landing flush with the German fighter’s eye socket. He then took a stride forward and landed a stiff right to his opponent’s jaw. The German’s head snapped back like a tree branch and the crowd roared again. A small ache grew inside of Trevor as the German tried to step forward and regain his balance. He threw a few jabs to gain distance, but failed as the fighter in the gray dodged each, weaving, and swung a heavy right-hook that landed on the other cheek and split the German’s flesh open under the eye. Blood sprayed across the floor like a tear in a hose line, and Danny put his hands over his face. Trevor noticed James flinch and turn his head for a second, and then look around to make sure Trevor and Danny hadn’t seen him. Trevor set his eyes forward when James looked at him, as if he had seen nothing.</p>
<p>With each strike of the fist, the ache inside Trevor grew.</p>
<p>“Is it done, is it over?” Danny asked above the noise of the crowd.</p>
<p>The fighter in the gray stepped forward once more as the German stumbled back, putting his hand to his face, feeling for the open wound. The German hunched over for a second, and the fighter in the gray threw an uppercut under the German&#8217;s down-turned chin, knocking a tooth from the fighter&#8217;s mouth and sending him to the dirt floor. The crowd went up again as the fight came to an end. The German was out on the ground, his arms stiff at his sides, his legs shaking involuntarily. A few men ran up and patted the fighter in the gray on the back, but the fighter in the gray did not acknowledge them or what they were cheering for. He kept his head low and his chin tucked, something desperate to his face as he walked behind the curtain.</p>
<p>Trevor looked over at Danny still curled up and using his hands to block his sight.</p>
<p>“You can take your hands away,” Trevor said, “It’s okay to look now.”</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t worry about him,” James said. “He&#8217;s afraid of everything.”</p>
<p>Trevor stared at the curtain as if he could see through the purple cloth to where the fighter in the gray was walking, fingers tipped with blood, head low and out of sight. Trevor jumped down from the box and pushed through the crowd. He didn’t know where he was going, but he knew he needed to get out of there. He could hear James yelling from afar as he left, could hear his bully chants until he walked into the cool, open air and kept moving, feeling the beat of his boots on the patchy grass.</p>
<p>Trevor found it somehow louder now on Locust Street. The evening was coming on, and the streets were filled with more people, mostly men in suit jackets and fedoras. The women were generally gone, and there were no children running around to weave between the people. Trevor was almost run into by a man with a thin mustache who carried a newspaper under each arm. The man turned his head and swore at Trevor as he passed by. Trevor didn’t know what it was that he did besides just being there, walking along the street at night.<br />
Trevor decided to stay close to the storefronts after that, avoiding anyone who moved along the street.</p>
<p>He heard a loud whack and stopped to look through a shop window. He was so close to the glass that he wasn’t able to read the large, colorful print, but saw a very thin man inside with an apron smeared light pink. The man was making precise, hard chops at a thick cut of beef on the table in front of him. It was beef, Trevor knew, because of the way each rib bone was spaced by a quarter-inch, the length of the bones, how they curved more at the top. Trevor had never watched a man butcher a cow before as he and his father only raised the cattle and sent them to the slaughterhouse when the time was right.</p>
<p>Trevor watched the butcher, knowing he should look away, but couldn’t get himself to do it. The butcher chopped, then rotated the slab and came down again with the thick knife. With each swing, Trevor saw the patch-colored faces of the cattle at home, their pink tongues dangling, their rocky knees.</p>
<p>A glass shattered in the distance. It spooked Trevor to the point of jumping away from the butcher shop window. He looked down the street toward the sound and realized it came from the direction where the truck was parked. Trevor heard a piano playing up ahead. The music was coming from the Charles Ray Saloon, and Trevor walked that way, a little nervous about it, but he was itching to get back to the truck. Men were outside the bar with glasses of beer and tumblers of whiskey, and they stood holding their drinks at their stomachs. Trevor saw a barman on his hands and knees, sweeping the broken pieces of glass into a pile. One man put his maroon fedora on a thimble-nosed woman and took it right back off when she reached for the top of her head to adjust it.</p>
<p>“Well, a young boy,” one of the men shouted as Trevor drew closer to the bar.</p>
<p>All of the faces outside turned to Trevor. They seemed like mean faces to him, men with dark moustaches that covered so much of their face their mouths couldn’t be seen. Their eyes couldn’t be seen either under their pulled-down fedoras. Trevor’s father had always said you could know a man from the first meeting if you could get a good look into his eyes.</p>
<p>“Come on over, boy,” another man said. Trevor put his hands into his pockets and crossed the street to the other side. As he crossed, the crowd outside the bar hurled swears and boos in his direction, but Trevor kept on toward the truck, hoping his back would be a strong enough wall to keep the people away.</p>
<p>Even a few hundred paces away, Trevor could still hear the laughter of the men outside the bar. It was too loud and rude and overwhelming for him, all of it spilling out of the bar and into the street.</p>
<p>Trevor was relieved when he got back to the truck. He felt optimistic about the city in the day, but believed it had turned on him with the night, had put fear into his chest that rumbled down to his stomach. He sat on the truck bench and considered putting the keys in the ignition and driving away without James and Danny. He thought about it, but only briefly, because he knew his father wouldn’t back out on a promise, a deal, and though he was ready to leave, he couldn’t make himself go.</p>
<p>Trevor got out of the truck and pushed a thumb into the side of a tire and checked the pressure. He knew he needed to get home, and it was already darker than his father would have wanted. Trevor thought of his duty to his father, of the fact that though he sometimes wished to be anything but, he had been brought up a farmer and would die that way. He walked to the back of the truck and unwound the chicken wire at the hatch and wound it back tighter. He looked at his father’s kerchief that served in place of the gas cap, ran his hands over the kerchief and smelled the tips of his fingers. Something about the smell of gasoline fumes, the lost cap years ago, made him think of his mother, but he turned away, as if from the thought, and walked to the driver’s side of the truck where he sat down in the road, leaning up against the front tire well for support. He tried to draw a bicep in the dirt with his finger and make the muscle bend and break apart like the fighter’s did, but the lines were too thick for detail. Trevor brushed over his attempt and picked up loose pebbles instead and shot them across the road with his thumb.</p>
<p>In the distance down Locust, he heard the rants and calls of James and Danny. He saw the brothers skipping up the road, throwing punches through the air. Behind them, Trevor could hear faint laughter and yelling and the sounds of the people of Charles City having one too many drinks at the Charles Ray Saloon. And just behind all of that, beyond the music and the people and these two brothers coming at him so fast, their voices louder and their movements bigger as they drew closer, he could see his father at home, wringing his hands together, mumbling things to himself about rain and cattle and rooftops, and waiting patiently for his son to return home.</p>
<p>As Trevor drove back toward Alanthus Grove, the brothers went on and on about the fights. They talked about a fighter who had a wooden leg, about a spectator from the city who jumped into the ring and started beating a fighter with a cane because the loss cost the man a lot of money. James talked about blood and broken bones and swollen eyes. Trevor nodded all the while, but the stories didn’t interest him. He kept thinking of the fighter, trying to place him somewhere in his memory.</p>
<p>The engine started to click as if a small stone were rattling around inside. Trevor’s father had told him it was nothing to worry about, just one of the odd quirks that came with the truck’s personality.</p>
<p>“What is that?” James asked.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing,” Trevor said.</p>
<p>“Sounds like you have a broken-down engine.”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing.”</p>
<p>“Too bad you can&#8217;t afford a new truck. Pops said your stalks have been dead for years, and your cattle aren’t far behind. Your old man probably doesn’t know how to prepare the ground right. I set and tilled my mother’s garden in one afternoon a few years ago, and she said she’d never seen such rich vegetables in her whole life. He probably just doesn’t have the touch.”</p>
<p>Trevor lowered his head and gripped the steering wheel with his left hand. They were a few miles from the turn where he would drop the brothers off in town. He looked over at<br />
James sitting next to Danny, his arm hanging out the window.</p>
<p>“You hear me?”</p>
<p>Trevor placed his hand over the stick shift, squeezed hard, pumped the clutch and pushed the gas, changing into higher gear, shuffling back and forth as he increased the speed.<br />
He thought of James’s hand coming at him, up and over in a fist. The gears shifted. The wind was the only thing hitting him in the face.</p>
<p>“What the heck are you doing?”</p>
<p>Trevor breathed the cold night air, moved his head from side to side, avoiding James, avoiding everything that was coming at him. He came to a familiar turn in the road and knew the stretch exactly. He shut off the headlights, confident he could maneuver in the dark, and pushed the engine harder, racing past the fence posts.</p>
<p>“Jesus, are you crazy?”</p>
<p>Trevor punched the shift forward one more time, flying along the road as he pushed on the clutch and over to the gas: left, then right, left, then right. He could see very little in front of him and nothing behind him.</p>
<p>James reached for the wheel, and Trevor stomped both feet onto the brake pedal, sending the truck skittering along the gravel at an angle, almost flipping the vehicle. James and Danny were thrown against the passenger door, and Trevor braced himself, pushing hard on the steering wheel and using the strength in his legs to hold himself against the seat bench. They were a mile from the drop-off, but when the truck was finally at a standstill, the dust rising up all around, James threw the door open, pulling Danny along by the wrist, cursing Trevor and all farmers as the brothers ran off the gravel road and onto dry pasture land.</p>
<p>The rest of the drive was quiet. Trevor passed Elias Penserum’s land, but nobody seemed home, and the corroded barrel stood alone in the dark yard. When he got to his father’s property, he took his time rolling down the road, looking at the wooden posts as he passed them. He followed the barbed wire that traced the borders of the farm. Trevor tried to imagine it as it used to be: golden and swaying, the three square fields next to one another like the start of a natural quilt. As a small child, he used to wander beneath the stalks, dreaming of when he would be tall enough to reach the top husk. Now Trevor noticed a place where the fence needed mending, something his father mentioned but hadn’t gotten around to fixing. Trevor drove past the worn place, and then stopped the truck and got out.</p>
<p>The moon was high and bright up above, almost entirely full except for a small sliver, blocked on its edge by an unseen cloud. Trevor walked until his feet hit the hard earth on the edge of the field. He went back to where the fence needed mending and stopped. Trevor set his hand on a fence post as he had seen his father do on so many occasions, only this post was bent far out of its placement hole like something had knocked it real hard. He thought of what his father would be doing the next morning, ramming one of his bad shoulders into the post so it would stand up again, holding together its part of the fence.</p>
<p>As he continued along the bank of the road, Trevor saw about ten feet of barbs and cable hanging down, twisted around the straight pieces of wire. Trevor set his hand out to touch the wires, untangle a few so his father would have less work in the morning. He collected a little bit of the cable in his hands, careful not to cut himself, and was reminded of the bloody fingers of the fighter. He could see the fighter with a shovel in his hands, going around the dry land and digging holes in indiscriminate parts of the fields. Trevor saw him for the first time in a panic, his forearms splitting and un-splitting with each strike of the shovel, the tips of his bruised and bleeding knuckles, spending the energy of an entire day moving from one field to another, one patch to the next, scooping up dirt and creating holes, filling them back in when they didn’t reveal anything. What are you doing that for? The fighter looked up with sweat dripping from his straw hat, one strap of his overalls undone and hanging at his side. “There has to be water down here. It’s there, I know it. If I ever knew anything, I know it’s down there.”</p>
<p>Trevor drove the truck up near the house and pulled it in backward, the square nose facing east as his father had asked. He left the windows down so the night air would float in.<br />
He walked along the side of the house and over to his father’s tool shed. He thought of walking into the house, but the fighter was still on his mind. Trevor brushed his hand along the side of the shed, thinking it was late enough, and his father would be in the house having coffee at the kitchen table, pretending to read the paper.</p>
<p>Down the hill, Trevor heard a low moan. He followed the sound a little ways then stopped and retreated to the shadow of the shed. Under the blink of the stars, he saw his father standing at the barn, Elias Penserum’s double-barrel shotgun leaning up against the outside wall. Trevor watched his father as he dragged a small metal trough across the ground, and he felt guilty for leaving his father. His old legs trembled, and Trevor could see a curve to his father’s back as he grunted and knelt down to lift the trough. His father shook as he pulled the trough into his stomach, brought it up to his beltline and carried it into the barn.</p>
<p>His father breathed in deep as he closed the heavy doors, one at a time. A late-night fog was forming around the barn and the lower fields like a curtain, and his father took his hat off as if he had just realized it was dark and there was no reason to have it on anymore. He set it on a post along the gate and arched his back, his chest pushed toward the moon. His father went to the side of the barn, picked up the last grain bag and began dumping it over the fence, little kernels tumbling to the ground like golden teeth. He then made a clicking sound with his tongue, incorporating a soft whistle. Out of the darkness and the fog, the cows staggered over to the fence, some flopping down on all fours to eat.</p>
<p>Trevor’s father took off a leather glove and reached through the fence, walking down the line, his arm carefully set between the strands of barbs, running his bare hand over any steer within reach. Then his father walked to the barn and stood near the shotgun. There was a small open box on the ground at his feet, and he bent down, pulling two shotgun shells from the box and rolling them in his hand. Trevor watched closely, trying to feel the ache of his father’s muscles, the age of his bones, all that was his father. Trevor found himself moving forward, just reaching the front of the shed when he hit a patch of uneven dirt. His step faltered, and he kicked loose gravel against the wall, sending an echo down to his father, who looked up, startled, and closed his hand over the shells.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today is the one-year anniversary of the Conway High Massacre, as it has come to be called, and we—the nineteen surviving gunshot victims—have converged on the large desolate field where Travis Covington, 17, filmed his now-infamous video diary before opening fire on a pep rally in the Conway High School gymnasium, killing twenty-six. It is midnight, and the crisp night air is rich with the aromas of earth and grass and decay. Our feet send up a chorus of inelegant squishing sounds as we proceed into the mud, sidestepping pieces of junk deposited by neighborhood residents unwilling to make the trek to the dump across town: broken appliances, tattered furniture, mounds of old mildewed clothes. A graveyard of possibilities. With our eyes fixed on the ground in search of rusty metal scraps, we might appear to any onlookers like a search party combing the area for a missing person.</p>
<p>What we are looking for, however, is the baseball diamond-sized pond on the far side of the field where Travis used to practice shooting at beer bottles, setting them to float in the center by way of a small platform constructed from plastic containers. In the video, which he Fed-exed to WKLL News an hour before the attack, the viewer can see the bottles pop and shatter in mists of brown glass. In the wake of the attack, the footage went viral, attracting scads of gawkers to the site, eventually forcing police to cordon off the area until the traffic stopped altogether. Up until now we have avoided the field, partially for this reason, but mostly out of a childish fear that our presence might be met with the ghostly vengeance reserved for movie characters who have stumbled upon ancient Indian burial grounds.</p>
<p>Classes will end at one o’clock today for what promises to be a sobering commemorative assembly in the front of the school. The mayor will speak, and then a few words from student council president Jessica Schiff, and then principal Moody will call for twenty-six seconds of silence. We will be seated in a row of folding chairs at the front, dressed in our honorary CHS letter jackets, of course, hands folded in our laps like penitents, exuding the heroic poise that has come to be expected of us. Actually, it’s not so hard to understand why our classmates would like our scars to Mean Something, to “emblemize the triumph of the human spirit,” as one well-coiffed South Carolina senator phrased it. Who doesn’t want to rationalize their traumas, if only to preserve their conception of the universe as an ordered system in which righteousness and evil are easily distinguishable?</p>
<p>It is for their sakes, then, that we have kept the truth to ourselves: that there is no meaning to be gleaned from our scars, no arcane wisdom, only a cold, sinister reminder that at best everything is only temporary. Even us.</p>
<p>Maybe this is why our hands instinctively seek out our scars as we approach the pond, the calm surface, sparkling plaintively in the moonlight. Notice, for instance, how Emily Lepisto clasps her left wrist, feeling the twin dimples from the slug that left her unable to bend her fingers more than a few degrees. Or see Adam Kravski remove his Clemson cap and absently trace the mottled pink ridge running from one side of his head to the other, making his skull look like a Phillips’ head screw. Altogether we carry 5.8 pounds of titanium alloys in the form of cranial plates, bone screws, artificial knee caps, and spinal fusion cages. So far we have undergone a total of seventy-one surgeries to repair punctured lungs, perforated bowels, temporal bone fractures, cerebral contusions, pulmonary lacerations, intracranial hematomas, arteriovenous fistulas, hemothorax, periocardial tamponade. Three of us have suffered neurological impairments that, while thankfully having no effect on our cognitive abilities, will prevent us from ever driving again. One of us is now blind in one eye.</p>
<p>The most iconic clip from the video diary features Travis standing with his back to the pond, dressed in a black t-shirt and cargo pants, clutching the weapon, a Bushmaster .223 semiautomatic rifle purchased online with a fake ID, to his tawny chest. <i>This is my manifesto</i>, he says robotically into the tripod-mounted camera. <i>For too long I have been ridiculed and tormented. Now the guilty must pay, the fakes and the liars. You brought this on yourselves</i>.</p>
<p>It is this clip alone that has allowed him in our memories to take on the impossible dimensions of a mythical figure—half human, half speculation, a stunning contrast to the nervous, lanky, fair-skinned boy we’d see skulking through the halls like a death row inmate on his way to the gas chamber. He was never very popular outside of his cohort of friends, with whom he usually spent his lunch hour in the AV lab playing Jenga; with their bad skin and anime t-shirts, they all seemed interminably trapped on the edge of adolescence in a way that made them outcasts, foreigners amongst the rest of us. Beyond this, we knew almost nothing about his personal life, other than that he had an older sister, Tori, who had graduated before any of us had started high school but whose promiscuity remained something of a legend amongst the students (she was rumored to have once taken part in a house party game to see which of five girls could fellate the most boys in a half hour and, as a consequence, had to have her stomach pumped of semen; that no one was ever able to verify this did not stop us from trading the story time and again like gospel). His parents, we learned after the attack, had been divorced for most of his life; his mother was a paralegal in Conway, and his father had a wife and two other children and owned a four-wheeler dealership in New Orleans.</p>
<p>But it’s the seemingly innocuous memories of Travis that have taken on the most retrospective weight in our minds. Whitney Smith remembers when he chose <i>Mein Kampf</i> for his end-of-the-year research project in sophomore English, and how annoyed Janice Arendale was when it took first prize in the annual CHS Writing Contest, beating out her sonnet about her family trip to Mexico (<i>He only chose that book to get attention</i> she was overheard complaining to a classmate). Kevin Molarno recalls the two straight weeks he wore sunglasses for no apparent reason, and how he used to draw flames on his tennis shoes. Brian Vick remembers when, during a fetal pig dissection in his sophomore bio lab, he began to dry heave into the sink and had to be escorted into the hall by Mrs. Odell, where he spent the remainder of the period sobbing hysterically.</p>
<p>Maybe these were nothing more than the hallmarks of awkward adolescence—we were all teenagers, after all, gloomy in our own ways and terrified of what the world had to offer—but in our minds they now seem hopelessly laden with significance, like opportunities that only reveal themselves once you’ve missed them.</p>
<p>On the September morning in question, he strode into the gym with the rifle in his hands just as the dance team was finishing up a routine. “We didn’t know what we were seeing, not at first,” DeShaun Burgess would later comment in a CNN news feed. “We all thought maybe it was, like, part of a skit or something.” It was Coach Barnes, an Iraq War vet (the fact of which has received almost as much coverage as the shooting itself, not to mention whispers of a made-for-TV-movie option) who first realized what was happening. Leaping up from the bleachers, he yelled “Get down!” and then darted across the court toward Travis, presumably with the intention of tackling him. Travis, clad in the same black paramilitary garb he’d worn in the video diary, took aim and, with an eerie calm, shot the coach through the right eye. The man’s head snapped back violently as if yanked by an invisible string, and then he dropped to the floor in mid-step; at least three radio talk show hosts would make comparisons to the Kennedy assassination.</p>
<p>A chorus of terrified screams rose up from the bleachers. Students flooded the floor all at once, clamoring for the exits, tripping and trampling each other, despite the teachers’ frantic attempts to corral them into the halls. The thick pops of the rifle resounded throughout the room, big as planets, while all around us it seemed bodies were collapsing unceremoniously, shredded by gunfire. The scorched smell of cordite, the panicked tang of sweat. For some of us, like Katie Wilkes, the blasts hit with enough scalding force to send us flying off our feet. Others didn’t even realize at first that they had been hit, as in the case of Doug Castalabri, who, propelled by adrenaline and fear, assumed the blood on his shirt was someone else’s, until once outside the building he noticed the dime-sized hole in his abdomen.</p>
<p>Altogether, Travis Covington fired off 74 rounds in approximately 3.2 minutes before turning the gun on himself. Ballistics reports would later describe the shooting pattern as “random and uncoordinated.” The video diary was aired by every major news network in the country, and Travis, who had made a science of going unnoticed for most of his life, the same kid who hadn’t had the stomach to make it through a fetal pig dissection, he became the most popular search term online for nearly four weeks straight.</p>
<p>As for possible motives, people have suggested maybe video games drove him to it, or the absence of his father, or milk hormones, or perhaps even his ADD—the kind of paltry straws people are prone to grasp at in these situations, but you can never really know a person, not in the way we would like. And that’s the worst part, honestly, trying to find a singular cause, knowing all the while that such things don’t exist. Aren’t we naturally predisposed to believe, despite all reason, that tragedy serves some higher moral function? Isn’t that what this afternoon’s assembly is all about?</p>
<p>But no: tragedy has the same point of origin as everything else, and searching for it only makes you understand how little your own survival actually accomplishes.</p>
<p>And so this is why now, standing at the mucky edge of the pond with the reeds swishing gently against our ankles, we begin to undress, each of us without a word, because what do we have to hide now? The cool air slides over our skins like strangers’ fingertips in a crowd, arousing the fine hairs on our arms and legs. Then, leaving our clothes in piles in the grass, we wade chastely into the frigid water.</p>
<p>In the brittle moonlight, our bare bodies glow spectral, our scars rendered practically invisible. Could this be all that healing amounts to, outlasting whatever you thought was keeping you safe? Moving farther out into the pond, we think about the video diary<i>. </i>We remember the footage of Travis’ target practice sessions, and we imagine the bottom of the pond as a vast carpet of glass shards waiting to slice the feet of unsuspecting swimmers. Just like the childhood monsters beneath our beds. That’s where the danger always lives, at the bottom of everything. Hidden, but closer than anyone would like to believe.</p>
<p><i></i><i>You brought this on yourselves.</i></p>
<p>Now we lie back in the water and close our eyes and drift listlessly out toward the center of the pond. We are alone here and the night is silent save for the trilling of crickets and the wind against the grass and the water lapping gently at our goose-rippled skins. We float like corpses, the nineteen of us, wholly exposed, limbs splayed like the points of stars as we wait for whatever is beneath us to reveal itself.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Say our man is pissed—literally,<br />
he’s pissed himself, thrown from the trunks<br />
where he and five others clung.<br />
Towering pine-light, his top hat smashed—<br />
the other passengers yell for the driver.<br />
“Yellibama,” he remembers a wagonload<br />
of slaves calling it, whether for the goldenrod<br />
or the brick-clay coating everything<br />
or the pain of crossing this stopgap<br />
between rivers, he couldn’t say<br />
(they meant the mulattoes).<br />
Here, where soldiers baited the natives<br />
to dance naked for whisky, federal,<br />
he’s come to see, means inexorable<br />
over sand and swamp. A log-house<br />
beckoned here and there, hectic,<br />
or one of the wretched inns<br />
called kettles for their one accommodation.<br />
What’s all this around him? Underclothes.<br />
The lady’s valise—she’s rumored to be a strumpet—<br />
has fallen with him and exploded.<br />
They picked her up at Sodom<br />
on the Georgia border. Among her articles<br />
are perfume bottles and a sheaf of letters<br />
penned, no doubt, in as many rough hands.<br />
He endeavors to dry out and walk<br />
the rest of the corduroy road,<br />
the slick log ribs laid out with the order<br />
of corpses after battle, though the mosquitoes,<br />
legion, descend like Romans.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>M’Comie Mor, 7<sup>th</sup> Chief of Clan MacThomas, Perthshire, died in 1674, after his heir<br />
</em><em>and next-best son were  killed in a skirmish with Airlie’s Royalist allies.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Say he outlived his earthly rising stars:<br />
Ascendant when he rode in Montrose’ wars;<br />
Yet brighter blazed in Cromwell’s glory years</p>
<p>When he bought Lord Airlie’s lands and Barony.<br />
Then the lintel stone on M’Comie’s manse vowed he<br />
With God’s prized help would overcome envy—</p>
<p>Not his, but that in rival Airlie’s eyes.<br />
Did God withdraw His aid, when Cromwell died?<br />
Twelve years M’Comie Mor fought Royalist fines</p>
<p>And raids that bled our clan.<br />

The mightiest stag, the lord of swords and glens,<br />
Now slashed, now bled by weasel-snouted men!</p>
<p>As we grapple stones from broken castle walls<br />
To build for meaner needs, so let me haul<br />
This lesser net of rhyme: our clan was small;<br />
Great M’Comie made us great; with him we fall.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New Shoes</p>
<p>You’re on your hands and knees, looking side to side beneath the tattered bus seats.  In front of you are new white tennis shoes, size three or four, and above them frayed and yellowed socks, and above the socks a young girl’s thin brown ankles, like chocolate-painted bones.</p>
<p>What else?</p>
<p>Other brown ankles, other shoes, but none are this close, this bright, this white, this new.  Metal bus-seat poles bolted to the black, filthy floor line up into the near distance like centipede legs.  But why are you on the ground?</p>
<p>Follow the images.  Remember.</p>
<p>You’re five, riding in the front of the school bus your mother drives every day through the Pine Chapel projects of Hampton, Virginia.  She is in her late-20s, pregnant with your brother.  The two of you are the only white people on the bus.  Behind you are about 50 of the poorest African-American kids in the state, kindergartners to eighth graders.  Each weekday morning and afternoon in 1976, only a few years after the last desegregation lawsuits, you sit by yourself in the first loose, spring-creaking chair behind Mom’s driver’s seat, legs dangling, listening to the talk, the laughing, and the cursing of the black kids.  You now know the words motherfucker fuck you bitch dick coochie ass faggot shit.  Language is a marvel (coochie?)—almost a solid material for building thought, memory, fantasy.  Most of your life is in your own head.  Such a good boy, people say.  So quiet.  But your mind is a rapids, anything but quiet.</p>
<p>Perhaps you’ve dropped something—a coin, one of the plastic toy figures of Batman or Aquaman you always had with you then, something—and now you’re on your hands and knees to pick it up.  You can see all the way to the teal, steel back of the bus.  But it’s these shoes that draw your eye.  Cheap, white, new.</p>
<p>Shoes have meaning.  Shoes tell a story.  Not how you think, of course, not at five, but something you seem to know because the teenage boys in your neighborhood, a white working-class neighborhood with poor black neighborhoods nearby, wear blue Puma Clydes, or bright white Adidas Stan Smiths with three green stripes, or blue and yellow Nike running shoes with tan knobby soles.  They parade these shoes, they runway-fashion-stroll them; every day you can see the boys belong together because of their shoes.  There are other things that connect them together as well—medium-length, feathered hair parted in the middle, T-shirts screen-printed with words like “Cheap Trick” and “Foghat” and “Jethro Tull” and “Pink Floyd,” their white skin.  But it’s the shoes that really mean, or so it seems, and it is cheap canvas shoes, what the teenage boys call “butter cookies,” that can truly damn a person, subject them to the cruelest words, bullying.  Your mother drives a school bus.  Your father works at the nearby shipyard.  Money is tight, your family never has enough (none of which do you know or understand), but you wear Nikes and if you didn’t you would be trash like your neighbors the Heeleys.</p>
<p>So when you get up from the bus floor—maybe with a plastic Batman in hand—you look back at the girl, at her face, then the older boy sitting beside her—her brother, you think—then the girl again.  She does not look you in the eye.  Her glasses are thick, plastic, cheap; her downcast eyes are magnified like a fish in the corner of an aquarium, like a squeezed balloon.  She is small, skinny.  About your age—five, maybe six.  Not clean.  Her black hair is coarse, wiry almost, parted in the middle with two tight braids drooping like weak stalks from the root of her head.  You would like her to look at you.  For the first time on this bus, you have something to say to one of the black kids.</p>
<p>Before you got your Nikes, before your mother relented to your begging for Nikes, the older boys in your neighborhood laughed at your shoes every day when they walked by you as you rode your yellow, plastic skateboard with the translucent, rubber-cement-colored wheels on your short driveway and the thump-tump uneven sidewalk in front of your house.  They said your mother drove the nig taxi.  They said, Check tike’s kicks or nice moccasins ke-mo-therapy then laughed, pushing each other.  You didn’t understand exactly what they meant, or why your white canvas shoes from K-Mart that your grandmother bought you were such a joke, but you felt the sting from their comments, their laughing, went inside.  No more skateboarding? said Mom.  Nah, you said, then sat on the flowered couch in the small, dim living room in the silence and the tea-stain light and the boredom (time felt so big at five, like an ocean to swim through, like having your eyes open while you slept, the hours a dark, unmoving sludge).  You looked down at your shoes.  Such crap crap shoes.  Butter cookies.  But then Christmas came and you wanted only one thing and you got your blue Nikes.</p>
<p>You’re leaning over the back of your seat now.  You and the black girl and her brother are face-to-face inside the roaring tunnel of the bus.  Did you have meanness in you as a kid?  Hard to know, really, since the child’s mind is the adult’s story, a thing you’re making on this laptop, a fiction we tell ourselves to grant some meaning to our pasts, but you remembered the older white boys laughing at your shoes, celebrating a new thing wrong with you.  A hurt thing wants to hurt.  That much you know.</p>
<p>You say only two words: nice shoes; then you laugh, your best neighborhood cool-kid derisive—like spitting on those embarrassing, no-brand shoes.</p>
<p>The boy beside the girl, her brother, is the “bus monitor.”  He helps your mother keep control of the violence, which hums in the air some days.  (Your father says the poor will fight to the finish over scraps, can be murderous over wounded pride, will steal useless things because useless things are still one notch up from nothing at all, and he does not like that your mother cannot find a better, safer job—the grocery store, helping out at a pre-school—that his low salary reduces freedom, forces your parents to make choices they don’t want to make.)  The girl’s brother is like your mother’s fight cop.  Mom says he is a gentleman, going somewhere.  “No fights” is her one remaining rule.  Wanna fight? he says to kids, standing up, eyeing them.  Get off the bus in the projects and kill each other.  Nobody cares.  Police don’t care.  Save their ass a bullet.  But no fighting on the white lady’s bus.</p>
<p>He scowls at your laugh now.  You think he must share your opinion of the girl’s shoes—you assume everyone understands that she should be wearing Nikes, not those sad $2.99 K-Mart specials.  This is inviolable logic.  You learned it from the white boys in your neighborhood.</p>
<p>He doesn’t laugh.  Instead he leans in toward you.  You look at him, listen.  You’re still smiling.  He helps your mother.  He can be trusted.  He looks at his younger sister, who sits with him every day, her new shoes, which still smell of pressed rubber and canvas, of the caved-in box they came over in from China.  Quietly, so your mother cannot hear, he says, What are you laughin at you little white motherfucker?  I bought them damn shoes.  I’d take off one and beat your little ass with it, bitch, your momma won’t sitting right there.  Turn the fuck around ‘fore I slap your face.</p>
<p>Little electric shock goes right through your forehead and all around inside your skull, staticking every thought.  You turn around.  Heart a marcher’s snare.  You hold your picked-up toy, Batman or Aquaman, tight in both hands.  You cross and re-cross your shins, as if to hide your expensive shoes.  Too scared to even cry.</p>
<p>At home you lie sock-footed on the flowered couch and watch Tom and Jerry torture and terrorize each other.  You do not mention to your mother what happened on the bus, what the girl’s brother said.  The next day, walking out of the slappy screen door of the house for the morning route, she asks why you aren’t wearing your new shoes.</p>
<p>Confederate Flag in the Grocery Store</p>
<p>The back of a grocery store.  This is now.  In New England.  Florescent lights glaring in the glass doors of the refrigerated foods section, making yellow window eyes that follow you as you browse.  Price tags.  Special! Special!  Labels of every color facing you.  Pink, green, orange.  Red, blue, red, blue, red, blue.  And your mind, your memory, suddenly goes back, and back, and back.  And this now loses its grip altogether and becomes Virginia decades ago.</p>
<p>You are looking at a young man named Jimmy, a crabber from Hampton.  He is bow-legged, in jeans and a red flannel shirt and a filthy, tattered-billed baseball cap.  You look down at his white work boots, the creek-mud splotches like coffee stains, back up to his sun-toughened, wind-cracked face.  He is 20, 21.  He looks 35.</p>
<p>He’s buying dinner maybe.  No, he’s buying, more precisely—some clarity now—milk and bread, and your memory—or the raw images from your memory (glare of light, rainbow of labels, squeak of boots on white, tile floors)—shifts from the back of the grocery store, the dairy section, where he looks at you and then turns quickly away, embarrassed—but you don’t know why yet—to the front of the store, the checkout line, where he is paying for his groceries with food stamps, which surprises you because you think, as a teen (you must have been a late teen, maybe 18), that local fishermen and crabbers make a decent living.  (At this moment in life, in the quick sliding of time, you think many wrong things.)</p>
<p>You know Jimmy from little league sports, though he’s two or three years older than you.  Embarrassment speeds his heart, and the skin on his neck pinks as you intrude on this transaction of food and food stamps when you stand too close in the line behind him.  Like getting behind someone buying tampons or hemorrhoid cream or flavored condoms at the drug store.  Pretend you haven’t noticed.  Look at the magazines in the cheap metal racks:  An actor’s secret battle with pain medication; cellulite solutions; 7 tricks to please your man; lose weight having sex—and look great!</p>
<p>Jimmy pulls a patch of a Confederate flag from the back pocket of his jeans.  It’s about the size of a playing card, edges frayed, but still bright red and blue, and he looks at you and smiles and says hey man long time and then says you should put the patch on your jean jacket if you want to let everyone know how you feel about blacks, though that is not how he says it, of course, that is not how you will really remember it, of course.</p>
<p>Here is a young white man, still with the gestures and bashfulness of an insecure boy, using the Confederate flag to leap over the fact that he is working poor and needs government help to eat, that he feels different in the bright lights of the store when he holds the food stamps, when he passes them to the cashier, inferior and weak and hopeless.</p>
<p>You won’t remember how you reacted to Jimmy’s offer of the Confederate flag patch, whether you took it or not—you probably did; caught off guard catching someone off guard, the hesitance and feeling-whiplash of that kind of moment, why wouldn’t you have?—but you will remember his blushing face, remember how desperate he looked, wide-eyed, caught up and contained in his shame, wanting more than anything not to be poor, to be better than somebody, anybody.  The last, defensive thought of so many of the poor white Southerners from your boyhood:  At least I’m not black.</p>
<p>Your son—back in the now now, back in New England, which feels like a different country—says, ready Dad? and you say yep and, milk jug in hand, leave the memory in the back of the grocery store, reminding yourself to write it down later.</p>
<p>Bullet Hole</p>
<p>Looks like your asshole.</p>
<p>Your neighbor Rodney Dean said that—you think—or maybe his older brother Kip.  One of them.  But you remember staring into the bullet hole in the car’s driver’s side door, six inches below the window, a few inches forward from the door handle.   Rodney is thirteen.  Kip is eighteen, and this is his metal-flake blue Chevelle in front of you, in the Dean’s cracked, weed-sprouting driveway.   You’re seven.  Nineteen seventy-seven.  Holiday season.   (Lay down the facts without literary fuss—make it pretty later, if you must.)  You’ve come next door to hear the story of the shooting, because this house, this family, this junk-strewn yard—storyville.</p>
<p>For instance:<br />
The earth was made by God in six days about six-thousand years ago.<br />
Cutting your hair if you are a woman is a sin.<br />
Showing your legs if you are a woman is a sin.<br />
Wearing pants instead of long dresses or skirts if you are a woman is a sin.<br />
Talking to a strange boy if you are a girl is a sin.<br />
Men can punish women, in public, physically, for their sins.</p>
<p>You have seen the father, the snaggle-toothed, wrinkled mechanic, the amateur Southern Baptist evangelist, beat each of his four daughters with a belt or a switch in the front yard (his four boys, too, but that seems less odd to you because you yourself have been beaten with a belt until you couldn’t breathe).  We live in God’s dominion, according to Mr. Dean, and the chosen shall lead us into being a fully Christian nation, not one filled with communists and dope fiends and queers.  Also according to Mr. Dean:  The black kids in the neighborhoods nearby are like roving platoons from an enemy army.  Whites made this country.  It is a white, Christian country.  Whites must take it back.  In Jesus’ name.  Amen.</p>
<p>Looks like your asshole.  All wide and blown-in like that, you hell-fire faggot.</p>
<p>So now you get the story (there you are, the listener, hands in dungaree pockets) but have a hard time following the plot.  Act 1:  Rachel, the middle girl, fourteen, went into the Pine Chapel projects by herself because she had a friend from her class who lived there.  The friend was black.  She knows not to go there.  She goes anyway.  The friend had an older brother and some cousins and maybe strangers living with her and her grandma.  Someone on the school bus told Rodney, the younger brother, that Rachel had a black boyfriend.  Act 2:  Big joke on the bus, repeated over and over:  white girl, black boy.  Rodney told Kip but didn’t tell his dad.  Act 3:  Dusk came.  A cold night.  Kip went out in his Chevelle, picked up some friends—two, three; you don’t clearly hear this part—and they drove through Pine Chapel with bats and crowbars.  They drank beer after beer and got braver.  Black teens on the corners watched them roll by once but not again.  Second time Kip’s friend started yelling.  Another of Kip’s friends flashed a pistol.  Then from the other side of the road a loud bang, driver’s-side door pinging like a shot beer can.  Right then a gang of twenty, thirty project kids come running around the corner, shadows under the street lights, and Kip and the boys are burning rubber and back home in a few minutes.  Act 4:  Rachel arrives home, an hour late and after lying about where she went.  No boyfriend, just a friend, a girl, yes a black friend but we had a project to do.  I promise.  I promise.</p>
<p>Now is Act 5:  You think you understand.  Maybe you don’t.  Kip and Rodney are still talking, half joking, half fighting.  You watch.  The thing you must do in life, you understand, is pay attention, follow along.</p>
<p>Here is Mr. Dean with his pepper crew cut, his missing teeth, his gray, cracked fingers, pushing his daughter Rachel by the neck out into the yard, to the car.  You see that? he shouts.  See that?  She says, Yes, she does, she does see it, but she only went to do a project for school and Kip didn’t have to come after her and drive around like that with music blaring and his friends shouting out the windows at the people who live there.</p>
<p>Mr. Dean slaps the back of Rachel’s head and her never-cut hair whips like a clothes-lined dress in the wind.  All because of your evil ways, Mr. Dean says, pointing at the bullet hole with one hand and vice-gripping her neck with the other.  Stay with your kind, he repeats as the swinging starts up again.  You and Kip and Rodney look on as their father beats Rachel with the force of worship.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In this dismal niche, once waterfront before<br />
the dam, transients and those who stay too<br />
long, drink to blessed numbness or oblivion.<br />
Cold, grey, unchanging. Rooms by the day<br />
above the bar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An ill-starred ship lends its name to this neon<br />
aquarium. Strong drinks, hard winters.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was a woman. What seems, what is.<br />
Her lover fell through a trap door. Oh<br />
willow, willow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <i>Desdemona</i>—inbound from San<br />
Francisco—ran aground. Gave up its name<br />
one new year’s day to shoals and shifting<br />
sands north of the channel, where ocean and<br />
river oppose and churn.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sixteen million Chinook once ran this river,<br />
before the dam. Before loggers, trappers,<br />
fishermen. Draft horses, stabled offshore in<br />
barns on pilings, seined the river bar at ebb<br />
tide. Belly-deep in brackish water, they<br />
hauled out great arcing nets of glistening<br />
silver.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A beauty ran off with an older man, a<br />
foreigner. The river’s headlong rush.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She was in love, and he proved mad. Oh<br />
willow, willow. They foundered in the<br />
turbulent churn.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Annie’s Tavern Dancers down the street’s<br />
been closed. The canneries are gone. Two<br />
fish swim in opposite directions. The<br />
Desdemona Club (four pool tables, well<br />
drinks, fries) serves spirits and asylum from<br />
the storm.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>“Not Baptize’d.  Pray Let particular Care be Taken’</em><br />
<em>of this Child as it will be call’d for Again…&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Mary Jane Kelley</p>
<p>Where are they now &#8212; four Ribbons narrow (Purpil, pink, blue &amp; yellow)<br />
tyed on yer right wrist and worckt with flowers by my own hand –<br />
whereon was writ My Name is Julia?  Also: a piece of blue silk<br />
pin’d on yer Breast, so as to find ye later among the hundreds<br />
of Exposed and Deserteds left at ‘Ospital.  I had silk then,<br />
fresh from Paris. I had printed calico, and camblet and cream linen.<br />
Also:  cherryderry, calamanco, and satin flowered all over<br />
with sprigs and daisies.  Not this linsey-woolsey, which never rustles.</p>
<p>The weather fleured the day I brought ye in, pink and bawling<br />
and wanting to suckle.  “She has had the Breast so let her continue<br />
to take Nurishment” I wrote in a note pin’d to yer Cap. Yet take her away.</p>
<p>Mr. Flemming tuck’d a playing card with Hearts abounding<br />
among her cloathing, made from my finer cut-down dresses,<br />
to let them know my Tenderness &amp; Care.  Be ye never</p>
<p>as pretty as yer mother, Julia.<br />
Better brown linsey than silks flowered over.</p>
<p>[*Inspired by “Threads of Feeling,” the Foundling Museum of London’s traveling exhibition of token fabrics and mementos left with foundlings so that the abandoned infants might be later reclaimed. Notes left with the infants or stitched on the colorful ribbons and fabrics have been incorporated, with small modifications. “The weather fleured” is from John Berryman’s Dream Song #8.]</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She still can’t use scissors.<br />
She sits on the edge of her bed,<br />
holds out her wrist, blood-beaded,<br />
a bungled bracelet.  <em>I wish I was dead</em>—<br />
a whisper.  Like Andersen’s mermaid,<br />
she’s bartered away her voice.<br />
Outside in the dusk,<br />
a bedlam of children’s noisemakers—<br />
the tide of cicadas in summer’s trees.</p>
<p>She can’t cut.<br />
While she sang from her heart<br />
to Disney’s Little Mermaid,<br />
the canary yellow pair for lefties<br />
mauled paper between serrated teeth.<br />
<em>Wandering free</em>, <em>wish I could be</em> …<br />
To spring her from K5,<br />
I sheared 26 pictures from old magazines:<br />
“A—aqueduct” through “Z—zinnia.”</p>
<p>She can’t cut straight.<br />
I caught her at 10,<br />
remaking a dress and belting<br />
with Britney: <em>Hit me baby one more time</em>.<br />
She stabbed the hemline.<br />
At her feet, two ragged arms,<br />
a ripped turtleneck.<br />
Right then I should have scoured<br />
the house for sharp objects.</p>
<p>I curl over her<br />
as though to reclaim her with my body,<br />
reconnect our pulses.<br />
She’s <em>part of that world</em> of Grimm,<br />
whose spindle will have its way,<br />
the princess seduced to a sleeping wheel.<br />
How to play?  She’s all thumbs.<br />
Her mouth opens.<br />
The song spins to dust on her lips.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Ann Arbor, I&#8217;m reading obits<br />
in <em>The Weekly</em> from Ohio hills<br />
a day&#8217;s drive southeast.  I know<br />
almost no one now, including Luther Hoops,<br />
<em>who loved the Lord and worshipped</em><br />
<em>many years at Fairfield Baptist</em>, which<br />
sits halfway up a ridge near Soderburg,<br />
four hundred German Catholic souls<br />
a little north of Wargo&#8217;s curve.<br />
Beer was legal there.  Still is.</p>
<p>Luther Hoops: navy gunner, Normandy survivor,<br />
36 years a dozer operator, Southern Ohio Coal.<br />
<em>Surviving are Lena, his loving wife of 62 years.</em><br />
<em>six sons and four daughters</em> &#8212; only one<br />
lives more than twenty miles away.</p>
<p>He farmed, carved wood, restored machines,<br />
<em>enjoyed family cookouts and golf cart rides</em><br />
<em>with his beagle, Jimmy</em> &#8212; where gravel roads<br />
bend in maple shade or straighten out<br />
along a field of beans.</p>
<p>In Amish country one summer<br />
I saw a plow horse lying dead in a field.<br />
Three of his thick-legged mates<br />
had arranged themselves around him<br />
and stared.  I thought they looked solemn,<br />
worried.  The fallen horse was another<br />
kind of thing now, and they wondered<br />
what to do.  They stood together and waited<br />
till the farmer came to coax them home<br />
with feed he shuffled in a bucket<br />
to make a good, familiar sound.</p>
<p>What do draft horses eat?  A farming wife<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>1.  Written in 1772 BC, Hammurabi’s Code contains the earliest known laws for justifiable execution.</p>
<p>2.  For example, if a man accuses another man of an injustice, the accused man will be plunged into a river, and, if innocent, he will rise to the river’s surface.  Conversely, unseen hands will draw him, if guilty, to the silt and darkness of the river bottom.  Should the man reach the river’s shore, the accuser will be put to death, and all he owns will be forfeited to the innocent man.</p>
<p>3.  Lex talionis, the law of retaliation, undergirds Hammurabi’s Code: “If a man put out the eye of another man, his eye shall be put out.”</p>
<p>4.  Deuteronomy, the fifth book of the Hebrew Bible, also advocates for lex talionis.</p>
<p>5.  Christ advocated for the law of forgiveness, as did Gandhi, and Martin Luther King.</p>
<p>6.  Mid-execution, Christ called out, “Father, forgive them, they know not what they do.”</p>
<p>7.  The word “excruciating” derives from the Latin word, “excruciates,” meaning, “out of the cross.”</p>
<p>8.  When Narayan Godse, Gandhi’s assassin, was executed by hanging in 1949, Gandhi’s two sons pleaded unsuccessfully for Godse’s life to be spared.</p>
<p>9.  King’s assassin, James Earle Ray, evaded execution with a guilty plea, which he later attempted to recant, and then died in prison from complications of hepatitis C.</p>
<p>10.  Robert Kennedy, when telling a gathered crowd in Indianapolis of King’s death, read aloud a poem by Aeschylus.</p>
<p>11.  From a podium erected on a flatbed truck, Robert Kennedy stayed the swelling anger of the crowd: Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget, falls drop by drop upon the heart…</p>
<p>12.  His own assassin, Sirhan Sirhan, was sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted to life in prison when the California Supreme Court invalidated all pending death sentences in 1972.</p>
<p>13.  As bodyguards and crowd members attempted to subdue Sirhan Sirhan, a seventeen-year-old busboy named Juan Romero cradled Robert Kennedy’s head and placed a rosary in Kennedy’s palm.</p>
<p>14.  When Robert Kennedy addressed the crowd in Indianapolis, he spoke in public for the first time about his brother’s assassination.</p>
<p>15.  Five years prior, while his dog Sheba waited in the car, Jack Ruby, on national television, executed Lee Harvey Oswald with a snub-nosed Colt .38 revolver.</p>
<p>16.  Sentenced to death and awaiting a new trial, Jack Ruby was executed by pulmonary embolism brought on by lung cancer.  Ruby and Oswald both died at Parkland Hospital, the same hospital at which John F. Kennedy had been pronounced dead.</p>
<p>17.  Jacqueline Kennedy introduced Robert Kennedy to Aeschylus’ writing when he was grieving the death of his brother.</p>
<p>18.  Aeschylus, the father of tragedy, believed that knowledge arises from suffering.</p>
<p>19.  In his plays, Aeschylus executes character after character.  Even Cassandra, whose ears were licked clean by snakes in Apollo’s temple so that she might hear the future, could not escape her execution by Clytemnestra.</p>
<p>20.  In 456 BC, Aeschylus himself, the legend claims, was executed when an eagle dropped a tortoise from the sky.</p>
<p>21.  Animals figure prominently in execution lore.</p>
<p>22.  In the Twelve Tablets of the Roman Law, the crime of patricide called for the condemned to be drowned inside a sack that also contained a dog, a rooster, a viper, and an ape.</p>
<p>23.  In an execution for sport, three hotel owners in Niagara, NY, in 1827, obtained a condemned schooner, decorated it as a pirate ship, filled it with animals, and sent it over Horseshoe Falls to the delight of 15,000 spectators.</p>
<p>24.  The boat (the <em>Michigan</em>) was supposed to contain “animals of the most ferocious kind, such as panthers, wild cats and wolves,” yet when the boat went over the falls, it contained only a buffalo, two raccoons, a dog, and a goose.</p>
<p>25.  In 1903, Thomas Edison, in an execution for business, electrocuted Topsy, a twenty-eight-year-old elephant from Coney Island’s Luna Park.  The execution was sanctioned because Topsy had killed three men over the previous three years.</p>
<p>26.  J.F. Blount, one of Topsy’s keepers, had tried to feed her a lit cigarette, and she lifted him with her trunk and dashed him on the ground.</p>
<p>27.  Hanging had been considered as a means of execution for Topsy, but Edison stepped in and suggested electrocution by alternating current.  To alert the public of the current’s danger, Edison insisted that the execution be filmed.</p>
<p>28.  George Westinghouse, Edison’s chief competitor, championed alternating current.  Edison championed direct current.</p>
<p>29.  To guarantee Topsy’s execution, Topsy was fed carrots laced with cyanide.</p>
<p>30.  One newspaper reported, “The execution was witnessed by 1,500 or more curious persons, who went down to the island to see the end of the huge beast, to whom they had fed peanuts and cakes in summers that are gone…”</p>
<p>31.  When Edison’s stunt couldn’t impede the rise of alternating current, Edison advocated for its use in the electric chair.  He even tried to make Westinghouse’s name into a verb.  To Edison, death by electric chair meant getting “Westinghoused.”</p>
<p>32.  In 1890, the first execution by electric chair was less than a rousing success.</p>
<p>33.  William Kemmler, a citizen of Buffalo, NY who killed his common-law wife with a hatchet, received 1,000 volts for seventeen seconds.  When the doctors noticed that Kemmler was still breathing, they increased the voltage to 2,000 volts.  Blood vessels ruptured under his skin, and the stench of singeing hair filled the chamber.</p>
<p>34.  When he heard of the debacle, George Westinghouse said, without irony, “They would have done better using an axe.”</p>
<p>35.  The word “electrocution” initially only referred to intentional execution by electricity, but soon encompassed accidental death by electricity as well.</p>
<p>36.  “Old Sparky,” the electric chair at Sing Sing prison, was used in all executions in New York State from 1914 to 1963.</p>
<p>37.  Willie Francis, in 1946, became the first person to survive the electric chair.</p>
<p>38.  An intoxicated prison guard in Angola, Louisiana incorrectly installed a portable electric chair named “Gruesome Gertie.”  When the switch was thrown, Willie Francis allegedly yelled, “Take it off!  Let me breathe!”</p>
<p>39.  His case went to the Supreme Court, and his lawyers argued that even though Willie Frances did not die, he had, in fact, been executed.</p>
<p>40.  The Supreme Court was not persuaded, and Willie Francis was re-executed successfully in 1947.</p>
<p>41.  Yet there have been successful escapes.</p>
<p>42.  Back in Niagara, New York, before the <em>Michigan</em> went over Horseshoe Falls, two small bears that had been placed on the boat leapt into the Niagara River and swam to Goat Island when the Michigan began to tear apart in the rapids.</p>
<p>43.  Rescued downriver after going over the falls, the goose also survived.</p>
<p>44.  In 1915, Wenseslao Moguel survived nine shots from a firing squad during the Mexican Revolution.  Presumed dead, he waited until the solders left and then crawled to safety, making a business from his mangled face and touring the country for the second half of his life.</p>
<p>45.  To conclude, there is this: If knowledge rises from suffering, what is to be made of Frano Selak?</p>
<p>46.  Frano Selak: the Croatian music teacher who escaped death seven times, who survived a train crash into an icy river, a fall from a plane where he landed in a haystack, a bus crash, two car crashes (one of which burned away all of his hair when fuel spewed from the air vents), being knocked down by a van, and, lastly, having his car hit by a United Nations bus as he turned a corner on a mountain road, catapulting him to the canopy of a tree as his car exploded below him on the mountainside.</p>
<p>47.  In 2006, Frano won one million dollars with a lottery ticket he bought in celebration of his fifth wedding.</p>
<p>48.  The ticket was the first he had ever purchased.</p>
<p>49.  In an interview, he said he was the happiest he had been in his life.  He said, “All I need at my age is my Katarina.  Money would not change anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>50.  He donated most of the winnings to charity and relatives, setting aside funds only for his hip replacement and to build a shrine for St. Mary, whom he viewed as the mother of all, whose own son, like Frano, had demonstrated power over the grave.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your first and only incision will be right over the sternum. All birds have a bald patch there. Blow lightly on the breast until the feathers begin to part and you can see the pale skin beneath.</p>
<p>Rest your finger there for a moment. Feel the bone your blade will follow. Make a wish, if you must, and then slice from collar to belly carefully.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>I used to keep the letters my father had written to me in a box with all of my other letters. There were three of them, all written before I was eight, on lined paper with a ripped, spiral fringe. He put them into the envelopes he sent my mother. Otherwise, they were empty, except for a check, always made out for $75. Sometimes the envelopes came from Alaska or Tahiti.</p>
<p>When I was a little older, if I saw the mail before my mother, I would feel the envelopes, to see if they were thicker than just-a-check.</p>
<p>You will need to cut the spinal column and trachea before you go any further. To do this, carefully work a small surgical probe between the skin and neck muscles at the very top of your cut. The curved tip is blunt, and if you advance it slowly, it shouldn’t tear the skin. Work it behind the neck until you can see it on the other side. Then slide the lower blade of a scissor along the steel. When you can see the scissor’s point, cut.</p>
<p>On larger birds, you may need to cut two or three times, blindly. This is why the probe is important: it keeps you from cutting through the back of the neck and beheading your specimen.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>I stayed at my father’s parents&#8217; house a few times as a child, usually when he was visiting, too. Even though he had a local apartment twice, I never stayed at either one. In the second apartment—which he took me to once for just a moment—I had my own room. I looked in through the darkened doorway and saw a bed and bedside table, no lamp, and then we had to leave.</p>
<p>I never stayed alone with him until I was in college. This doesn’t feel ominous, just disconnected.</p>
<p>His parents lived in a double-wide trailer, in the yard of a landlord I never met. I slept in his little brother’s old room.</p>
<p>After the neck is cut, you will slip the wings from their bones like a jacket.</p>
<p>To do this, repeat the following steps for each side: using your fingers, pinch the humerus below the shoulder joint and slide the skin away from the muscles like you are taking off tight jeans or panty hose.</p>
<p>Keep rolling the skin from the structure until you feel a boniness branch off from the ulna, just past what would be the elbow joint. This is the first primary feather. Use your fingernail to scrape it out—as you would a wasp’s stinger in your own arm. There will be a few primaries. Pop them from the bone one by one, and then cut the humerus close to the shoulder. Be careful not to cut through the skin. Both wings should be intact in the final specimen.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Uncle John had hundreds of comic books. I lay in that strange bed and read them through hours of sleeplessness. I preferred Casper and Archie to the superheroes because of the simplicity of their drawings. Hulk and Iron Man comics seemed busy and cramped; I couldn’t always tell what was happening.</p>
<p>My grandmother, his mother, was an Avon lady; she sometimes let me take home tiny lipstick samples of last season’s colors. She had an impressive collection of facsimile whiskey decanters shaped like famous people and a kangaroo skin my father had brought her from Australia.</p>
<p>My grandfather had a wooden leg and a glass eye. I was not told this, but discovered the prosthetics while snooping. I was told that he used to drink homemade corn liquor that he filtered through loaves of coarse wheat bread. He did this a long time before I was born. I don’t remember who told me that.</p>
<p>When both wings are free from the body, gently peel the back skin from the muscle. If it sticks, as can be the case with some freezer-burned birds, use the probe and scalpel to loosen or cut through the scab.</p>
<p>You will cut the legs by rolling the skin away from them as you did with the wings, but stop sooner, before you get to the scaled leg skin. Cut the thigh bone even closer to the body than you did on the wings.</p>
<p>Now pinch the tail ligaments and cut just above where you can feel the feathers end. If you cut too high, it will be a bit messy, but not unsalvageable. If you cut too low, the tail will fall off. This can’t be fixed, so err on the side of a mess.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>My father’s mother would fry trout in thick oil for dinner.</p>
<p>We ate peanut butter and mayonnaise on white bread for lunch. I asked that this sandwich be put in my bagged lunch, when I got back home to my mother.</p>
<p>For breakfast, my grandmother would make tiny pancakes for my father and me. He would put butter and jam on them, instead of syrup. He would roll them up like cigars and eat them with his hands. So would I.</p>
<p>The body, separated, should resemble a very small version of a fryer or turkey. Notice that the muscle tissue of songbirds, however, is all dark meat.</p>
<p>You will carefully collect tissue samples from the breast, heart, and liver now, and determine the sex of the bird. You may also need to collect stomach contents.</p>
<p>Follow the photocopied instructions for this step. Use the small plastic vials, and consider all samples dry unless your collections manager tells you to store them wet, as is sometimes the case with rare specimens.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>My mother never spoke ill of him, I want to say that. But the spaces between his contact swelled with meaning by the time I got to high school. First his father died, and then his mother. I asked him if I could come to her funeral, after I learned of it from my mother’s mother—her neighbor. I smoked Marlboro Lights in front of him for the first time that weekend.</p>
<p>I stayed with him and one of the women he married a couple of times, once in Spokane and once in Pleasant Hill, California. She had older children, cut his meat for him, and talked in a nasal, baby voice.</p>
<p>He didn’t travel overseas anymore, but would frequently overspend. During one visit, he bought a new car and a giant television. Then, he got a nosebleed and sat in the center of his bed staring into space. His wife said, “Go comfort him!” Their marriage may have lasted ten years. Maybe less.</p>
<p>The head is difficult, so take your time.</p>
<p>Start by pinching the neck and working the skin away from and over the back of the skull. When you get to the eye sockets, use your scalpel to carefully cut through the thin membrane that connects the lids to the eyes.</p>
<p>You will need to keep the majority of the skull intact, to maintain a natural shape, but the soft tissue should all be removed: tongue, eyes, brain. Use caution so that when you cut out the tongue, you do not damage the hinges that connect the upper and lower maxilla.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The last time I stayed at my father’s house, he was living alone in a near-bare apartment outside of Alameda, near a marina. We ate out, because the only thing in his refrigerator was a whole roasted chicken from the grocery store. He lamented my inability to cook. He showed me his cupped palm, full of old wedding bands.  My mother’s was not there, he said, as he clamped his hand closed and carried them back to wherever they’d been hidden. Did he think I might have asked for it? It broke, he said, making a joke of it.</p>
<p>I awoke the next morning in his (only) bed with his arm around me. I spent the rest of the week on the living room floor without comment.</p>
<p>The specimen will be used for study, it isn’t intended to seem life-like—keep that in mind as you finish. After washing and drying the skin, you will use cotton wrapped around a small dowel to replace what you have extracted. Use enough cotton to create a sense of fullness, in the eye sockets, in the belly.</p>
<p>Tie the legs together, so they do not splay, and attach the specimen tag using a square knot. Paint the ends of the string with clear nail polish. Then close up the original incision.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>After college, after my own failed marriage, he regained an interest in me. I tried to be polite when he came to visit me in Washington DC. I met him downtown, but did not invite him to my house.</p>
<p>A few years later, one of his girlfriends called me to say he was depressed and would I please call back later to cheer him up? He’d mentioned her once. She had a little boy, he’d said, whose name was spelled &#8220;Jesus.&#8221;</p>
<p>“It’s pronounced ‘hey-Zeus’,” he’d said.<br />
I know, I thought.</p>
<p>He had told me her name, but I’d forgotten it and so had hung up on her the first time she called, thinking it was a wrong number. She spoke very little English. The conversation was frustrating for us both. I didn’t call back.</p>
<p>You may be tempted to take your needle and thread and sew dozens of the smallest stitches you can, as though attention to detail could hide the hole you’ve made. Resist this urge. Everyone expects a hole in an empty skin. Dip your needle once twice three times and then pull the thread tight. It’s enough.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>When I stopped answering his emails, he would telephone. The calls came every year or so, between girlfriends or wives. Once, late at night in a Barcelona train station, I was confused by the time difference and answered my cell phone, thinking there must be an emergency. He was bored and lonely. He made a joke about how long my master’s degree was taking.</p>
<p>When I stopped answering the phone, he started to text. He always tells me first, that he’s broke, and second, that he’s single.</p>
<p>Before you position the bird to be dried, stick one straight pin through the base of the bill vertically from bridge to chin. Thread a small piece of twine through the nostrils and around the bill, using the pin as an anchor to cinch it tightly closed.</p>
<p>Use as many pins as you need to hold the specimen in exactly the position you want on the board. The head should be facing forward or slightly up, the wings tightly folded, right leg over left, and tail feathers spread just to the width of the body. With proper preparation, it will keep this shape through decades of routine handling.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Charles Russell likes to give Selene, who lives in the adjacent apartment, what he calls sonic displacers.  Even if friends are over, he commands silence in the room, then sits on his wooden barstool and listens through the drywall to Selene watching her shows.  Then Charles Russell holds out his hand a foot from the wall, sits up straight, opens his palm and pounds a single shock to the apartment next door.  Then he smiles, relieved, as if he has just undergone a pulse of electro-shock therapy and the bell jar has temporarily lifted.  “Wait,” he says to anyone in the room.  “Here it comes,” and seconds later, the phone rings.</p>
<p>Charles Russell picks up the phone, repeats her questions for comic effect.  “Have we heard anything?  A sound?  Did we hear a thud?  A thump?  Hold on,” he said, then asks aloud if Max has heard a thump.  “Max heard it, too.  You want to talk with him about it?”</p>
<p>An hour and a half later, Charles Russell repeats the routine.  It has become a kind of tic, like step counting, or measuring the angle of your food.  And it is an act that Charles Russell feels entitled to.  He moved to Gainesville with Max at the end of August.  Max had moved to Gainesville to look for like-minded musicians, start a band, land a contract, and Charles Russell had simply wanted to get out of Palm Shades.  At the end of high school, his parents had divorced, and he had been floating since, staying in house after house.</p>
<p>However, Charles Russell decided that he wanted to leave his mark in Gainesville.  He designed his own set-up with a Vox bass amp, BOSS signal processor, a Mini-Moog synthesizer, an array of flange, octave, delay and distortion pedals and a sequencer.  He generates his sounds using a banjo with modified tuning pegs, and he strings it up with round wound bass strings, using the a low E flat-wound string as a drone.  Charles Russell considers this rig an act of genius.  He considers it such an act of genius that he refuses to play with other musicians.  He refuses to even play songs.  While his roommate, Max, sits up in his room and plays guitar along with CDs, runs up and down scales or sits on the back porch writing songs, Charles Russell creates sound sculptures.  Each composition sounds abstract and full of shapes and colors, but he stresses to anyone listening that the sounds are controlled, that he can repeat any composition note for note.  He composes each piece, records them one by one on a TASCAM four track (using all four tracks with multiple mic placement), then rewinds the tape to the beginning, labels it, logs it and keeps the cassettes in an aluminum file up in his room, the only piece of furniture he owns other than a sleeping bag and a barstool.  He titled one of his compositions, “Young Boy, Mauled by Black Bear.”  He titles another, “Pig Breaks into Distillery, Gets Drunk on Moonshine and Discovers Gainesville Killer Sipping Brine in Baby Bottle.”  In September, he worked on a twenty-seven minute magnum opus to which he granted the title, “Space Shuttle Makes Love to Wife of Ronald Reagan.”  All of his compositions possess the strange quality of sounding exactly like the titles.</p>
<p>Charles Russell claims that what he has undertaken will grow like a seed outward, and within months, his mark will be made.  His performances will be in demand.  He believes with conviction that sonic images emanating from anywhere with enough distinction will cause curiosity to run amok.  Charles Russell claims he will end up performing his pieces at the Covered Dish, at the Hardback Café, at frat parties and record store openings and will get picked up by touring bands and present his genius to ten thousand seat arenas.</p>
<p>Charles Russell claims many things.  He also claims to have never had a cold.  He claims that he would look beautiful as a female.  He claims to know the secret to giving a woman a seventeen minute orgasm.  He claims that his sound sculpture compositions have the potential to turn Gainesville, Florida into a sonic Mecca, that his music will have the same effect for classical music that garage bands did for rock.  People will see.  Best thing was to get in on the ground floor.</p>
<p>But then in early October, someone knocked at the front door.  The woman introduced herself as Selene.  Her hair had the wiry texture of too many perms, as if one day each strand would break off and flake away.  Her skin bore the resemblance to a bird’s eye view of the moon’s surface, but lined with visible veins and dander.  She introduced herself as their neighbor.  She said she was a dental hygienist.  She told them she left the house while it was still dark, and she took classes at the university twice a week, at night.  She held a plate of hot dogs, stacked seven wide and three high.  She had cooked too many.  She had cooked so many, she said, that she didn’t know what to do with them all, and if they wanted, they could have them.  Charles Russell, blocking her attempts to look into the apartment, had thanked her, and he and Max did not consider until they had finished eating all of the hot dogs that perhaps she had not offered them all of the hot dogs.  They had eaten twenty between them.  That’s two packs.  Perhaps she had wanted to join them.  Perhaps she had wanted to eat with them.</p>
<p>After that afternoon, the phone began to ring.  Selene reminded them of her hours and her need for sleep and study.  Had they been making the sounds?  They had?  Could they stop?  By November, she had stopped asking and had begun telling them to stop.  By December she had begun threatening to call the police.</p>
<p>Charles Russell calculated the time that Selene had robbed of him and decided that the time could not be quantified, because it was not necessarily the amount of time that he had missed composing his sound sculptures, but the quality of time and the instances of discovery, both constructed and serendipitous sagacity.  What she had stolen from him was joy.  She had taken his joy and replaced it with cortisone and high blood pressure.  Charles Russell decided he would compact all of his playing time into neatly compacted sonic displacers.  “Watch this,” he had said to Max.  He sat up on the stool, held out his open palm and leveled it against the wall.  Charles Russell even recorded some of them to maximize the effect, setting two mics up for a stereo mix, then taping two contact mics to the drywall itself for texture and depth.  He recorded one, mastered it with just enough reverb to bring the vibrations back to life, then spaced each attack seven minutes, eight minutes and two minute apart to ensure realistic simulation.  He writes the title of the composition with a Sharpie on the cassette tape label: “Sonic Displacer for Undersexed Woman with Hot Dogs and Dander.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was born in 1981, my daddy wanted to give me the French name “Monique,” but he didn’t know how to spell it, and when he consulted with a nurse at the hospital there in our little town of Commerce, Georgia, she confessed she didn’t know how to spell it either. And so they guessed. The story of how I got my misspelled name is important to me because today I see my daddy’s ignorance on my birthday as a marker of the type of family I was born into: an uneducated one.</p>
<p>Neither of my parents finished high school. Momma left school when she was about nine years old and became a child laborer who picked cotton and worked on a chicken farm. Daddy made it as far as the eleventh grade. Unlike my parents, I was never forced to leave school or pick cotton.  And though I did not go to segregated schools like my parents did, I self-segregated myself from other people.</p>
<p>I think my language, my race, and my lower-class upbringing were the things that kept me apart from the kids at my school. Though I regularly spoke black vernacular at home with my parents and brother, at school my language was different. I learned early on that the world had a certain social order and particular language rules. One thing I learned was that Black English was to be spoken amongst black people who grew up in double-wide trailers like I did, and Standard English was to be used in education and the workforce. And while I learned all of this at an early age, my daddy never seemed to get it, or at least he pretended he didn’t.</p>
<p>“You talk so weird,” Daddy accused me. He stood in front of our kitchen door dressed in the green snowsuit that he wore as a uniform in the poultry plant where he worked. The suit had a few seams missing from wear and tear, and the bottom hem was frayed. “Half the time I don’t even know what you sayin’,” Daddy said, and as he pushed open the kitchen door and walked out into the black night I heard him grumble, “Hell, what chu think you is?”</p>
<p>Daddy’s intended meaning was clear: You are black just like I am, so why don’t you sound like it? I felt shamed by Daddy’s words, and what he said confirmed a suspicion I’d had for some time, which was that he thought I was talking down to him by speaking Standard English. Whenever we had those conversations about my speech, there was always a lot of eye-rolling and frustration on my part. I felt I should explain myself to Daddy, but what could I say? That his way of speaking wasn’t good enough for me anymore?  That I was ashamed to sound too black and too Southern? Instead of talking about it, I clammed up.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, Daddy liked to pretend my accent and diction had created a foreign language that he couldn’t comprehend. I think Daddy was just annoyed because I didn’t sound so much like him anymore. His theory was that I was “talking white” because I was influenced by the students at my predominately white school. This was not altogether true. The truth was that we lived in Jackson County, Georgia, a place where it was uncommon to hear Standard English, and nearly all of the kids at my school had a Southern accent. If I had truly planned to fit in with my classmates, I would have adopted a Southern twang, not an inclination toward standard speech. However, Daddy was right on one point— when I was younger, I used to speak vernacular with my family at home, but as I grew older my language changed. By the time I reached high school, my speech was much closer to a Standard American English dialect than anyone else’s in my family. I think the change in my speech was partly caused by the fact that I immersed myself in books. I was a lonely child, and reading books was one of few things that kept me from feeling so alone. Gradually, my Georgia drawl faded and I began to speak like the words on the page. And while my change in speech was partly brought about unconsciously, I can admit now that some of it was done purposefully. I knew how people degraded black speech and Southern speech, and I was afraid of sounding black and Southern.</p>
<p>At school, I felt alienated. While I did sometimes try to speak vernacular with the black students, some of those students judged me as not being ‘black’ enough. Karen did. She was a black girl in my grade who went to the same church as me.</p>
<p>“You a white girl trapped in a black girl’s body,” Karen said to me more than once.</p>
<p>At first I didn’t know what Karen meant, but then I noticed she usually accused me of being too white when she saw me off to myself reading a book or heard me use words longer than two syllables. I finally caught on that Karen associated reading books and using proper speech with being white. I never saw Karen read a thing, and her speech was far from what I would call proper. She had a distinctly black Southern style of speech, not the charming kind (à la Morgan Freeman), but the sort that made me want to get a set of earplugs. I could never admit to myself that I hated how she spoke—to hate it would be to hate a part of myself.</p>
<p>Karen and I could not be friends, and I think part of the reason was our different styles of speech. She was friends with the blacks who spoke like she did, and I think some of them considered me an uncle tom.</p>
<p>Aside from her accent, Karen’s behavior was also a big reason for our disconnect. After school, she’d go down to the east wing of our high school and have sex with boys in empty classrooms. I admired her, not for her cock-sucking, but because she did what she wanted and was unashamed of it. She seemed to enjoy what she did with those boys, and those boys loved it, so it was a win-win situation to me. While I admired Karen for her brazen boldness and authenticity, I was a virgin who was terrified of boys, even terrified of my own voice, and so I felt I couldn’t relate to her.</p>
<p>The qualities that I admired in Karen—confidence and genuineness—were the same qualities I admired in a lot of black people, especially the ones who spoke Black English. They had the attitude that they wouldn’t change for anyone else, and whenever I heard them speak I knew that they were simply being themselves, whether other people liked it or not. And while I admired the genuine style of black speech, I understood, even back then, that as a culture we shun Black English and accept the blacks who talk white. I cannot think of any powerful, well-respected blacks who speak Black Vernacular. Oprah Winfrey doesn’t. Barack Obama doesn’t. And if Oprah and Obama spoke like Karen, would they be in such powerful positions? Probably not.</p>
<p>In high school, my disconnect from Karen was representative of my disconnect from the other black students. Though I did speak vernacular with them, I suppose I didn’t do it well enough. Maybe I didn’t use enough double negatives. Maybe I couldn’t quite clip the ends of words like “door” and “store” crisply enough. I don’t know what the hell it was, but sometimes when I spoke to blacks, they would listen with their heads cocked to the side (the way a person might gape at something unusual). The strange looks they gave me were bad enough, but when those looks were mashed together with my shyness, it succeeded in crippling me. I rarely spoke unless spoken to, and even then my replies were tentative whispers. I started to hate my own voice.</p>
<p>As uncomfortable as I was with myself, I hated Ana’s voice even more. Ana was a Hispanic girl at my high school who tried to conceal her Mexican heritage. Though passing for white appeared to be her goal, her skin was too dark to be considered white, and so her attempts at passing were futile. Ana’s voice was so affected and high pitched and “valley girl” that even the white girls at our school would stare at her, and the few Mexican girls in our school wanted to kick Ana’s ass. I once asked two Mexican girls why they hated her so, and one of them responded with, “Because she say she is no Mexican.”</p>
<p>I had a Spanish class with Ana during my sophomore year. The other students in class asked her for help with homework and in-class assignments. Ana told them her Spanish was limited, and I think most people believed her until one day our Spanish teacher pronounced the word pharmacia (pharmacy) with the accent on the third syllable. Ana said, “I, like, heard that it’s, like, pronounced pharmacia (accent on second syllable). Like, I dunno, but that’s just, like, what I heard.”</p>
<p>The room went silent, and I felt the anger of about twenty students silently cursing Ana. I saw at least one pair of eyes roll. If Ana couldn’t help us with our homework because she didn’t speak Spanish, then how could she correct our teacher?</p>
<p>Ana and I were never friends, and so why do I care, even now as a grown woman, that she denied her heritage? I think it’s because I understand what it’s like to speak one way at home and a different way at school, and I sometimes wonder if other black people talk about me the way the Hispanic kids from my school talked about Ana. Am I trying too hard to assimilate? It’s a question I ask myself all the time. I examine my habits and all of my likes and dislikes for signs of too much milk in my bloodstream. My love of country music (Randy Travis, Dixie Chicks, Tim McGraw) counts as one point for the white team, but on the other hand I also like Sam Cooke, so that’s a point for the black team, right? Growing up, I was a fan of Kate Hepburn and black and white movies in general, and I see that as a point for the white team. And what about the books I’m reading? I’m a fan of Mildred D. Taylor and Roxane Gay (both black), but I definitely read more white writers than black. I blame my predominately white reading list on American schools. I cut my eyeteeth on the Western canon, but if I hadn’t been assigned so many Western writers in school, I doubt that I would read the canon as often as I do.</p>
<p>Not only was I fed a diet of mostly white writers in both high school and college, but I also grew up in a predominately white town, which whitewashed me even more since most of the kids I interacted with were white. By the unwritten social order rules, I could possibly have been friends with the poor whites since I was poor. I did have some casual friends from that group. I remember I went home with one of them to spend the night. Her name was Beth and she had a Southern accent typical of our region. She lived in a high-ceilinged house out in Madison County. A fat cat lazed around on Beth’s bed, and as we talked in her bedroom, Beth revealed a secret to me.</p>
<p>“I’m glad my daddy’s not home. I don’t know if he would allow you to spend the night here with us,” Beth said.</p>
<p>I wondered why not.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t really allow black people in our house,” Beth said. Her voice wasn’t hateful, just matter-of-fact.</p>
<p>That conversation marked the end of our friendship, and it was an awakening at the time. I was about seventeen that year, and I realized I had spent my time in grades K-12 ticking people off my list. I severed my relationships with black kids who spoke different from me and minority kids who acted “too white,” and the white kids who came from racist families. The thing about writing people off is that soon you look around and there’s no one there, no one to befriend.</p>
<p>During this friend crisis of mine, our household was the pity of my momma’s side of our family. Not that our extended family had much of a pot to piss in either, but my momma, my daddy, my brother and I were the most pathetic of us all. Our financial problems were worsened by the fact that my daddy loved his whiskey. More than once during my childhood, he had to be admitted into inpatient programs for substance abuse, which kept him out of work and caused Momma to struggle even harder to pay our bills. Momma often had to borrow money from her brothers and sisters just so we could afford to live.</p>
<p>During this time, I was given a box of hand-me-down sweaters from one of my older cousins. My favorite one was beige wool, and it had multi-colored argyle shapes across the front. I wore it often, and I was complimented on it. In my Advanced Placement (AP) English class, my sweaters were as nice as anything worn by my white, middle-class peers. I remember that my classmate Emma once said, “You have the nicest sweaters.” She was right. They looked and felt expensive.</p>
<p>One day, my black friend LaTonya was sitting near Emma and me in class. Emma made some comment about LaTonya being ‘ghetto’ or ‘hood’ or some other term often used to describe low-class blacks. I remember looking at LaTonya and wondering what was low-class about her. The only things I could think of were her speech and style of dress. LaTonya spoke like Karen, only not so loud or aggressive. LaTonya was also a bisexual who liked to wear baggy, man-style jeans and oversize t-shirts with sneakers or boots. I knew that LaTonya’s daddy liked to drink, probably not as much as my daddy, but he drank just the same. LaTonya was black and grew up in a double-wide, just like me. The only difference between us was that I sounded like a middle-class white girl and wore argyle sweaters, and LaTonya spoke like what would usually be heard in either of our homes and dressed less sophisticated. As a result of mine and LaTonya’s differences in speech and dress, Emma was kind to me but not to LaTonya. It occurs to me now that for a long time middle-class people like Emma have mistakenly assumed I shared something in common with them: a middle-class lifestyle.</p>
<p>Emma, along with most of the students in my AP English class in high school, belonged to the middle class white group. I was like them in that we all enjoyed books and dramatic movies. Maybe I could’ve been friends with them. Those students were friendly with me, but over the years I began to write them off. Some of them tended to believe that the Western world was ‘right’ and everything else was inferior. I saw this whenever they made fun of speech that was different from theirs. Most of them spoke Standard English. Very few had a Southern accent. Sometimes I wondered what they would say about my family if they heard my momma or daddy speak.</p>
<p>Another reason I felt distanced from my AP classmates was that I was dealing with poverty and my daddy’s drinking, so their concerns about prom and their detailed stories about their cats rarely interested me. I wrote them off based on the simple assumption that they were not poor and therefore could not understand me. Maybe I was wrong. Maybe they had alcoholic daddies like mine, or maybe their home lives were similar to mine in some way or another. All I know for sure is that as a teenager I didn’t think anyone in the world was suffering like I was. And when I thought about reaching out to the students in my AP class, I tried to picture a girl like Emma hanging out with me at our trailer—a place with holes in the floors that was heated by only a kerosene space heater in winter—and I couldn’t.</p>
<p>In an earlier draft of this essay, I wrote that I’m not so sure if I can be friends with middle-class whites. One of my friends, a girl who is both white and middle-class, read the essay and said that I should retract that statement. But I won’t take it back. I can’t. For a long time, I have reflected on what could possibly lead me to make such a racist, classist statement. Over time, I have come to realize that my insecurities around middle class whites comes from my resentment of social classes. I see my status as one that has been constantly marginalized. And there, sitting on the other end of the social spectrum, is the mainstream group, which I think is made up of middle and upper class whites. Even today, whenever I am in a room full of people, I am still very conscious of where I come from—the wrong side of that spectrum—and it makes me angry and bitter. Sure, I’ve had middle-class white friends before, but I have always kept them at a distance. I am a product of the environment in which I grew up. I don’t know that anyone can come through the type of poverty I grew up in and survive it completely unscathed and with no anger or meanness or resentfulness. Today, I can say that perhaps my paranoia around middle-class white people stems from being raised in a society where being poor is a source of shame. I think somewhere in the midst of my lower-class suffering, I began to unjustly blame the middle and upper classes. I can’t be friends with people who come from wealthier backgrounds because deep down I worry they will make judgments about me based on where I come from. Several times I’ve heard people use words like “trailer trash” to describe people like me. They used these classist, hateful labels in a way that was directed at other people, and they said it to me as if they thought I would understand, as if they assumed I grew up in a nice home like they did and would somehow agree that to come from a trailer makes someone less of a human being. This is not to say that all middle-class white people have this type of attitude toward the poor. In fact, I’m sure that many do not. And yet, my fear of the middle class and my insecurities around them are very real.<br />
*<br />
As an undergrad I took a course called American Speech, and it is one of the few classes I remember from all of my years in school. The class introduced me to the concept of language prejudice, which is basically the idea that we are all pre-judged based on the way we speak. I had been aware of that type of prejudice since I was younger, but I didn’t know the name for it, nor did I know that there was so much to be learned about language. It was mind-blowing.</p>
<p>My teacher spoke with an Appalachian accent. He was from North Carolina and admitted that when he first came into the academic world he was ashamed of his speech. I understood him completely. I was a child who felt I should conceal my family life from other students, even adopt a different way of speaking to keep them from knowing about the world I grew up in.</p>
<p>One of the most important things I learned in speech class is that there are no ‘good’ or ‘bad’ dialects, just different ones. Language is completely arbitrary. The accents we develop are all due to where and how we were raised and conditioned. Accents do not reflect our level of intelligence. Being born Southern or black doesn’t make a person stupid or less of a person.</p>
<p>Even after my newfound reassurance that my language was nothing to be ashamed of, I confess I am still sometimes self-conscious about the way I speak. When I decided to apply to graduate school in English, I worried that my language wouldn’t be good enough to compete or even stay on the same level as the other students. I was educated by parents who had only the bare minimum of education themselves, and since my education could not begin at home, I depended heavily on my school to educate me. But my high school was a public school in rural Georgia. The South is notorious for having school systems that are admittedly behind the rest of the country. My school was no different. We had low test scores, and no one tried to set the standard any higher for us.</p>
<p>For a long time I didn’t think I belonged in classrooms, and even now I am unsure if I do. Aside from my worries about language, I am also a person who likes to form my own opinions about things, and I sometimes think classrooms basically teach everyone to think alike. Right now I’m in graduate school, a place where some students elevate their teachers to god-like entities and try to express the same thoughts and feelings as their teachers. All of my classmates pretty much speak Standard English and everyone is politically correct. The vernacular I spoke with my family when I was younger is probably as foreign in our program as, well, students who are only one generation from cotton pickers. Sometimes I long to hear a strong regional accent in our cohort, and I wish my classmates would argue instead of always agreeing on the big issues concerning race and class and sexuality. I wish that more students in our academic program could be as genuine and unpretentious as my high school classmate Karen.</p>
<p>Right now I work as a tutor in our college’s writing center. I have tutored essays written by Southern kids and minority kids, and even when the content of their papers is good, I sometimes worry about their grades suffering because of their grammar and vernacular. A black boy whose paper was infused with Black Vernacular once came in for help. I stumbled through his paper, all the while tempted to tell him to think about how his white teacher would say things and then re-write it accordingly. Whenever I tutor those types of papers, I feel like I’m acting superior, like I’m climbing up into my ivory white tower and pulling out my little red pen and scratching the words “Whiten up,” across the tops of the students’ papers.</p>
<p>Some of you might argue that students should whiten up, that Standard English is more eloquent and better overall than other varieties of the language. But would you think that way if you weren’t taught to think so in classrooms? What if all of your teachers spoke with heavy Boston accents? What if all of your textbooks were written in the Boston dialect? What if every time you turned on the TV the newscaster dropped every other ‘R’? Would you still think that Standard English is superior to the Boston dialect? Probably not.<br />
*<br />
When I was accepted to two graduate-level English programs, I gained a little confidence. I thought that perhaps I was good enough—that my language and writing skills were good enough—to move and learn in academic circles. But during the first week of classes, my old worries surfaced again. In a writing workshop, a professor posed a question: Who are your biggest writing influences? I named Anne Rivers Siddons and Mildred D. Taylor, two authors that the professor had never heard of. I explained that Taylor has written several kids’ books I admire and that Siddons writes women’s commercial fiction. The professor gave me a blank look and explained that if I planned to write “up here” (raises his hand above his head), then I should read “up here” (keeps his hand up as though he’s trying to touch God).</p>
<p>I wondered which books I’d most likely find on this professor’s shelf. Probably Hemingway and Proust, I thought, and so I wasn’t surprised when Mr. Write-Up-Here asked if any of us had read any Proust. I was annoyed. If I can mentally go through a list of what a college professor might consider “writing up here,” then there is something wrong with our education system—that many academics think learning to write should involve stumbling around reading the same books. While I never expected to be assigned commercial writers like Siddons in my MFA classes, I didn’t expect my professors to treat me with condescension either. My problem with the professor’s ‘write up here’ comment (aside from the fact that it was laced with condescension) is that he didn’t stop to ask what I admire about Siddons and Taylor before writing them off as kids’ stuff. If he had asked, I would have assuredly told him that Taylor, while classified as a children’s author, is someone who writes about race in a bold way. She’s completely uninhibited, which is what I want to be. And while I don’t always admire the content of Siddons’ novels, I do admire her style. She writes Southern fiction (which I aspire to write), is great with characterization and setting, and I always learn new words from her, not to mention that her prose is often like poetry.</p>
<p>My write-up-here professor loves his Western writers, and while I certainly enjoy reading many white writers, I still have a problem with teachers who can only give me white writers as examples of what I should aspire to. As a minority writer, I feel that teachers like him feed a concern I’ve had for a while now—that no matter how much I improve as a writer I’ll never be considered “up here” simply because I’m not white.</p>
<p>I think one of the things that bugs me most about being told to write up here/get sophisticated is that I know I am not sophisticated and I never will be. I have known this for a very long time. I am a country woman who walks barefoot, loves anything fried, and enjoys reading and writing accessible prose and poetry.<br />
*<br />
Recently, I read a writer’s forum post where a student writer criticized the black novelist Jamaica Kincaid. He said that Kincaid is from “some country that’s probably a good place to test an A-bomb.” And when I read his comment, it confirmed an idea I had had about American schools for some time—that by focusing on white culture and white writers, we are placing value judgments on countries like Antigua (Kincaid’s homeland). By focusing on Eurocentric literature, we teach students that literature from places like U.S.A., England and France is the only literature worth reading. The result of all of this—reading mostly white authors and being graded by a white standard of speech—is that I believe for a long time I was taught in schools that white people are superior to me. One of my graduate school classmates says this isn’t true, that American students aren’t universally taught that whites are superior. My best response to this is that I am not white or middle-class or from the Midwest, but I had better speak as if I am in order to be taken seriously in a classroom. American schools have taught me that my language is inferior, and language is everything to an aspiring writer.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Way In, 2012</p>
<p>I’m not ready to watch my father’s first movie alone. In it, a boy regularly burned by his sadistic mother grows up and finds her dead in the house they still share, freeing him to indulge his homicidal pyromania with fresh female victims. Instead of looking closer at my father’s story, instead of settling into a dark room with this small piece of him, instead of committing myself to his visions scene by scene, I watch Quentin Tarantino introduce the film at the 2006 Best of the QT Film Festival on YouTube. He stands on a small stage lit by a projector in Austin, Texas, welcoming the audience, and me.</p>
<p>Unlike Tarantino, my father never wanted me to watch <i>Keep Out*</i>. He never sent me a VHS though I asked more than twice. Claiming embarrassment, his shame show whiffed of something more. “Just please don’t watch it until I’m dead,” he said.</p>
<p>My father never swung a plastic cup or slurred his words, which Tarantino does in the YouTube video. My father drank his last beer and directed his last film before I was born. Though I have no proof, I imagine the booze fed the art, and when both were gone, I proudly accepted the position of his next great love (after the booze) and creation (after the movie). I took my place on the stage in our home as a wavy-haired, wide-eyed emblem of all that he believed good in the world: I was steadfast, loyal, true. I tried to believe, as he tried new experiments with different careers and as our family took its dips and turns, that I could be these things for him always.</p>
<p>Tarantino announces the line-up at the all-night horror movie marathon, a streaming roll of cheap gore, his ‘80’s cult favorites selected from the years since the festival’s beginning in 1997. <i>Keep Out*</i> was projected on 16mm at the first QT Fest: Tarantino once cooed to my father that he owned a copy when they met in the lobby of the Arclight Cinema on Sunset Boulevard in 2009. According to a half-smug, half-flattered recounting from my father, patrons gathered around the two directors to watch them profess their mutual fandom before the next showing of <i>Inglorious Basterds</i>, which my father was going to see for the first time while Tarantino came to observe the audience. They stood in front of the waxed ticket booth and the adjacent minishop that sells film stars’ photographic autobiographies and the newest trend in key chains for Angelino drivers. The marquee opens like a menu above the booth, selections lit up like ticker tape, an oversized analog clock without numbers centered at the top warning latecomers that they will be turned away, reserved seats and sixteen-dollar tickets or no. Beyond the gourmet concession stands selling Columbian coffee and organic chocolate along with the usual fare, the cinemas are enormous caves, the round walls planted with tiny bulbs blinking like distant stars. The screens are wide just like the plump blue velvet seats, and ushers introduce the films before they play. Directors are bound to run into each other in such a place, but I always preferred the defunct Fairfax Avenue theatre’s creaky fold-down chairs, sticky floors, and one-dollar specials on weekday afternoons. The last movie I saw before they bolted the doors forever was Sarah Silverman’s <i>Jesus is Magic</i>.</p>
<p>I am a fan of Tarantino. Tarantino is <i>a fan</i> of my father, and this means something to me, but it doesn’t help me know what I am to my father: beloved, a prize, a member of his clan, a devotee, a piece of him.</p>
<p>“Love you,” I say into a receiver.</p>
<p>“Take care,” he replies.</p>
<p>I’m sure—<i>sure</i>—there is some secret at the core of his movie that will show me who my father is, how I can learn to be a recognized artist—possess a fan base (however small), garner success at the bank (second at the box office opening weekend to <i>Friday the 13<sup>th</sup></i>), publicly admired by at least one genius in his field. If I look close enough at his movie, I will understand him (I won’t): his ultimate limitations as a filmmaker, as a man, as a father. If I can understand his film, I’ll learn what drove him to drink, to make this movie, to make me. I’ll identify what darkness is only his and not at all mine to inherit (a day will never pass when I won’t have to decide this piece by piece, or decide not to decide). I can set myself free.</p>
<p>To get free from so many questions, to search for answers, I go to the place that has always given the desert Los Angeles wasteland where I grew up color and meaning. The place that told me about all the characters there are to be: the television afterschool, the movies, the computer for research or to write. Like all of us, I go to screens.</p>
<p>Tarantino barks from the video to “shut the fuck up” while the movies are playing.</p>
<p>“This is not an it’s-so-bad-it’s-good festival.… we’re gonna give [the films] <i>res</i>PECT,” he says, leaning forward and practically spitting into the audience.</p>
<p>The demand for respect delivered in an entirely disrespectful manner is all too familiar: hypocrisy is second nature to a man with a drink in his hand. Not that I should know because I never saw my father that way. But sometimes even if the drink is gone, the drunk isn’t. So I know anyway.</p>
<p>My father decides to burn women—their nails painted and hair done, writhing with feminine virility and completely naked—with a torch blower in the basement of a decrepit New Jersey mansion. Or, his film’s protagonist, Donnie does.</p>
<p>I open a scanned photograph he has sent me of himself as a twenty-something in black-and-white. “AN ANGRY YOUNG MAN,” my father titles it in all caps, and I compare a still shot of Donnie, played by a young Italian-American actor whom I know from <i>The Sopranos</i>—a show we watched together in the living room with bowls of vanilla Haagen Daas and Hershey’s syrup. Side by side, the images double on my laptop screen: curly brown hair, narrow eyes, a square face, a big nose, and thin lips shut tight. I assure myself that my father is more handsome than Donnie.</p>
<p>My father and I share a broad face and wide nose.</p>
<p>I have been a mirror.</p>
<p>My reflection in the dressing room at a Versace outlet store: I carefully slide myself into a black silk satin pantsuit my father has picked out for me to try on. I am seventeen, just old enough to carry the outfit if I stand still, statuesque, and wear stilettos. When I step out to the main room with its shiny white linoleum floors, my father is across from me speechless at the sheen of the suit, and I remember another photograph of him and my mother in the back of a black limousine on their way to the premiere of his movie. In this suit, I could be in the backseat with them, all glitter and glam. “You have to have it,” he says, and though I’m not sure because I have no reason to own anything made of Italian silk satin at seventeen, I say okay. I am a dream in this suit; I am my father’s dream in this suit; my father loves me in this suit.</p>
<p>“Why are you digging into this crap,” he says into the phone from Los Angeles when I ask about his past. “What makes us who we are?” he says.</p>
<p>“No less is this the best of QT…” Tarantino says into the mic smirking and with proper Hollywood pomp, “…these are the <i>stars</i> of the marathon class.”</p>
<p>Enthusiastic but thin applause claps against the theatre walls. I keep watching, the answer to my father’s questions rising like my face from his.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Home Screening, 2011</p>
<p>The first time I watch <i>Keep Out*</i>, a couple of friends join me at my boyfriend’s place, one of them a trashy-slasher aficionado. We rent it on DVD from the independently-owned rental treasure trove on Main Street in the small Northwest college town where I’m living—I can’t believe they have a copy.</p>
<p>“They had it?” my aficionado-friend says on his way in, eight inches taller than me, eyebrows raised, and carrying a case of beer and a bottle of whiskey. My father’s movie was shelved next to the good stuff the big screens in town won’t play. Pride stirs a rock in my diaphragm, then small panic: it’s as if I’ve stolen something, but I paid $2.50 to have the DVD for a week. The smell of beer is on my friend’s breath, his mouth agape in front of me, and I wonder if $2.50 is enough to buy my way into my father’s imagination. Does this buy my father’s permission?</p>
<p>We settle into the couch, beer and whiskey at our feet, and play the movie on a flat screen. These other eyes combined with my boyfriend’s frequent trips to the bathroom are distracting: I can’t hear or see my father. I realize I’ve invited them because I couldn’t face this alone. I needed these men in the room to drown him out, still fearful (though entirely unaware of it) that his demons will claim me once and for all. The full implications are lost—why angle the camera that way, why from that corner, why costume the first victim in brown (my father has always hated brown clothing). With each frame, I yearn more and more for privacy. I want to consider every choice made on set and in the cutting room just a few years before my mother and father chose to have me, but instead of time to do it, there’s company.</p>
<p>I sip slowly on a single can of PBR and fear holds me still in my seat: could this slasher-savvy friend of mine see more into my father’s psyche than I can? Can he, fueled by beer and whiskey, see what Tarantino sees? I wonder if drinking is the secret.</p>
<p>Months later, I work up the courage to get drunk and cue up the movie my father said he made “so that [he] could make the movies [he] really wanted to make.” But he never made those movies. He made this one.</p>
<p>The images that by sober daylight are cheaply produced and somewhat disturbing, become haunting while I am drunk and alone in my apartment at night. I lean sloppily at my desk after only three beers and become easily spooked at the cheap scares. How much of Donnie is my father’s recreation of himself?</p>
<p>He is dreaming: at the beach it is dusk and his hair, thick and dark like my father’s, blows in sea air. Explosions light up the dark surrounding Donnie as he watches fire blaze paths through the sand. One path cools to reveal a deep hole left behind: a hole my parents dug together at the Jersey shore. A synthetic xylophone plops and hums and reverbs like a blown speaker. Donnie stands at the edge and looks down, a close up of his eyes backlit by the horizon twilight, his brow creased in tension just like my father’s. A shot of the hole: the bottom is too dark to see. Atonal sounds settle with a wide shot of Donnie from below. A pull in tighter on his face. He realizes there is something in the hole. A synthetic alarm sounds. Three burnt bodies jump and grab Donnie by the ankles. The burned women pull him down. He claws at the sand.</p>
<p>I stop the movie.</p>
<p>Instead, I look at stills—Donnie’s blank face on the beach just like my father’s in Santa Monica, the naked redhead with pale skin like mine chained up and screaming, the fire of the torch in the steel basement. What have I been a victim of? Or am I a martyr? What do I believe?</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The Mall, 1991</p>
<p>On Thursdays after school, my father picks me up and we go to a movie. The day is better because I won’t walk home like all the other kids, rolling a house key between my fingers, or land on our white couch to stay for many hours in front of the television. While that time alone with the small screen is sacred, the thrill of walking out the chainlink fence from the schoolyard and into my father’s fourth-hand forest green BMW, tan leather seats hot on my thighs and the air conditioning on high, makes me forget the daily monotony. He has released me from homework, dirty dishes, drudgery—and we roll west to my favorite mall.</p>
<p>The Westside Pavillion has pink and turquoise trim with skylights and steep escalators; it is where Tom Petty shot the music video for his song “Free Fallin.’” I’m embarrassed when I hear it—“she’s a good girl… loves horses… crazy ‘bout Elvis….” I’m a character, summarizable by a pop song. Home from a riding lesson in the valley one day, I find pictures of my father as a boy in a kitchen drawer. “He looks like Elvis!” I burst out to no one in particular.</p>
<p>We buy candy and sit next to each other in the cool dark. The erratic action and white noise of normal life fades and we enter a world of contrasted color and shadow, precisely timed soundtracks, and iconic faces acting life out as it is when we make a story of it. I sink myself in stories; my father has always read to me before bed. This to me is what I imagine booze was to him, a safe and warm escape where I can dream myself as big as the faces on-screen. He gives this to me. I can be anything in a dark theatre.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p><i>The Nasties</i>, 2010</p>
<p>Glen Criddle has an exploitation film review called <i>The Nasties</i> on YouTube, and he covered <i>Keep Out*</i>.</p>
<p>“Donnie picks his victims to have a mirror for both his hatred of women and himself… [yet] the killer’s motives are basic and unexplored.”</p>
<p>As a kid, I saw stills of the first murder scene in the movie hung on the wall of my father’s office. That scene is what I wait to see and it is what I fear witnessing the most: it is my father’s magnum opus as a filmmaker.</p>
<p>My father’s first victim in the film was a Playboy model and friend of my mother’s. It was a closed set. Completely naked, her wrists chained above her, she is doused with gasoline from a red five-gallon canister by Donnie’s hand. In a blue room of steel-plated walls, the gas pours into her mouth as she screams. Flame shoots at her with a pull of Donnie’s finger. The color and field of view is the most beautiful: I can’t look away.</p>
<p>Criddle is right. Donnie’s motives are unclear, but my father’s are not: this scene is worth watching again and again.</p>
<p>Criddle says, “There is some complexity to this broken man…despite the disjointed way it’s presented to us.”</p>
<p>I learn that there are several cuts to the film, one for each release in the United States, in the UK, in Europe. I learn that many exploitation films from the 1970s and ‘80s had multiple cuts and I wonder about the stories those directors meant to tell versus the ones movie studios would allow. I learn that many writers and directors of exploitation films are sickened by their work, despite positive reviews or box office success.</p>
<p>My father, to me: “I did what I could with what I had.”</p>
<p>Enter envy here: my father defends himself, even I defend him, but I agree with the critic before a single word of my own colors a page. My critic leaps from a pit in the brain. I walk up, like Donnie on the beach, looking for a reason to bury my story, myself in the sand.</p>
<p>Sometimes it takes me, but I get a grip on something solid and pull myself back to the white screen and blinking cursor.</p>
<p>What is it jumping out at my father? Is it so different from what is clutching at my ankles? Is my father only better at pretending it isn’t there, at walking with the weight? OR: Is it all mere costumes and lighting—do we create our own nightmares?</p>
<p>Criddle: “It should have at least something going on below the surface to convey some reason for [its] bleakness.”</p>
<p>The bleakness I know: the white of our couch afterschool, of city noise in the wee hours, of a blank page. Wide streets of Vine and Highland and Sunset running alongside movie studios and homeless shelters and mini malls. The Santa Monica Pier stretched across the pale beach into the Pacific, Ferris wheel spinning and sparkling to me. The hills rolling in and out of the valley, grown over in desert greenery crackling under the sun. I’ve never seen those leaves go dark except by wild fire, sometimes a match burned black deep within the branches and ash, smoke billowing over the city.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Family Fire, 1995</p>
<p>In our bedroom, my little sister, seven years old, screams and cries in her bed and my father stands over her yelling. I tell him, “Stop it, stop,” but he won’t hear me from just four feet away, so I say it again, loud, STOP IT, and before the two syllables are out, he spins around, his hand held above me, muscles flexed and taut. I scoot back quick and fold my eleven-year-old body into the corner of my twin bed where the walls meet. I wait, every joint locked, the room quiet but for the sound of blood pulsing through my temples. His anger is suspended above me, all its weight wanting to fall, and I fear more than anything that he’ll hit me anyway, after this time to think about it; after we’ve been face-to-face, me cowering in the corner, eyes begging him still to stop; after the adrenaline has settled some, leaving the nerves vulnerable. It will hurt more if he hits me now; more will be broken this way.</p>
<p>Instead: he laughs.  Lowering his hand, he smiles at me, as if it were all a joke. From below, his white teeth gleam with saliva and his broken eye contact is a confession of what he knows: his power over me is absolute. On his side, I am safe; on my own, I am vulnerable to everything, especially him. I feel sure he is laughing at my smallness, at my being eleven and unable to stop him. I feel as though he laughs because to hit me would be too easy, and so, unfulfilling. I feel as though he sees all the weakness I cannot change, and is amused.</p>
<p>My bones rattle, teeth clattering in my skull.</p>
<p>“You <i>ass</i>hole,” I say, just like I’ve heard my mother say so many times. His face drops and all is perfectly quiet. “You <i>fuck</i>ing asshole.” I say it again and again and it is as though the oldest thing I know is speaking for me.</p>
<p>His face darkens and he becomes so still; I’ve never spoken to him like this and now it’s me that won’t stop. My relentlessness awakens him, his muscles making the smallest movement so that I’m sure he’s beginning to grow in front of me. I run out of the room, down the stairs, out the back door. When I return from the sandbox and swings hours later, it’s dinnertime and we take our places around the rectangular glass table. I sit at my end, across from him.</p>
<p>“You have to apologize,” my mother says.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” I say.</p>
<p>“Like you mean it, Katie,” she says.</p>
<p>My father is stone-faced and doesn’t look at me. I wait for him to raise his eyes, to make his own admission, apology. I do what my mother says.</p>
<p>“And you’ll never disrespect him again,” she demands. I feel the heat from the spotlight lamp hanging over the table, its reflection on the glass an electric stovetop for my boiling gut.</p>
<p>In a flashback, Donnie’s mother holds his arms over a gas flame to punish him.</p>
<p>For a year or two afterward, I say as little to my father as possible. One morning, we go for a drive downtown away from the ocean and he says, “I couldn’t believe how scared you looked when I raised my hand. I laughed because I couldn’t believe what I was doing. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Between the times my father and I step out the front door and back inside again, we begin to talk about nothing in particular.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Riding Waves, 2002</p>
<p>“I don’t love you anymore,” my scrawny high school boyfriend says at twilight a few months before I leave Los Angeles for college. I roll home under a purple sky in the silver pick up truck my father bought me fighting back tears that won’t stop coming. My father sees me come in the back door and already knows. The next day, he and I go for a drive, and he puts on an Emmy Lou Harris record in his black truck so I can just let the tears fall. He owned a black pick up truck twenty years ago; Donnie drove young women to the New Jersey mansion in it.</p>
<p>That night, I see a late show of <i>Whale Rider</i>, the first movie I watch in a theatre alone. I will go to the movies alone whenever I need to be someone else. In a familiar dark room, the story of a young girl stepping into a man’s role as leader of her tribe is backdrop for the ocean at daybreak and the underwater shots of the girl gripping the back of a baleen whale. I ride home from the movie in the silver pick up, street lights glinting off my windshield, and decide to drive to the beach early the next morning. When I sleep, I sink into water, dreaming of an ocean cliff, and rise before dawn to meet surfers bobbing like seals in the breakers. It is cold, the cab of the truck like a womb. The hood reflects the smoky blue of the sky and sea, fog clouding any light from the sun. On the slate horizon, I see the orange balloon my father tied to the driver’s side mirror before he led me, hand over my eyes, to my truck and I got in for the first time. “My baby ocean” he always says when we drive along the coast, and looks with a slight longing at the surfers below. I will be gone soon into my own story, but the waves hush memory and imagination, rolling one over another, over another. The hair on my arms bristles under a gray sweatshirt; the cold gets in. I stay, a chill creeping into my bones, and imagine my laughter mixing with the surfers’ playful calls, the icy water crashing with our voices.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>They are living in the Dead Cities of Syria. In Serjilla, amid the abandoned ruins of ancient Roman villas, refugees now shelter from war. I saw this in a news video, recognized the place where, a few years ago, I took a happy tourist stroll.</p>
<p>The reporter crouches beside a wall of stone as shells explode above him. Below, in rooms where animals once lived, families huddle. The camera pans the faces of children. Their eyes stare with naked blankness. A woman squats beside a fire: &#8220;What am I, a terrorist? What&#8217;s my little child, a terrorist?&#8221; she asks through the translator. The camera finds another woman as she thumbs away tears.</p>
<p>Serjilla is a few miles off the road from Hama to Aleppo. It is among hundreds of Byzantine ruins clustered in northern Syria, named &#8220;dead cities&#8221; by some early European explorers. But these sites were less cities than large villages that thrived for five centuries on agriculture: olives, olive oil, wine, wheat, grapes. Then climate changed. Drought and rising temperatures rendered land unproductive. Bubonic plague struck. There were Persian invasions. In 550 AD, after centuries of prosperity, the villages began to decline.</p>
<p>The day I stopped, in November 2010, I was with my husband, David, and the driver we had hired, a man from Aleppo named Abed. We sought Serjilla from the guidebook&#8217;s description as &#8220;&#8230; the most eerie and evocative of the Dead Cities.&#8221; And indeed the site was a vast scatter of crumbling structures with empty windows and doorways like dark eyes in the sides of stone buildings. The triangular ends of pitched roofs—with no roof—pricked skyward. Facades were softened by the rounded shapes of arches and columns. All was cut from the limestone massif of northern Syria, white blocks now corroded, stained a rusty orange from the slow burn of oxidation, stained black from the spread of fungus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within the neighborhood of memories that are journeys, I have a house that is Syria. I began the building before I left home: I read guidebooks, made reservations, got visas. Then I crossed the Lebanese border at Aboudieh with <i>Syrian Arab Republic</i> stamped in my passport. I gathered furnishings from the corpus of sensations that swelled with the traveling: the tastes of fresh pomegranate juice and sweet black tea; the sights of Crusader castles, of sidewalk markets with abundant mounds of tomatoes and green onions, tangerines and oranges, bunches of parsley and mint; the hospitality of a Bedouin woman who served us tea in her tent in the desert outside Palmyra.</p>
<p>My photos and journals, the blue silk scarf with the pistachio pattern that I bought at the old souk in Aleppo, these are among the souvenirs that keep Syria vivid for me. <i>Souvenir.</i> In French it means to remember, is rooted in latin for <i>subvenire</i>, to come up, come to mind.</p>
<p>I think back to the Bedouin woman who invited us into her family tent near the spot in the road where we stopped to let a herd of camels cross. I remember how the woman welcomed us with a wide and luminous smile, how she wore black robes and a red-and-white-checked headscarf, how we sat on carpets as we waited for the sugar and tea to steep in the stainless steel kettle, how we held the hot edges of small glasses to sip the tea, how the nearly blind grandmother who sat in a plastic chair near the tent door held up her hands for me to see her marriage tattoos, how Abed and the woman laughed as if we were silly when we offered to pay, how the woman and I leaned toward each other as David took a photograph.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I square today&#8217;s news with the sweet souvenirs of my journey? How can anyone I met, any kind stranger, be unchanged by the destruction that has descended on Syria? Because I was there, because I ask these questions, I listen. I watch. I read. I recognize: the old souk in Aleppo, now mostly destroyed; the grand Roman ruins of Palmyra, now shelled, the museum looted. And then there are the bodies: shot in the head, hands bound, pulled from the Orontes River near Hama. The dead and wounded scattered outside bakeries where the hungry had queued. The gassed children wrapped in shrouds.</p>
<p>Some of the living are sheltering in Serjilla. And my abode of memory is draped with the dark dust of sorrow.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The mystery of the catfish<br />
Is its sweetness,<br />
The gorgeous meat of it</p>
<p>Fed on the silt<br />
And bitterness a loner clings to<br />
At the bottom.</p>
<p>In its own element<br />
It’s close to weightless,<br />
A dark self</p>
<p>Respecting the sacrament of night.<br />
Who else acknowledges<br />
Solitude so obligingly,</p>
<p>Its filth a contradictory savor.<br />
See how it sways<br />
In the water’s music,</p>
<p>Washes its length in song,<br />
In slow adagios,<br />
All that pale flesh</p>
<p>Pressed against a lute of bones.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Walt Whitman rest stop, midday. Ten-minute break, shouts the bus driver. Four cashiers working the rush at Roy Rogers, lines twelve deep. A blend of voices, bickering, foreign. Pee instead and buy a Twix candy bar from the vending machine, have eight and one quarter minutes to poke around for memorabilia. Nothing doing. Rack sells t-shirts proclaiming ardor for the state of New Jersey, shot glasses and magnets, paperback romances with shiny embossed covers. Run my finger over the titles and joke don’t read Braille, har har. Clerk gives a dead look. Half my age, hasn’t heard of <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, would I like to buy a fashion magazine instead? Seminude on the cover. Singing the body electric—must be the connection. You’ve made it in America when they name a rest stop after you. Clerk pushes nickel change across counter as if to say don’t want any trouble. Only places it says Whitman are the sign above the door and the boxes of chocolates.</p>
<p>Outside, three identical buses idling. Wouldn’t it be something to board the wrong one? Get lost in America, the easiest thing to do if you’ve got the guts. Nobody’s looked up since Port Authority. Who’s sitting two seats ahead of me? Two seats back? Anonymous One and Two. But better to stay on course. Job waiting in D.C., been coasting too long. Good old Benjamin for passing along resume, renting me his spare sofa. Should’ve bought him a magnet and a bottle for the fridge. Recognize red-haired lady, blue dress, from window seat. Follow her to the far bus. Starting over, easiest thing to do in America. All opportunities equal. Chances to fail.</p>
<p>Settle in with magazine rolled in lap, glossy cleavage facing out. Will read later. Close eyes for a snooze while driver up and down the aisle counts heads. Smell of fried chicken. Dream of success like a wheel so immense it never completes a revolution. Getting carried away: just a basement mailroom gig. But full benefits. Dental care. Free stamps.</p>
<p>“Anybody sitting there?”</p>
<p>Driver looms overhead. Empty seat across the aisle, one row back. Mexican boy, ten or so, fidgets in dazzle of window sun. Adjacent to vacant seat in question.</p>
<p>“No.” Shakes head.</p>
<p>Eye contact with driver, wants verification. What do I know? Shrug. Driver, satisfied, returns to wheel. Never counted heads at bus terminal. Slapdash manic boarding process, running late, collected tickets and gunned it out of Port Authority. Kid doesn’t look old enough to travel solo, but that’s someone else’s concern. I’m nobody’s father. Bus swings onto Jersey Turnpike and makes for Delaware, back on schedule. Walt Whitman and Roy Rogers recede into the past, leaving only the lingering grease-smells and the quiet pleasure of emptied bladders.</p>
<p>Unwrap candy bar and flip through magazine. Unexpected nipple in first advertisement—when do you ever expect a nipple? Shield quickly and glance at red-haired lady in blue dress. Safe. She’s watching the road, maybe asleep. Caramel on my fingers. Lick them clean and skim different ads. A smooth ass in a foldout. Temptations beyond the crease. Start to get a little hard and check red-haired lady: face still to the glass. Adjust myself through pocket and unfold advertisement. Wonder if the women in D.C. will look like—Christ. A male model. Been tricked like this before. Still, an encouraging sign nearing forty. No trouble at all in that department. All a man needs is suggestion. Better stick to the articles.</p>
<p>Here’s one: “Hottest summer colors.” At least the models are clothed. Goddamn androgynous men. Wouldn’t have been fooled if their sissy legs had hair. Must remember to buy razor when I get to D.C. Lots of blue on the page. Periwinkle’s back in fashion—huh. So much to keep track of. How do women leave the house in the morning?</p>
<p>Benjamin said to meet near office on K Street. Candy bar consumed, won’t eat for a few hours. Ought to treat him to dinner, but how? First paycheck not till end of month. Perhaps buy a half-dozen eggs, fry up omelets. Two-dollar dinner. Bachelor Special. Will be nice to share meals again. Should go to the museums when I arrive, hear they’re free.</p>
<p>Sky darkening, sound of travelers dozing, secret-whispering; a disembodied hiccup; tire crossing rumble strip. Child in baseball cap darts up the aisle, slapping a magazine across seatbacks like he’s high-fiving the losing team. <i>Good game. Good game.</i> No stops left. Only Benjamin knows I’m coming. What will that feel like: to be thought after, to figure into plans? Also: to buy new clothes, possess books, read until the small hours and not be kicked out of libraries. Bring a woman home. A clean start. All mistakes forgotten.</p>
<p>Oh let’s get there already. Already already.</p>
<p>Big photo spread of periwinkle. Didn’t know it had gone anywhere. Saw it today even. Maybe red-haired lady’s dress is periwinkle, very with the times. Hold page surreptitiously to dress. No match. Where did I see it? A periwinkle shirt. Yes, an hour ago, by the vending machine at Walt Whitman. Boy of fifteen or sixteen, alone. No. Arguing with somebody. His brother. Talking Spanish, could only understand tone, no words except <i>no</i>. <i>No</i> the same in English. Heated, talking fast, <i>vaya</i>, <i>vaya</i>, older boy in a periwinkle polo. Definitely the color. And the younger boy, the brother, looked familiar. No. It can’t be. Turn around. Easiest thing in the world. The boy at the window, riding alone. See if it’s him. Christ. Christ almighty. It’s not my mistake.</p>
