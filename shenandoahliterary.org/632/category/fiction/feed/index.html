								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The two women stood from the augured hole as ice crystallized on the fishing line. Beth rolled her lips over her teeth and bit down. Her incisors ached with the cold and blowing snow. Finally, Henry asked, “Did you touch him?”</p>
<p>Beth fisted her fingers in both pockets and turned to Henry: her eyes dark stones.</p>
<p>A wave of heat broke against Beth’s sternum and across her hairline. She swallowed the saliva at the back of her throat, and watched Henry chew the inside of her cheek while she waited for Beth’s answer, the fringe of Henry’s gray hair whipping in the wind. Beth said, “To hug him hello and good-bye, just like I did with you but less often.”</p>
<p>“You never kissed him?”</p>
<p>“I never anything-ed with him. He never knew.”</p>
<p>“You never told him.”</p>
<p>“How could I?”</p>
<p>“You just told me.” Henry turned and stomped to the second tip up hole, away from Beth.</p>
<p>Beth looked back at the Humdinger, the portable ice house they bought last year from Cabela’s Bargain Cave just weeks after Leonard died, three years after Rags’ death. The Humdinger nestled fifty yards from the next closest ice house, Hard Up, a permanent house made of plywood and 2x4s painted camouflaged green and brown. The other mismatched houses on Steward’s Lump—Going Fishing, Marty, Trash House, Master Baiter—seemed uncharacteristically peaceful. The snow muffled sounds of shouted curses and crushed beer cans; the haze of the blizzard softened primary colors and blaze orange. The Trash House’s pile of empty beer cases, propane tanks, busted chairs and buckets was covered in white.</p>
<p>The Humdinger appeared tight and safe. Before today, Beth had imagined Henry’s reaction in the canvas walls—maybe nodding, maybe even thanking Beth for loving Henry’s husband Leonard when she couldn’t. Not this.</p>
<p>Beth blinked back the sting at the corners of her eyes, looked up at the sky—flat gray, no shade change, no cloud shape, just thick lead. Snowflakes landed on her lashes, something that used to make her feel beautiful.</p>
<p>Turning, she saw Henry stooped over their other tip up. Beth marched towards the hole, her face burning in its flush. The ice gagged under her feet.</p>
<p>Henry clenched and splayed her mittenless hand and said, “Dug into the damn minnow bucket with my bare hand instead of the scoop.” She pulled her lips into a circle and sucked in a breath, “Fucking stupid.” Henry jammed her hand back into her mitten. “It’s burning. Think I’m gonna puke.”</p>
<p>Taking her friend’s mittened hand, Beth rubbed it hard. Henry’s face was white, green at the edges, her lips the color of a crappie belly. She felt Henry’s knuckles and thought of her fingernails like creek pebbles. Beth said, “I never loved him more than I loved you.”</p>
<p>Henry huffed, yanked her hand away, and stomped to the Humdinger. Beth rebaited the hook, lowered the line, and reset the tip up. Icy crystals ticked against the orange plastic flag. A shout came from one of the ice shacks. Across the lake snowmobiles whined, then nothing. The hole in the ice glazed. They weren’t going to catch a thing.</p>
<p>Beth looked over her shoulder, but the Humdinger revealed nothing. She glanced to the plowed ice road they’d driven in on and her Jeep. She’d named the Wrangler Sir Wildgin when she bought it for her sixtieth birthday, the fourth she had celebrated without Henry during the Moratorium. Beth had been sick of her practical Crown Vic. People assumed she was a cop, which was fun the first couple of years since she flashed her high beams at friends and got them to pull over, but she was always stuck behind slow pokes who thought she would give them a ticket. She wanted to be young and spunky, fun and unpredictable again. Every year as soon as it hit fifty degrees, she took the top off the Jeep and drove all over town, into Alexandria, down around the rich lake homes, blasting the Bee Gees or Bob Marley with the wind in her hair, trying to reclaim something lost.</p>
<p>She checked the tip up and glanced back to the shore. A herd of kids they’d passed on the drive out, maybe a dozen of them, were making a rink—an awful day for it. The foolishness of youth. She had to squint her memory to see her own similar days. The ice boat she and Henry had made in high school, the only girls in the tri-county competition.</p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">As Beth got to know the feeling of wanting Leonard fourteen years ago, she took to wearing her shoulder-length hair up. Tarnished brown and streaked with silver, Beth fought her hair into a ponytail or a falling apart French twist in the obscene notion that Leonard might see her neck and want to touch it. As if the plush of the twenty pounds she should lose made her neck supple, not fat. As if the three moles that had appeared in the shape of a boomerang under her left ear would tempt him.</p>
<p>Beth couldn’t have said exactly when she fell in love with Leonard. In the beginning, it wasn’t that kind of a love. It was more like what she felt for Henry. Until then, one day, it wasn’t because she found herself sitting at their kitchen table over venison sloppy joes and lima beans, wondering what Leonard looked like if his flannel shirt was unbuttoned, and what his beat up old hands might feel like at her low back.</p>
<p>There’d been a handful of moments before the Moratorium, sometimes with as many as two years in between them, when Leonard seemed to actually see Beth. Once, forty-five years into knowing him, she’d arrived at the farm, and the power had gone out. The air was cool and scrubbed, still ringing with ozone, lilac leaves dripping, and the good earth scent drifting up from the fields. Leonard sat on the steps in a clean t-shirt, hair still damp from a shower, his thin frame poised with the grace and strength of a buck. Henry nowhere to be seen. Low and sweet he’d said, “Come watch the fireflies with me, Bethesda.”</p>
<p>“Only if you don’t call me that, Leonard.”</p>
<p>“Why? You don’t like it?”</p>
<p>“It sounds like a witch’s name.”</p>
<p>“Exactly right. You’re bewitching.”</p>
<p>When she’d gone to sit by his side, he reached for her hand and her breath caught. He buttoned the cuff of her shirtsleeve, and she waited for his eyes to make contact with hers, felt his sandpaper fingers on her skin, a touch that electrified her. She could smell Ivory soap mixing with his heat. She thanked him and still waited for his eyes, but he was transfixed by the lightning bugs, and that, too, was charming.</p>
<p>The Brasselman brothers: Leonard and Rags. Leonard three years older and Henry’s husband for forty-two years until his heart attack last year. Rags the one Henry loved for the last thirty-five of those years, though he was married to, and raising children with, Diane until he died four years ago. In most of that time, Beth dated serially. And then she fell for Leonard. And after that, she started the Moratorium, hoping to someday return to the farmhouse, knowing that could only happen if Leonard or Henry was dead.</p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">Back in the Humdinger, Beth gave Henry a new beer, and opened one for herself.</p>
<p>Henry nodded toward the Humdinger’s plasticized window and said, “We should buy a motorized augur. That guy’s cut three holes in the time it took us to cut one.” She added, “Makes us look like amateurs.”</p>
<p>“I know. And you want a permanent ice house when we always said the great part about the Humdinger is that we can take her anywhere.”</p>
<p>“But we don’t go anywhere. We just go here.”</p>
<p>Beth said nothing. She stretched her pinching back and checked her line. Without looking at Henry, she asked, “Did you know?”</p>
<p>Henry shook her head and said, “No.” She rubbed at her knee with a mittened hand. “I guess I thought you two were just like siblings.” She jigged her rod, sipped her beer. She turned the heater up a notch, wouldn’t look at Beth. “Just because I don’t obsess about sex like you, doesn’t mean we didn’t have sex. I didn’t deprive him,” said Henry.</p>
<p>“I didn’t say you did.” Beth sighed and jigged her rod. She pinched the inside of her lip between her molars. “I told you I loved him. Which I did. And he didn’t love me.” Her skin flushed in another hot wave. Sweat gathered at her neck, a drip rivuleting to her cleavage. Her palms perspired inside her mittens, though her fingertips were numb. “I’m glad you had so much hot fucking together. That’s really great.”</p>
<p>“Bethesda.”</p>
<p>“Henrietta.”</p>
<p>They were silent a long time. Beth stood and peered out the Humdinger’s window to see if the tip ups’ flags had gone off. Neither had. Henry hated the window, couldn’t understand how in this day and age there wasn’t plastic that could be seen through clearly. Beth always argued in favor of the haze. She liked the world muffled and blurred.</p>
<p>In the distance, snowmobilers opened their throttles on the uninterrupted plane of the lake. When the sound was gone, Beth said, “I’m sorry, Henry. Maybe I shouldn’t have told you.”</p>
<p>“I mean I knew there had to be something. Your best friend doesn’t just vanish.” Henry jigged and sipped her beer. She spoke to the hole in the ice. “I tried to ask Leonard about it. I thought maybe he’d done something to offend you.” Henry flipped the handle of her reel once and held the rod still. “I considered it, of course. But I couldn’t think of a single time I’d ever seen him love you or you him. I knew the way I was about Rags before he’d made his decision about staying with Diane, and even after too. I couldn’t take my eyes off him. Did a hundred little things to let him know I was thinking of him, to get him to notice me—cooked his favorite roast, wore green, played Harry Nilsson—and I’d never seen you do anything to catch Leonard’s eye. Had never once seen you and Leonard look at each other the way Rags and I did.”</p>
<p>Beth was quiet. Henry was right. He’d never once looked at her in any way but as a friend. He’d rejected her with indifference. Beth pulled her hat farther down on her head and considered telling Henry about wearing her hair up.</p>
<p>“Did you?” asked Henry.</p>
<p>“Did I what?”</p>
<p>“Did you two ever look at each other like that?”</p>
<p>“He only had eyes for you.”</p>
<p>“Ha. He only had eyes for the farm.”</p>
<p>Beth nodded, jigged. “It was a thing I liked in him. The way he didn’t care what others thought.”</p>
<p>Henry fiddled with the reel’s handle. Spun it back and forth. Had stopped jigging.</p>
<p>Beth said to the ice, “It reminded me of you.” She added, quietly, “Of the way you used to be.”</p>
<p>Henry cocked her head, turned and ran her eyes over Beth’s face. “So I’m the reason you wanted to have sex with my husband?”</p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">It was Henry who had convinced Beth’s parents to let them build the ice boat in the back of the pole barn. Maybe because of the scholarship for some of their materials, Beth’s parents let the girls work on the boat, regardless of chores and homework. They poured over plans, ordered the sail, picked out sheets of ash wood in Alexandria, and finagled cleats and blocks from Washed Up Marina.<b> </b>Henry’s mom got them old hockey skates to have grounded down for runners. Bloom’s Hardware donated bolts, lag-screws, screw-eyes, wire nails, and spikes. One of the other competitor’s dad did the mill work for them. Beth’s father even got a salvaged Ford steering rod from one of his buddies. Absorbed in the work, Beth would catch Henry chewing the inside of her cheek. When she did, Beth flicked her hand to get her to stop. But sometimes, both of them so lost in the work, Henry caused her cheeks to bleed, and she couldn’t eat spaghetti or drink orange juice until they healed.</p>
<p>The girls sawed, glued, bolted, screwed, nailed until they had the tiller, hull, mast, and runners—until they built a simple but sleek ice boat.</p>
<p>Race day: the boys—loud, shoving—didn’t look at Beth or Henry before the event started. The girls took third because they finished. Three other boats didn’t: hull sideboards cracked, guy wires snapped, masts broke. The cracking of wood far louder than the ice’s thundering popping, though even the ice noisier than usual since nearly the whole small lake had been plowed free of snow. That day, the wind stronger than forecasted, it should have been Beth to sail the boat, her extra size and weight could have helped through the tacking and jibing. Standing on the ice, toes numb, snot frozen, voice hoarse with yelling, she willed the boat across the finish line: choked up on the sail’s imaginary rope around her arm, pined for the wind’s tug and pull. They might have taken second, maybe even won.</p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">Beth left the Humdinger, checked the tip ups’ flags, peed on the lee side of the portable, and came back with two more beers from the case in the snow. She was chilled all the way through, her previous sweat damp and cold against her.</p>
<p>In the Humdinger Henry said, “Let’s get out of here.”</p>
<p>Beth nodded. They reeled in their minnows. Both were still alive, untouched, eyes bulging. Wordlessly, the women threw the minnows into the holes and turned off the heater. Beth pulled the tip-ups while Henry broke down the ice house.</p>
<p>Beth had caught them a couple of times. Maybe that was their plan—to get caught so it would be over. Then it would be too late for explanations: they’d get what they wanted. But Henry and Rags had to be found out by someone who didn’t know: Leonard, Diane, one of the kids.</p>
<p>At the annual July Fourth picnic at Henry and Leonard’s, Beth had arrived early. She wanted to help with the final preparations because Henry’d been sick that year—a head cold that had gone to her chest. Maybe it was the oscillating fan on the kitchen counter that kept them from hearing her car on the driveway’s gravel, her opening and closing of the screen door, her shuffling of bags loaded down with potato salad, chips, beer, and fireworks.</p>
<p>The vinegar smell of Henry’s homemade barbeque sauce stung her eyes as Beth walked into the kitchen and saw Rags’ hand on Henry’s hip. They stood close, foreheads nearly touching, whispering. Henry saw Beth first, and flawlessly, immediately, she said to Rags, “You’re right. There’s a thread there,” and moved her hand to where his had been, her two fingers plucking an imaginary bit of nothing from her waist. Rags blushed, coughed a hello to Beth, and said he had to go buy ice for the coolers.</p>
<p>In the oscillating fan’s air—blazing humidity then suffocating whirlwind—Beth thought her sacks of groceries would bring her to the floor as Henry smiled at her, nearly winked. Beth wore the sweat of the kitchen; her mouth watered as if she might puke. But Henry took the beer from her and thanked her for the casserole she’d brought earlier in the week and never once said why or how she could lie straight to Beth’s face even though there’d been no reason to: she’d told Beth about Rags since the beginning.</p>
<p>Before the Moratorium, Beth hoped for Diane’s death—quick and painless. She didn’t dislike Rags’ wife—Beth had attended enough Thanksgiving and Easter dinners to know Diane was a kind woman, a bit dull—wearing a different cat sweatshirt for every event—but kind. Beth couldn’t keep herself from the indulgence of made up newspaper headlines: <i>Diane Brasselman, 46, Killed by 18-wheeler </i>or <i>Brasselman, 49, Mother of Three, Dead After Aneurism</i>. Beth was sure Henry would convince Rags they should be together and then Beth could have Leonard. She would help on the farm without bitching, would probably lose the weight she couldn’t shrug since Leonard didn’t care about food. They could sit by the wood fire. Leonard liked his brandy, and maybe he’d teach her to do the same.</p>
<p>In the first raw months following Leonard’s death, as spring emerged and everything seemed to pair off, Beth had been angry at Leonard. She hadn’t even gotten to say goodbye. She’d expected he would outlive Henry, who’d had a bum knee forever, had suffered something undiagnosed that Beth was sure was a mini stroke, and whose parents died before her own and before Leonard’s. Then, Beth had thought there’d be some kind of fairness in the end. Some kind of lasting love for her too.</p>
<p>In the twilight Beth and Henry shoved the last of the gear into the Wrangler, and the women sat in the jeep, waiting for it to warm up enough to turn the heater on full. They rolled their windows down two inches, though it was probably impossible to go through the ice this late in winter. They sniffled, wiped their noses, and applied Chapstick.  Henry said, “Sir Wildgin’s taking his sweet time tonight.”</p>
<p>In the distance, someone on a ladder plugged in a floodlight above the children still at the rink. The light hung from a tree, casting an old-fashioned aura about the skaters. Beth imagined them cheering the light, though she couldn’t hear so far away. They looked like a muted Rockwell painting.</p>
<p>“That was why you left?” asked Henry. “Since Rags wouldn’t have me? No chance you’d get Leonard?”</p>
<p>Beth stared out the window at the gray, the snow racing on a blast of wind, and the tree line along the lakeshore a darker gray than anything else, except for the white haze of light at the rink. The forced intimacy of the Jeep—safe in the oncoming heat, just the two of them against the world—felt all wrong. “No.” She had hoped it wouldn’t go this far, had hoped Henry wouldn’t be hurt so there wouldn’t be all these questions, had almost hoped Henry had known so Beth wouldn’t have to lie. “I convinced you to tell Rags you loved him.” Beth watched Henry flip her jacket’s zipper, her lips smashed together, her jaw gnawing at the inside of her cheeks. This had been a very bad idea.</p>
<p>“So you could…” Henry’s voice trailed off, waiting for Beth.</p>
<p>Beth reached to turn the heater up.</p>
<p>“You said you were sick of seeing me so unhappy,” said Henry.</p>
<p>“I was.”</p>
<p>“But you wanted my Leonard for yourself.”</p>
<p>Beth dropped her voice, faced Henry. “Your Leonard? How many times did you tell me how lovesick you were? How many times did I hear the wrong brother saga?”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t mean you can love my husband.” Henry’s lips regained the blue-pink she’d crushed out of them. A few wisps of hair blew in the heater’s breath around the edge of her hat.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t mean you can love your husband’s brother.”</p>
<p>They said nothing, the heat blasting, blood pushing to numbed toes and fingers.</p>
<p>Beth wondered if Leonard asked for her during the Moratorium. If he ever even noticed she wasn’t around for dinner or to help with the butchering, the hay. That was probably it, missed as an extra pair of hands. Probably cursed for it. Maybe, in the end, forgotten.</p>
<p>“So you saw I wasn’t going to leave Leonard, and you didn’t have the balls to approach him.” Henry redirected the heater vents. “God knows he didn’t.” Another beat, then, “Why did you tell me?”</p>
<p>Beth shook her head, then blew a breath threw her tight lips. “I thought it would help.”</p>
<p>“Did it? Do you feel better?”</p>
<p>“Not me. You.”</p>
<p>“You’re too selfish for marriage.”</p>
<p>“Probably.”</p>
<p>The heater chugged, and Beth could smell the cold on their coats. She blew her nose and turned on the radio, but the choices were two pop country songs, a Ford truck commercial, and some Grateful Dead song Henry hated. Beth clicked the radio back off.</p>
<p>Beth used to imagine living in the farmhouse with Leonard—Henry and Rags run off somewhere upstate, someday to return so the four of them could sit over drinks and laugh about how well things turned out. At the farm with Leonard, it would be serene, content. Maybe some days she would get mad like Henry did that he never washed the dishes, that he spent his free time in the basement. But maybe if he was living with Beth he would want to be with her during his free time. If nothing else, she’d have what Henry didn’t complain about, a warm body next to her if she woke up from a nightmare, a person to sit across from while drinking coffee, someone to buy her medicine when she was sick. The littleness of what she wanted could make her bones ache if she let it.</p>
<p>“I thought you should know because, before, when you were so sad about Leonard—”</p>
<p>“—Don’t say his name. It’s my name to say.”</p>
<p>Beth bit her lip, tried to bite hard enough to taste blood. “When you were so sad about your husband, I thought it would help if you knew how much I missed him too. Thought we could divide up the sadness and get over it together.” She bit her lip again, and with her incisors she pinched away a small piece of tissue from her bottom lip. It tore like toilet paper, the cheap stuff at the Muni.</p>
<p>Splitting the grief was bullshit. Beth could see it now, see in herself what she wanted to hide, drop to the bottom of the lake. Again her skin flushed hot from her sternum to her hair. She closed her eyes and saw the headlines she’d made for Henry: <i>Henrietta Brasselman, Dead at 52 After Stroke </i>or when she was angriest, <i>Henrietta Brasselman Shot by Unknown Intruder.</i></p>
<p>She wanted to hurt Henry, make her feel the tiniest sliver of what she’d been left with when she couldn’t have Leonard, couldn’t have Henry, couldn’t have anything at all. There was never any real danger Henry wouldn’t keep Beth at her side, only Beth could have called the Moratorium. <i>Henry is weak for me.</i> To have this one thing. No brothers, no husband, no love but that of a transplanted farm girl.</p>
<p>Beth breathed in the tinny air of the Wrangler, watched their humid breath collect on the windshield. Her heart cleaved.</p>
<p>She put the Jeep in first, shifted to second, and drove slowly. She watched the ice houses in the rearview mirror, swallowed back her new guilt, stinging worse than the old.</p>
<p>“Stop. I want to watch them,” said Henry.</p>
<p>Just two hundred yards from the slope where Beth would have to gun Sir Wildgin to get over the hump and back onto the pavement, a hundred yards from the ice dams that lined themselves up like a mountain range, she pulled to the edge of the ice road in one of the many places blown free of snow. The heat blasted its dry, chemical smell at them. She clicked her headlights off, and again the rink was lit by the single flood light strung up in a tree on the bank.</p>
<p>For several minutes, they watched and neither of them said a word, just listened to the gusting heat and under that, the occasional cycling of the engine. The snow swirled, but it had let up a bit, and as it grew darker, the wind ebbed. Every once in a while, through the cracked windows, a shout or laughter came from the children on the ice.</p>
<p>Beth still recalled sailing the ice boat: lying down in the hull so the boom wouldn’t hit her, one hand on the tiller, the other wrapped with the sheet’s rope. A slow gathering of momentum, then a sprint as she trimmed the sail. She yanked her hat off with her roped hand, the wind’s fingers teasing her hair. Choking up on the rope: flying. Shushing blades, hurling wind. Trimming the sail, wind tugging back on her roped arm: a kind of push-pull embrace. Just the way she’d known love to be—get closer, pull back, close in, release. A sailor always had to tack, watch for pressure ridges and open water.</p>
<p>In the Wrangler, Beth pulled off her hat, and Henry did the same. The smell of Henry’s dryer sheets wafted in the Jeep. Through the windshield, from the original gang, only two boys and two girls, similar in age, siblings or friends, worked without words on a project they’d obviously done many times before. Their fire burned in a metal pit nearby. The pump, operated by a fatherish man, flooded water onto the ice. The kids spread the water with wide blade snow shovels. One of them used a towel fixed lengthwise to a board nailed to an old broom handle. Steam rose in heavy sheets from the lake water, warmer than the night. It shrouded all of them in a fine haze, a gentle blurr. As if real life could exist as it did through the Humdinger’s window.</p>
<p>Henry asked, “What do you think he wanted?”</p>
<p>Beth turned the windshield wipers to intermittent so they could watch. She could see now it wasn’t such a bad night for rink building if they kept at it, the lake water they were pumping up would melt the snow for a while. “He wanted you. I see it now.” She squinted at the boy throwing a couple more logs on the fire. “I’m sorry he’s gone, but I’m damn glad to have you back.”</p>
<p>Beth held her hands in front of the blowers, wiggled her stinging toes. Through the windows, laughter. She dropped the heat one level and heard the snowmobilers before she saw them. The engine cycled and laughter from the rink split through the crack in the windows.</p>
<p>Henry said, “Let’s go to the Muni.”</p>
<p>“They’ll ask us how we did out here.”</p>
<p>“We’ll ignore them.”</p>
<p>Beth had the better love. She doubted Leonard would have ever seen her the way Henry did now, again.</p>
<p>They watched the skaters and listened to the wind throw ice crystals against the jeep. The ice, blown clear of snow, reflected the distant spotlight. The heat still blasted. Beth pulled her fingers through her hair. The static sounded like fireworks.</p>
<p>Beth took a last look at the kids on skates. The steam rose around them, and the light, filtered through the falling snow, made them look other worldly, made them appear as if they were in slow motion. She smelled their fire and Henry’s dryer sheets. She wanted to tell Henry: look at that rink. Those kids doing this beautiful thing. Making something out of nothing. Instead of sitting. Instead of just trying to take something and not even able to do that.</p>
<p>Henry hit the gas. At the same time, she held the buttons to roll both front windows down all the way. The ice was clear, just as if a track had been plowed. Only the pressure ridge that looped around the shore would stop them. She was up to thirty miles per hour, the pedal still jammed to the floor. The engine whined, and she shifted to third, peaked at Henry, who clutched the middle console and the oh-shit bar on the door. Her eyes were wide, hair wild with static.</p>
<p>“Beth!”</p>
<p>“Henry!”</p>
<p>“Do it!” yelled Henry.</p>
<p>At forty-five miles per hour, Beth jammed the brakes, and the Jeep did a long slide. Then a tire caught, and they looped, tight and fast. Everything slowed—like the car accident when she broke her leg, like the call from Henry to say Leonard was dead. The centrifugal force glued her head to the neck rest. Out the windshield the dark lake swooped. Another tire caught, and for a moment it felt like they lifted off one side. They righted, and she turned her neck, body pressed to the seat, her belly woozy with the turning. At the sight of Henry—eyes shining, smile swabbed across her cheeks—a lump formed in Beth’s throat and the wooziness vanished. Beth wanted to woop, but a tire caught again, and again they shushed a huge circle in the ice, grays unspooling before her, uncoiling, out the window a filmstrip breaking. Wind raced in her hair. They looped again: sailing.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I didn’t believe him for the longest time. Three years since Mama’s passing, and he continued to see her. Day before the sale, I heard him scramble into his pants and flannel, laces criss-crossing, light still murky uncertain. I knew he’d caught sight of something from his bedroom window. I pulled on socks, back door swung wide. I followed him, imagined Mama’s words in my ears <i>Look after your father</i>, as if she’d known, as if somehow she’d known.</p>
<p>Outside Daddy’s boots broke dirt clots, the little land we had left went on unplowed, just stubs of corn, old mud ruts now dry. Didn’t want me to follow him. Tess! He called, my mother’s name. How had he gotten so far? Face sweat shined when I caught up to him<b>;</b> I tugged his elbow. Let’s go home, I told him, shivering with chill despite the wet heat. He took off. I heard emptiness rattle inside his shirt. He refused to eat. Said nothing tasted right. I looked up in the direction he ran, saw a woman in a grey gown and overcoat. She plodded firm. Her back to us. Tess, he said to her, please. I didn’t want what he claimed to be true. Had stood beneath the old oak, the one stone with two engraved names. Thought I remembered crying.</p>
<p>I reached him again. He put a hand up to silence me. The sky peached, moon receded. We followed her across the colorless grass and into the trees. Briars caught on the length of her gown. Glare on the river, everything lifting with fire, a new day. We came up on her. He reached a hand out to her shoulder to turn her, and she looked at us—a stranger, eyes wild and unfocused. She shoved Daddy. No weight to hold him steady—and he flew, backside hitting a maple we sometimes tapped. She kept on, Daddy dazed, egg-like lump rising on the back of his head—Tess? His face sheened white.</p>
<p>She’s dead, I reminded him.</p>
<p>Luann, your mama’s never gonna forgive me, he said, rubbing the bruise. We watched the woman descend into the river furrow, move along the dry bank.</p>
<p>That night he sat on the edge of my bed, told me that was no woman but a ghost, said ghosts were everywhere and they were nothing to fear. Your mama’s the one I’m waiting for. Bound to come back to give me her mind, losing her people’s land like this. Tried to tell him there’s no such thing as ghosts, but he gave me a hollow look, like I had no real thought in my head. I was scared and after he left I cried, covered my head with blankets. Truth be told, if she were upset with anyone it would be me. After a bit I tried to concentrate on summer sounds: peepers and gassy toads. I listened for her footsteps. Stiffened in my iron bed. Counted my breaths. Mama? It could have been ten minutes, an hour that passed when I lifted the blankets, blinked into darkness.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Mrs. Sparkman arrives early with two women from church. They set up the tables. Talk about the new priest, the upcoming pancake breakfast, the heat. They set out buckets of ice and jugs of sun tea. I bring stuff from inside the house and set it on the tables. Old clothes, the little jewelry she had. Dishes and kitchen things. A couple stained dolls. Daddy’s in the barn with the men. As we work the women ask me questions out the sides of their mouths. I am eight now. Do I like to swim? You must get lonely out here, no playmates your own age. They click their tongues. Wear looks of pity. I twirl with my arms up, white dress swirling, curls jostling to my shoulders, then stop. One hand chews up fabric in a fist. They applaud; say I am cute. And then I head back inside, don’t want them to think I can’t earn my keep.</p>
<p>Gonna be trouble later. <b>Nobody knows her people.</b></p>
<p>Hush now. Girl’s right there.</p>
<p>Mark my words.</p>
<p>More people arrive. Plastic bags hold purchases. The cash box fills. Everyone buys bits of us until only remnants are left—mismatched socks, an egg timer that doesn’t work. I hold Daddy’s hand when the auctioneer clears his throat, waves a hand in attention. The driest year Daddy can remember. July isn’t even over and the trees have already dropped their leaves. Tassels on the corn dry frittered things. Had to give up all the cows. Nothing for pasture. Nothing to pay for feed. River smells of mud, decaying fish. Vultures spoon the sky.</p>
<p>Daddy’s not the only guy Papermill laid off, he’s just the unluckiest, he says. The buckets of ice have turned to water by the time they are done. Some shake Daddy’s hand, squeeze his shoulder. Take care, now, they say. We sit on the steps and watch the train of cars leave land that has been in my mother’s family for three generations—land the bank has sold. Dust whorls. We sweat. There is no breeze.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Two days he stays in bed. Ripe with fever, sweating. I sit beside him in a chair. Hold cool cloths to his forehead. Read aloud from books I have. Sadness seeps out of him. When he sleeps, he whimpers about the land, eyes half-lidded and dancing. Daddy, wake up. It’s a dream. You are dreaming. I clap my hands around his. Callused and feathered with hairs. He blinks awake, stares. I love you, Daddy, I tell him. I count to one hundred and back down. Fan whirs in its place on the dresser top, the faintest air moving.</p>
<p>I do what I imagine Mama doing. Wipe the counters with a mixture of vinegar and water, use an old fly swatter to beat dust from the curtains. Hang laundry on the line out back. Daddy is not whole and needs nutrition, so I make a bowl of oatmeal, stir in the last bit of brown sugar. Sit at his bedside. Try to rouse him. Time to eat, Daddy. Gotta keep up your strength. But he pays me no mind and I know he is dreaming about her, that together he and Mama are making a plan. I try to push it out but cannot forget that I am not of them. At what point will I be sold, given away?</p>
<p>That night, I can’t sleep. Am afraid of what may appear if I close my eyes. Instead I wander the house, rooms empty. I go to his bedroom and stand in the doorway. Stroke his arm to make him wake. Tess? he asks.</p>
<p>It’s me, Luann. Your daughter.</p>
<p>What do you want? I don’t say anything and he scoots over. I situate myself right alongside him. The up and down of his chest and my chest. My fears evaporate. Promise I’ll just close my eyes for a moment. Then it’s morning and I wake alone. All that heat. Birds chirping, sheet pushed back, bedclothes damp and empty. Daddy? I move through rooms vacant of furniture, rugs, just a dull echo. Heart bamming away with all the silence, leaves outside sway with their crispness. Everything burned up, dying.</p>
<p>I find him toeing the ledge of the barn, that open space on the second floor that leads to nothing—bits of hay, mouse droppings. Daddy, stay there. I’m coming up. Feet sooty, eyes dancing. I scurry up the rungs. Stand behind him, smell his sourness.</p>
<p>I’m not right, he says.</p>
<p>It’s not you, it’s times, I say, and inch closer.</p>
<p>I was the one who planted that baby inside her, he says. His hair stands wild; I feel how close he is to the edge.</p>
<p>She says she misses me. Never used to say things like that. He drops his chin and I grab his middle, yank him back until he collapses on top of me, the floor holding us. We both shake, dust in my nostrils, it burns my eyes. Sun all bared and his sobbing up against me, his back to my front. Air sputters out of him in choked bits. I hold him like this for some time, tight as I am able, wish Mama would appear.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>They are building houses west of town on land that once belonged to the Doreghtys and Ryans. River’s Crossing is what the sign says. We pack a lunch and sit in the shadow of a hickory. Apples dipped in peanut butter—food the church people leave on the step. You gotta eat something, I tell him, just like I imagine her saying. I know, he says, palming a whole apple.</p>
<p>We sit so long waiting for Mama that my backside begins to tingle. She’s different now, he says. Ingleside is different, too. The deer thin and sickly looking. Smallmouth bass used to leap into a net extended from Red Arrow Bridge, now they are pale scrawny things that barely ribbon the water; Daddy refuses to eat them. The bridge is near Papermill and Daddy won’t go near that side of town.</p>
<p>The bulldozers gnash the ground, drop black soil in mounds; the earth clean smelling, rich looking, but the top layer blows away—dust coats our eyes, lines the insides of our fingers and toes. The houses have long peaked roofs and attached garages. Doors tall enough to let in giants. Tiny octagonal signs advertise security systems. The workmen hammer and drill, their backs bare and tanned. We wait until the last crew drives off and then I follow him down to where the blacktop ends and the for-sale signs disappear. We head in a ways past drought-stricken trees to the crumbling brick of a hearth. Can see where the foundation stood—cinderblocks streaked black. The frame of a door and two windows beside that. He moves through the area, boots catch on reams of honeysuckle, crush weeds. He keeps walking around as if he’s trying to decide something. Stops. They think you would be better off elsewhere. Living with someone else….his voice trails off. Won’t look at me. He opens and closes his hands. Palms his neck, the side of his face that still doesn’t look right—skin bumpy and disjointed.</p>
<p>I squint up at him. He starts walking again. A breeze curdles up from somewhere else. Dries the sweat on my neck where my hair is pulled back. I feel like crying. When he keeps to his silence I go and grab him. Hold him by the pant loops. I want to stay with you, I say. Watch the crazy panning of his eyes. He’s here but not here. He lifts his arms a bit, does a half spin, gestures, and I turn with him. He talks. This used to be the kitchen. Right here. My mother and father. The twins sat on either side of mother. My brothers. He’s stroking his neck again, the warpled skin, and I know he smells the smoke, feels everything crashing and ripping down around him, and then the fire streaming from him. He runs a hand on the brick. Rubs it back and forth like the tracings we’ve made at school, only he’s pressing down with his wrist, and the skin’s getting all scraped up and dotted with red.</p>
<p>As he talks, pictures begin to appear in my mind and I wonder if this is what it’s like to see things. To be ghost haunted just like him. He points to the brush, to nothingness. I try to force the image of his dead family. I want to be more like him except in this way.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The first time he saw a ghost he was just a boy, out hunting pheasant with his brother and father. His mother was at home preparing the dressing. He held the gun in front of him, one hand on the stock, the other the barrel. He was a careful boy, a boy who wanted to please; he saw a flock of birds, aimed but the birds scattered before he could fire—hot heat poured from his arm, and he fell over at the sight of his blood spilling out onto the grass. His younger brother unaware of his misplaced shot. Too frightened yet to scream, little flap of skin on his arm, white flash of bone beneath. And then a man slipped out from the trees, a big man, dark hoodless eyes, skin as brown as deer hide. He snuck out, seemed to appear from the tall grass. The man passed a hand over my daddy’s arm and the blood dried up, went away altogether. The seam that had ripped open his arm disappeared. His skin again whole. Just a few stains on the grass to let him know it had occurred. By the time his brother found him, the man had evaporated into the trees.</p>
<p>He told his father he thought he saw Jesus. Son, he said, you must pray that happens in your lifetime.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Once the bank took down the sign from out front, the papers for the new owners filed, <b>Mama</b> came more frequently. I heard my daddy at the kitchen table with his checkbook and the security box late into the night, and then the chair would push back suddenly and he’d up and leave. I learned to sleep lightly, to keep my sneakers tied. I’d keep a thermos of water near the door, would grab it on the way out. Never knew how long it would take, where he would go. Sometimes he wanted to be left alone—turned the handle as he closed the door soft and careful, and then I’d hear his boots thwaping the ground, and he’d be off. I followed his slim shape, pumped my arms to keep up. His chest heaved, a comfort to me. I followed him across a rise into trees, then over a low wooden bridge, the river still beneath us. Tess! He cried, voice mournful. I did not see anything but his slight shape, the river’s decay heavy and rich. He pointed out her shape in the movement of some shrubs. I stared long and hard and still she did not appear. But I’d watch with him, and the longer we sat the more ghosts he saw: black people ragged and knobby kneed, faces clenched as they clamored the ground, crouched like animals amid brambles and dead leaves as they headed further north. One time I stood there beside my father as he said a whole troop of them trudged in tattered clothes, faces worn. Twenty, thirty of them. A baby cried and a woman lifted the child to her breast. We stood there and that time I did feel cool air moving. Had always knows the route to the Underground Railroad cut right through these parts, my mama’s people offered food, shelter. But I didn’t see a thing.</p>
<p>The woman with the child held her out to Daddy and he turned away, grabbed my shoulder, told me to start walking and fast. It’s one thing to see them, he said. Another thing altogether when they start seeing you.</p>
<p>And then nothing is as it seems. I find the skull of a squirrel, poke it with a stick, but then I see it whole, running along the underbrush, up a tree.</p>
<p>What is real, what is imagined?</p>
<p>He tells me how the land was different before they adopted me, how he planted acres of corn and soybeans—more than<b> seventy beef cattle</b>. Used to make enough to attend the movies on Saturday nights, a nice ham and turkey at Christmastime.</p>
<p>We sit on the porch. Watch the sun beat the scabbed grasses, what by now should have been corn throwing shadows on our legs, leaves brushing up against each other in a soft whisper. He tells a story for every plot—points out where he first glimpsed my mother from behind a milking pail, the hill where he shot a buck; over there is where he says I took my first steps. You need to remember this, he says. I won’t always be here. Where are you going, I ask, but he does not answer.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Our last night and the house is empty. I make Daddy drive me to Welmann’s where I use all our coupons on butter and sour cream, potatoes, eggs, ground beef. I make him dinner. Meatloaf with mashed potatoes pooling with gravy, buttered carrots in a glossy sheen. Now you eat, I say, one hand on hip. My best mama pose. I watch him touch the food on the chipped plate; the fork tines leave a ribbed impression, gravy floods from his potatoes. But he won’t eat. His eyes have already started to pop from his face, excavating the bones on his cheeks. This worries me. All the fears climbing on top of each other. I finish my glass of milk, wipe my mouth and stand. I have already fixed quarters to the bottom of my shoes, tap in a little circle on the linoleum, finish with my arms up, ta-dah! He claps a few hands, says that is real nice, although he doesn’t mean it. His eyes seemed to brighten. Yes, yes, he says, nodding. Yes, she is.</p>
<p>Who you speaking to? I ask.</p>
<p>He chuckles, stubble on his beard flecked with white. It’s your mama.</p>
<p>I don’t see her.</p>
<p>She’s right over there. I walk in the direction he points, push my face in the corner of the room. Mama! It’s Luann. You talk to me right now, and I stomp.</p>
<p>Don’t take that tone with her, he says. She’s still your mama.</p>
<p>Show yourself! I demand. Begin to think maybe Daddy really is crazy because there’s no one here but us.</p>
<p>We unroll blankets on the living room floor but it is too hot to even blink. Moths flick against the light outside the barn and I wonder about the land. We aren’t the only ones bought out by developers. Somehow I doze. Wake to buzzing, the click of the latch. Daddy?</p>
<p>Can hear him shuffling away in his boots. Slide on my sneakers. He hasn’t gotten far. Once I fall into step behind him he begins to run and I follow him. Daddy! Wait! I have a four-leaf clover pressed between sheets of waxed paper, the Bible from Mama’s family. A bit of hair I cut from her when she was pregnant and napping and not yet dead. But I doubt any of this will work. Please stop!</p>
<p>He runs until he arrives downtown a good two miles from our house. Both of us sweaty and breathless when he slows in front of the ice cream parlor. He visors his hands around his eyes, presses his face into the glass. She’s fixing something, he says, <b>sweat puddles</b> the back of his shirt and at his armpits. I look through the window. See the counter with its striped stools. Booths with napkin dispensers. I don’t see anybody. Why won’t she show herself to me?</p>
<p>It’s hot fudge, he says. Yow-wee. Extra cherries, Tess! You know it.</p>
<p>Behind us the sign for Bremeyer’s Department Store glows red. Beside it for-sale signs and realtors, all those panes of glass swallow his sound, send it right back up at us. Hey! he says, brows drawn, mouth tightening. This way.</p>
<p>I tug his elbow. Let’s go back. Rush my mind to get him to turn around, head home. The animals are gone. Land sold. We should go back, I say.</p>
<p>Don’t you want ice cream, Luann? He put a hand around my shoulder as he says this, looks right into my face as he speaks. Your mama is right there, and she’s making us a treat. I look into the shop. Want to see something. Memories of my mother have evaporated to a kind of blurred uncertainty. Tess! He rattles the door handle. Let me in. His voice skims across empty storefronts, the two storey brick buildings. He picks up a cement ashtray parked next to a bench, heaves it up, veins in his neck popping. Daddy, I say, stepping forward, don’t do something you’re going to regret. He elbows me away and in one movement swings the ashtray through the door; glass shatters, a bell goes off, surprising us both.</p>
<p>He charges into the parlor, heels crunching and skidding on glass. Tess? His arm bloody. The alarm won’t quit.</p>
<p>Daddy, I say, Let’s go. He is behind the counter now palming the space. Lights flash red and blue, a siren. His blood pinks the smoothness.</p>
<p>She was right here. I saw her. He starts opening and closing the cabinets. Looking behind closet doors.</p>
<p>We’ve got to go. She’s not here. And while I know he hasn’t forgotten, know it pains to hear it, I remind him. She’s in the ground on the hill. The sheriff comes in then. What’s all this about, Teensy? he asks my daddy, and I feel the familiar pride as he steps forward, takes Daddy’s hand. Sometimes they hunt together.  Once delivered a calf for the sheriff’s son and his wife. Everybody likes Daddy.</p>
<p>Daddy shakes his head, offers a half shrug. The sheriff presses paper napkins to the wound. It’s hard times, is what Daddy says.</p>
<p>That it is, says the sheriff. Don’t need to take it out on private property, you hear? He claps both hands on Daddy’s shoulders and shakes them. You hear me? Gonna have to pay for this, he says. Daddy promises he will and the sheriff offers us a ride in his car. I let myself in the backseat. Daddy’s in front.</p>
<p>People are starting to talk, Teensy, he says, turns on the air conditioning, and the first icy blasts change my skin to plastic.</p>
<p>So let them talk.</p>
<p>I mean really talk. You’ve got to get hold of yourself or someone’s gonna do it for you. You got a daughter. He looks at me in the rear mirror, forces a dopey smile. Think of Luann.</p>
<p>You think I don’t know that. You think she’s not on my mind constant? So tired everyone telling me what’s right, what I can and cannot do. You people are killing me. His voice escalates and he’s angry. Let me out, he says, working the door.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Daddy punches the door open and rolls out into the grass. The car jerks to a stop. Insects dart in the beams from the car, that long road stretched before us. The sheriff <b>swings his door ajar</b> and sticks his head out. I could take you in, Teensy. You know that? He follows Daddy in the car, the headlights catching shots of his back or legs as Daddy walks and we all head home.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The next day is like any other. We roll up the blankets and huck them in the back of the truck. The door rattles in its frame as he shuts it, house empty of us. Daddy drives to Grandma’s house, empties boxes from the back of the truck and puts them in the basement. I don’t answer him when he asks me if I’m ready, then turns toward Mrs. Sparkman’s house. Still don’t believe him when he says Grandma can’t care for me. Say the truth, I think. She doesn’t like me. Not of her kind.</p>
<p>He promises that he’ll be back in a week. Tells me to mind my manners. He’s going to Savoy for a few days to see about a job. He sets my bag just inside the door where Mrs. Sparkman tells him to leave it. Her house is warmer than outside and smells of stewed tomatoes. He gives me a hard hug. You be good now, he says.</p>
<p>As his truck pulls away, Mrs. Sparkman waves a handkerchief from the porch, her bosom swelling against the cabbage roses on her housedress. I refuse to look at him. Peer at ground. I hear him turn his truck around in the grass. Dust lifts up. I try to ground my heels in the dirt, but I can’t do it. Don’t want to stay here, am not going be left behind. Mrs. Sparkman calls my name, tells me to come back. Pump my puny arms, and here I run beside the truck. He slouches over the wheel. Won’t look at me. He has the window down, the knob of an elbow out. I’m almost even with him when he gives it gas and shoots forward—and I choke on all that dust, bend over and spit cough, and when I stand up again I see her a ways off in the crest of a hill, my mama’s unmistakable step. Her nightdress is faded but there is a rise in the belly, that almost baby. I see her now. Wave my arms—she’s right here! Daddy, wait!</p>
<p>I believe you, I say, she’s here! His truck keeps on, dust in its wake. Mom! I call, a word I rarely say, and raise a hand. When she doesn’t look up I take off in her direction. She has shown herself to us both. But I will be the one to force her to remain.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had a neighbor who said she kept a whistle by the telephone. Whenever a telemarketer called, she&#8217;d blow the whistle into the phone&#8217;s receiver. I wasn&#8217;t sure whether this was a terrible or a brilliant idea. Her name was Helen, and for ten years, she lived across the street from me. Helen was a nurse. She worked evenings and some weekends on the cardiology floor of the children&#8217;s hospital. I didn&#8217;t see her often, but when I did, it was usually from my porch. We&#8217;d wave at each other across our lawns, then she&#8217;d say something, but of course I couldn&#8217;t hear her, our voices lost in all that landscaping. Inevitably we&#8217;d get up and walk slowly across the grass, and for a few minutes, standing by our mailboxes, we&#8217;d talk.</p>
<p>Helen&#8217;s stories were mostly about kids with bad hearts, hearts that pumped too fast, or not fast enough, or hard enough, stories where the kids aren&#8217;t necessarily going to get better. I&#8217;m sure there were lots of uplifting stories too, but Helen didn&#8217;t share those stories with me, just the sad ones. As far as I knew, Helen had never married. She lived alone. Boyfriend, maybe, though I never saw him. There were cats, a pair of them. I&#8217;d been inside her house maybe five times in that many years.</p>
<p>&#8220;So whatever happened with the raccoons?&#8221; I asked her one evening. As we stood in the road, the sun seemed to take a deep breath before falling behind the mountains.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen them in a few days,&#8221; Helen said. &#8220;But they&#8217;ll be back.&#8221; She folded her arms over her scrubs. The air had grown colder, and Helen&#8217;s porch light came on.  The row of trees by my driveway looked like motionless giants. I looked past them to my house, two rectangles of  light winking through the leaves, and then I was alone in the dark seclusion of my living room, Friday night, can opener in one hand, TV remote in the other.</p>
<p>It started to rain. Just a whisper on the roof at first, then a steady downpour. I stood up and walked to the window, listening to water rushing from the gutters.</p>
<p>There is one story in particular, the story of a boy with liver disease. He was not under Helen&#8217;s care, but being a friend&#8217;s son, she stopped in frequently to check on him. This boy was very young, only six when he died. Toward the end, his skin grew waxy and began to turn orange, until even his eyes took a yellow tint. I imagine him often, curled up on his hospital bed, sucking on a sheet corner with his sandpaper tongue. That was not a boy, I sometimes think.</p>
<p>The phone rang. It was Helen. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry Mark,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I know it&#8217;s raining. But he&#8217;s back. The big male with the stripe over his eye. Can you come?&#8221;</p>
<p>Of all the things Helen tried&#8211;a cinderblock, a bungee cord over the lid&#8211;the raccoon was one step ahead of her, leaving a trail of garbage down her driveway for her to pick up in the morning.<br />
&#8220;I just don&#8217;t get it,&#8221; Helen said, standing beside me in her kitchen. &#8220;They make such a mess, and I hardly ever hear them.&#8221;</p>
<p>It started with a chicken carcass, the bones found hanging from her shrubs like deranged Christmas ornaments. Then the little wooden owl went missing from her porch, the one holding a set of spare house keys. Soon after, a bag of cat litter left on the porch overnight was split down the middle. &#8220;Quite the mess,&#8221; Helen said.</p>
<p>&#8220;So where is he?&#8221; I asked, looking through the window at her rain-slick driveway.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the thing,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t actually see him this time. I just heard him scratching the garage door. I know he&#8217;s out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen left the kitchen. When she returned, she handed me a towel. My sneakers had made a pool of water on the tile. &#8220;You&#8217;re soaking,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Whatever happened to rain coats?&#8221; There was something about doctors and nurses, the way they moved, and spoke, islands of hope in the middle of all that sadness. I always thought they carried a certain kind of grace.</p>
<p>The boy with the orange skin was always thirsty. Helen brought him ice cubes wrapped in paper towels. The boy used the ice to wet his chapped lips, and then he let the ice melt against his swollen cheeks, and on the puffy crescents under his eyes.  Doctors allowed him cups of water, little six ounce Styrofoam cups that were never enough. The boy&#8217;s eyes flashed around the room, looking for familiar faces, for Helen, maybe, but mostly for his father. Where was his father? His eyes were like marbles, orange and glassy. Doll&#8217;s eyes. His skin seemed to molt, flaking away and falling onto the linoleum.</p>
<p>The rain was coming down hard now. Wind pushed the rain sideways, a flurry of stars sparking under the flood lamp before fading into nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have an idea,&#8221; Helen said. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s the lights. Let&#8217;s turn them off and see if he comes back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what?&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>Helen turned off the porch lamp, followed by the kitchen lights, until it was just us standing in the dark, listening to the rain and the sound of our own breathing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I need to tell you something, Mark,&#8221; Helen said. She paused. The house seemed to sigh under the pressure of the wind.</p>
<p>&#8220;About the raccoon?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who gives a fuck about the raccoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>The thing about the boy is this: it was more than just the story of a boy with a bad liver, a boy who was dying alone in the hospital. It was also the story of the father who was afraid to visit him. Afraid of what, exactly? Afraid of the boy? Of himself?</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I understand now,&#8221; Helen said. &#8220;I thought of you alone in your house and I just needed to tell you that. Not that it makes a difference. But I think I understand why you stopped coming to visit your boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>Helen had said what she needed to say, and now she was quiet.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t just Helen&#8217;s story, though she was a part of it. It was a story about the boy, and it was a story about the father.</p>
<p>I looked outside, but it was just the rain and the wind and the trees swaying in the dark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I turn on the lights now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay,&#8221; Helen said.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first test of Filadelfio Vera’s resolve came on a hot day. From the instant he climbed into the Jeep he did not stop sweating. All morning long, rivulets ran down his legs and collected in his socks. They ran down his back, pooling at his belt. By chance, it was also the day that the world rankings for corrupt countries came out. Paraguayans were used to seeing their country classified with the lowest of the low. This time, because of his new job, the news had special meaning for Filo. He was a recruit in the national police, and he intended to stay clean. The problem was the dirt. To get from where you stood to where you wanted to stand, you had to take steps. That was logical. But any place you put your foot down, it came up filthy.</p>
<p>Thanks to a whim of his mother’s, Filadelfio was the only person in Paraguay named after a Mennonite colony in the Chaco Desert. Christmas had fallen midway through Milagros’ pregnancy, and the glass of clericó her uncle served her was sweet. She drank the wine, nibbled the fruit, and announced that the child growing inside her would pay homage to the industrious farmers who had made the desert bloom. To those who knew Filo growing up, the unusual name marked him out. His mother had willed him to be different, and he was.</p>
<p>Sergeant Duarte, in charge of the police station at Salto, had seventeen years on the force. He carried his experience like body fat and moved slowly, breathing ostentatiously through his beak. Duarte complained of allergies, and a lack of respect from his lover now she was turning nineteen. Sending them out on patrol, he patted the hood of the Jeep with a horny hand. “Keep your eyes open.”</p>
<p>Even Filo, greenest of the four on board, knew that meant they should turn a blind eye. If they arrested someone who enjoyed police protection, the wrath of the sergeant would fall on their heads.</p>
<p>They drove into the sun, joking about making a sensational arrest. They were young, lean, and full of talk. Mostly what they talked about was the contraband flowing across the Paraná into Brazil, or vice versa, depending on the article in question. Filo listened. Before taking the job he had thought it through and decided he would not worry about consumer goods. Nobody could stop the flow of whiskey and DVDs and Hello Kitty purses, and where was the harm? Drugs were something else. So were weapons. How could you call yourself a policeman and not concern yourself with serious matters affecting the well being of the nation?</p>
<p>Black was black, and white was white. That was his father’s answer to any hard question that came up. Hilario was deaf and dumb, born that way. He made bricks, working alone in a silence Filo grew to understand as a kind of private island no enemy boat could approach. At home, when Hilario had something important to say, he wrote it with chalk on a blackboard the Belgian missionary had procured for him years ago. The law he laid down on slate never varied. Black was black, and white was white. His father’s son, his mother’s son, Filo did not fail to absorb the lesson.</p>
<p>The other cops ribbed him without mercy. An earnestness he had not learned to hide brought it out in them. After a half hour of aimless driving they dropped him at a brushy thicket alongside the big green river. Behind the wheel, Gomez squinted, pointing with his cigarette. “See that tree? If it moves, arrest it.”</p>
<p>It was funny so everybody laughed, Filo included. Gomez had a year and a half in the service and knew how things worked. Filo watched them drive off. He watched the red dust settle in the road. Then he found a place in the shade, leaned his rifle against the tree he was supposed to arrest, and relaxed. He didn’t mind working alone. The solitude gave him time to think about Maia, and the baby on its way. His mother had cried when he told her the girl was pregnant, not because she disliked Maia – she was fond of her – but because it portended the end of her son’s ambition. Filo was realistic enough to know she was likely right.</p>
<p>Still, no matter what the future brought, he intended to hang onto his good habits. In school, the teachers had used Filo to show how talented they were. He could memorize anything. Once, when he was twelve, a supervisor from the education ministry came to the school for a graduation ceremony. She was a formidable truck of a woman with a dictator’s voice. The director of the school had made Filo memorize the capital cities of the fifty North American states, an easy assignment, really. The woman from the ministry understood that his talent had nothing to do with the teachers. She put their noses out of joint by hauling him into the director’s office, slamming the door in their faces. She took a seat behind the desk and looked at him for a long little while, absently tugging at the strap of her brassiere in a way that distracted him. Apart from the tremble of flesh what he remembered, at this distance, was her advice. You have something special, boy. When you figure out what it is, don’t sell it cheap.</p>
<p>Well, failing to learn what it was, or what it was good for, he had sold cheap.</p>
<p>For the discipline of it, standing under the tree he ran through the names of the capitals of all the departments in Paraguay, and then the major rivers of Canada. That worked one level of his mind. On another level, he felt an agreeable sexual stir thinking about Maia. Since they had learned she was pregnant, she had gotten into the habit of lying in bed on her back at night, legs spread, guiding his hand across her belly tracing the imagined outline of their child. That was a nice thing to think about, but he shook it off. He was working.</p>
<p>He roused himself and strolled down to the edge of the river where dragonflies with nervous wings made erratic turns in the thick air. Ten meters out, a fish jumped twice, flashing pale green. This was supposed to be a regular launching spot for boats crossing to Brazil. In full daylight he did not expect to see anything brazen but wondered what he would do if a boat came in, loaded with perfume and football jerseys. He wasn’t sure. He went back to the tree and sat crosslegged in the grass with his back against the trunk.</p>
<p>Butterflies collected where sap ran, fluttering drunk. A jet black beetle with antlers climbed a stalk, causing it to bend just a little. Out in the road, a khaki cow shuffled by with a board collar hanging broken from its neck. Filo felt funny. He became aware of the breathing of giant lungs, a regular and reassuring sound. He was resting on an invisible tray, offered up to the owner of the lungs. Somewhere a colossal cup collected all the tears that had been cried since the beginning of time.</p>
<p>He took the feeling of jubilant wholeness that came over him not as a sign but as a hint. Could it be he was meant, after all, to be a policeman? What happened next reinforced the hint. He heard labored breathing and got quietly to his feet, as startled when he saw him as the kid he surprised. The kid was carrying a sack over his shoulder, struggling with the awkward weight of it. When he saw Filo’s uniform he dropped the sack and took off running.</p>
<p>Filo’s mistake was stopping to look inside the sack just long enough to see tightly packed bricks of marijuana. The kid was barefoot and knew where he was going, and those few seconds gave him a head start. Filo grabbed his rifle and lit out after him; cops did not leave their weapons behind. The kid followed a grown-over path through brush along the river for half a kilometer. When he made a sudden move toward the road Filo lunged, getting a hand on his shoulder and yanking. They went down in a tangle though Filo was careful to keep the rifle out of harm’s way, as he had been trained to do.</p>
<p>In the fray, notwithstanding the heel to the groin he took, he thought, I love this. I love enforcing the law. It was exhilarating. But fear gave his opponent the strength of desperation, and he wriggled free and ran again. Filo’s groin was tender where he had been kicked, and he could no longer keep up. You didn’t shoot a kid in the back for transporting a few kilos of marijuana, so he watched him disappear before going back to claim the sack.</p>
<p>When Gomez and the others came by to pick him up, they were puzzled what to do with the marijuana. Filo asserted himself. Black was black, and white was white. He insisted they take it back with them. They rode back to Salto in an uneasy silence, not sure what to expect from their boss. But Duarte only muttered when he learned what Filo had done. He cursed sideways saying,</p>
<p>“It’s evidence. Lock it in the storeroom.”</p>
<p>Filo carried the sack inside, deposited it on a shelf, and snapped the padlock shut on the door to the storeroom at the back of the station. When he turned around, there was Duarte telling him he had a lot to learn about the job.</p>
<p>“Sí, mi sargento,” Filo agreed. It was true. He had a lot to learn.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was chance that took him and Maia near the police station on their evening walk, perhaps not. Filo had read that pregnant women should stay in shape, it made the birth easier. Regardless, it was pleasant to stroll the sandy streets as the sun was going down, feeling sweet relief as the heat of the day drained away and the evening reached a civilized temperature. They walked every night.</p>
<p>The station was an adobe building painted blue, with a bar of dark red running around the base. In front stood a hitching rail nobody used anymore. The windows were barred. Not just those of the two tiny cells but all of them, which Filo found emblematic. The bars reinforced the sense of menace the station projected, daring citizens to imagine what it would be like to find themselves on the inside looking out.</p>
<p>It was getting dark. Bats were hunting bugs across the violet velvet air. Approaching the station Filo took Maia by the arm and shushed her. She had been telling him about one of those television shows where famous people danced in a contest and then talked about how they felt. The new policeman and his wife stood there in the dusk watching Sergeant Duarte come out the front door of the station carrying the sack of marijuana that Filo had impounded. He looked up and down the street out of habit but did not see them. He threw the sack in the back seat of his car, a Brazilian VW, and drove off.</p>
<p>“He told me I have a lot to learn about being a policeman,” Filo told Maia.</p>
<p>“And, are you learning?”</p>
<p>He leaned close, smelled his wife’s scent of unnamable flowers, and kissed her on the cheek. “Yes, my love. I am learning.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>They were spending too much time talking about money, a subject that exasperated Filo. Maia understood the system. She knew that, sooner rather than later, he would be offered the chance to supplement the pittance he earned each month. The longer he stayed on the force, the greater the opportunities that would come his way. It was reasonable to think a man in his position might someday have the wherewithal to purchase a car, build a house, properly educate his children. Maia wanted all of those things, as well she should. But she also understood the man she had married. She would not pressure him to do violence to what she called his Filadelfio principles. The money talk was a kind of compulsion, but it served to remind them who they were not.</p>
<p>The heat of December impressed itself on Salto, embedded itself in every animate creature, every inanimate object. Look up the street, you saw waves shimmering like bright snakes. The heat hugged you close, it kissed you with poison lips. You sweated through your shower. Ice floes clogged your daydreams, carrying penguins expelling chilled air as they barked for help. If you went to the Paraná you could practically see it evaporating, invisible sheets of water rising from the surface of the river into the saturated atmosphere. Filo and Maia slept with the windows open, a fan blasting to keep off the mosquitoes. She slept poorly, waking to guide his hand with hers across the unmapped continent of her swelling belly.</p>
<p>The sky had been overcast all day the evening that Duarte sent Filo’s squad out on patrol with an order you could take two ways. It wasn’t true that the webwork of gray clouds kept the air any cooler, but it was useful to pretend it did.</p>
<p>“Do your duty,” Sergeant Duarte said. “Don’t come back empty handed.”</p>
<p>It was guns. Filo knew it in his gut, and he was right. Gomez drove the jeep to the same spot on the river where they had left him the first time. Filo recognized the tree where he had rested, remembered the exhilaration he had felt, chasing the kid who got away. Gomez switched off the engine, but for a moment nobody moved. Filo perceived a kind of solemnity in the squad, arising from a feeling of purpose. They were playing their part in a ritual they did not completely grasp. Gomez broke the spell, telling them to get moving. In a few minutes the sun would go down. The night bugs were already testing their voices.</p>
<p>They went single file south along the river bank, moving quietly under the cover of high trees with drooping fronds, dense bushes with fat, thick bodies that got fatter and thicker as the light waned. After twenty minutes’ walking, they picked up the sound of business. Boxes were being stacked, men were blowing spent air from their lungs and cursing in low voices. Metal on metal, metal on Mother Earth. But before they saw what they had come to see, a guard with a Kalashnikov stood blocking their way on the path.</p>
<p>He had a gold tooth and a hard face. He had muscles and tattoos. He wore no shirt, just a leather vest that gave him the look of a movie cowboy. Filo knew what pathology meant and recognized that this guy had been hired by bosses because he lacked empathy with his fellow man.</p>
<p>“What do you sons of bitches want?”</p>
<p>Gomez knew what to do. This was not the first time he had led a squad into a tricky situation. He had thought through his lines. “What’s going on, back there behind you?”</p>
<p>“Whatever it is, it’s none of your goddamn business.”</p>
<p>“We’re the police,” said Gomez, warming to his role, liking it; liking, even, going up against a man in a vest with a world-famous weapon. “Our business is whatever we say it is.”</p>
<p>They were speaking in Guaraní, but the guy with the Kalashnikov had a Brazilian accent. That made it come out like clown talk, and Filo couldn’t help smiling.</p>
<p>“What’s so funny?”</p>
<p>Filo shook his head. No sense making things worse. He made an effort to eradicate the smile, and it went away.</p>
<p>“We’re going to have to inspect those boxes of yours,” Gomez said, reaching for irony but not quite achieving it.</p>
<p>“What boxes?”</p>
<p>“The ones your friends are tossing around.” He pointed. “Back there. Who knows, they might contain contraband, and we’d have to arrest you.”</p>
<p>“Who sent you?”</p>
<p>Gomez could not answer him with Sergeant Duarte’s name. That was not how the thing was done. Black was black, thought Filo reflexively, and white was white. He understood that nothing would happen until Gomez and the guard with the gold tooth were tired of feeling each other out. It was a chest-thumping exercise, sure, but that was only part of it. The rest had to do, obscurely but surely, with money. It ended ten minutes later with the delivery of an envelope to Gomez. The envelope was grubby. Trudging back toward the jeep in the gathered gloom, the policemen were disappointed not to have had a glimpse of the cargo being readied to cross the river. Filo, too. But his disappointment was doubled because he had to admit to himself that he had failed to do the right thing.</p>
<p>Of course he had the whole drive back to Salto, watching the cones of the headlights bore jumpy holes in the darkness, to think about how to make up for it. At the station, Gomez went into Duarte’s office with the sergeant and came out five minutes later with money in pale blue envelopes for everyone in the squad. Filo refused to take his.</p>
<p>“What do you mean, you don’t want it?” Gomez said. He had one restless eye, which was of a lighter color than the other and moved independently. The eye aggravated Filo. “You earned it.”</p>
<p>Filo shook his head, said it again. “Ndai potái.”</p>
<p>Gomez shrugged. Filo saw him wondering whether he should share out Filo’s cut to the rest of the squad, or take it back to the sergeant. Being cautious, he disappeared again into Duarte’s office. Filo wanted to keep it simple, keep it clean. He felt dirty. Anyway the shift was over. He went out the door and walked home and showered. That night, for the first time, he felt the baby’s tiny kick.</p>
<p>That was not the end of the matter, nor did he expect it would be. The next day, Duarte asked him if he knew how to drive. Filo told him he didn’t.</p>
<p>“Then you’re going to learn.”</p>
<p>He grabbed Filo by the arm and dragged him out of the station. It did not take long. Filo was good with mechanical things and in fifteen minutes he was comfortably working the clutch and the gear shift of the official vehicle. He liked it. Driving gave him a sense of control he was not accustomed to experiencing. He followed the directions his sergeant gave him and wound up parked in front of a small pink house on the outskirts of Salto. The house was notable for its tidy aspect. The front yard was free of weeds. The shutters were freshly painted. They went around the side of the house to the back patio where they found a beautiful woman sweeping up leaves.</p>
<p>“Nanci,” said Duarte, “This is Filadelfio Vera. He is a policeman, like me.”</p>
<p>Nanci stopped sweeping and smiled at Filo. She was as dazzling a woman as he had ever seen. Long dark hair a little wild, a tall body with prominent breasts and shapely arms, skin the color of copper, a face you might see stamped on an ancient coin. A queen’s face. She pointed them to plastic chairs under the shade of a grapefruit tree, and Filo marveled how a woman as young and perfect as she was could find an ugly man like Duarte acceptable. She served them tereré in a polished cowhorn on which the figure of a bull was carved. The straw through which they drank the tea was genuine silver, not aluminum. It had to be a present from Duarte.</p>
<p>“Here’s the problem,” said the sergeant, sucking loudly on the straw, then handing her the cowhorn.</p>
<p>She turned a face of vicious innocence on him. “Where?”</p>
<p>“Vera is like that saint, what’s his name? The animals loved him. Birds landed on his shoulder.”</p>
<p>“Francis of Assisi.”</p>
<p>“That’s the one. I keep telling Vera there’s no place for a saint in a police station. What we need are realists.”</p>
<p>Nanci nodded thoughtfully. “I see. You think he ought to be more like you. Interdict marijuana and resell it. Shake down businessmen. Fuck a woman who isn’t his wife and tell her lies she might possibly believe for a certain period of time. Go on telling the same lies after she stops believing them.”</p>
<p>Duarte shrugged. “I never had a son, you know.”</p>
<p>“What about me?” said Filo. “Don’t I get to say anything?”</p>
<p>Nanci handed him the tereré. “Nobody’s stopping you.”</p>
<p>“I never wanted to be a policeman.”</p>
<p>She asked him, “What did you want to be?”</p>
<p>Filo thought for a moment, wanting not so much to be truthful as accurate. “I thought I might have my own television show.”</p>
<p>Duarte snorted but managed to ask him, “What kind of show?”</p>
<p>“Like a quiz show. We would invite guests, qualified and intelligent guests, to ask me questions.”</p>
<p>Nanci saw where he was headed. “They would ask very hard questions, but you would know the answers.”</p>
<p>“I can memorize anything.”</p>
<p>She shook her head. “It wouldn’t work.”</p>
<p>“How come?”</p>
<p>“Nobody watching the show at home would believe that one man knew all those answers.”</p>
<p>“But I would know,” he insisted. “That’s the thing. I would always know.”</p>
<p>“She’s right,” Duarte added in a flat voice that put an end to the discussion. “It wouldn’t work.”</p>
<p>It was the first time in Filo’s experience that he had gone through a conversation that had nothing to do with the words coming out of the mouths of the people having it. He understood he was being warned, and that Duarte believed he was acting in Filo’s best interest. The next time they went out on patrol, Duarte ordered Gomez to let Filo drive. Gomez didn’t much like that but saluted and handed Filo the key. All the way to the river Filo had the sensation of being watched by Gomez’s independent eye.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was a philosophical question, the kind of thing Filo found stimulating. If a given place on the planet – say, Salto, in Paraguay – started off very hot, what did it mean to get hotter? He craved a philosophical answer but none came. All he had were examples. A lizard on a brick at three in the afternoon begging for mercy. Sunburnt ants. The breath going into your lungs hotter than the air you expelled. The stifled songs of birds. Start paying attention and heat was like God, part of everything, source and destination, the main idea and the fire burning it out.</p>
<p>Approaching Christmas, the heavy odor of coco flowers sweetened the scorched air, and the woman next door mixed  a pitcher of clericó. Tasting it, Filo thought about his mother and took the bus out of town to Campo Florido. He arrived at siesta time when both his parents were asleep in leather hammocks out back under the shade of stumpy trees. His father was a light sleeper and sat up the instant Filo put his foot down. They spoke in shorthand sign language, and Filo got an answer to the question he did not quite know how to pose. Black was black, his father’s arthritic brown hands slashed, and white was white.</p>
<p>The baby kept growing in Maia’s womb, a vow unto itself. Filo bought a child-care book and read it aloud to his wife, trying to distract her from the heat which was making her pregnancy a trial. Once, they visited Filo’s schoolfriend Paquito and the woman he was living with. Idoya wanted a car. That was fine, it was a normal desire. But she wanted it so badly she was pushing Paquito to take a job with one of the contraband kings. Filo wanted his friend to say no, nothing could induce him to take the job, but only mush came out of Paquito’s mouth. All the way home Filo fretted, and by some mysterious troubling connection he felt responsible that night when Maia shook him awake in terrible pain.</p>
<p>“The baby is dying,” she gasped.</p>
<p>He did what he could to soothe her, which was nothing. Her tears convinced him to go out and find a pharmacy. Since he’d known her, Maia had not cried once. Afraid, he trotted through the sandy streets toward a place whose owner he thought he might be able to roust out of bed. His anxiety spiked when he saw the Jeep, and Sergeant Duarte behind the wheel.</p>
<p>“Get in,” Duarte ordered him.</p>
<p>Filo sputtered, dreading delay. But Duarte did the right thing, and the owner of the pharmacy jumped out of bed when he realized it was the police banging on his door. He listened to Filo’s description of the pain and offered a bottle of orange liquid free of charge, a courtesy to the sergeant. Back at Filo’s, Duarte himself gave Maia two spoonsful of the medicine, speaking in a calm voice of authority that quickly drained the panic from her.</p>
<p>“It was gas,” he said. “I recognized the signs. My wife, you haven’t met her but you will, Soledad suffered from gas with all three of ours.”</p>
<p>“I feel stupid,” said Maia.</p>
<p>“Nothing to feel stupid about. A mother’s instinct to protect her child is a sacred impulse. It comes from God.”</p>
<p>Maia struggled to connect the image of Duarte she had from Filo with the solicitous man at her bedside. She frowned at Filo; later, she would demand an explanation. But Filo knew what his wife could not see. Duarte’s patience and good humor might be real, but they were real the way a magician’s hat was. There was no hurry, there was all the hurry in the world. The sergeant had not been out driving around Salto in the middle of the night to avoid the sun. Filo had to hand it to him, though. Maia never guessed he was zinging Filo with telepathic darts all the time he was there: urgent, urgent; urgent.</p>
<p>The darkness was beginning to blanch by the time they headed out of town.</p>
<p>“You ready to be a father, Vera?”</p>
<p>“I think so, sir.”</p>
<p>“It never stops. You have to provide, and go on providing, until they lower you into your grave.”</p>
<p>“I know that, sir.”</p>
<p>“You like being a policeman, that’s obvious. Turn left. You’re about to get a chance to enforce the law.”</p>
<p>They were heading north and west, away from the river, toward a settlement where Brazilians had bought up most of the land, crowding out the Paraguayans. Brasiguayos, they called them. They worked real hard. In the ten minutes it took to get there Filo figured out that his chance to enforce the law was going to look a lot like a shakedown. Duarte ordered him to park a hundred and fifty meters out from a two-story brick warehouse under a half-finished tinglado roof. As they sat there, red pooled luxuriously across the east sky and a smell emerged from the earth of something sweet and vegetable, like a secret you’d never guess.</p>
<p>“I want to understand this,” Filo said.</p>
<p>“Fair enough, son. That’s fair enough. See those brick walls? They are sheltering a mountain of cocaine. The cocaine belongs to a man with a spider in his pocket.”</p>
<p>“Meaning he won’t share.”</p>
<p>“His name is Frutos. I’ve given him plenty of chances. He always comes up short.”</p>
<p>“So what do we do?”</p>
<p>“Go in with guns drawn and a sincere attitude. Confiscate the drugs. Arrest the peons. Later, I’ll twist Frutos’ arm and we’ll come to an understanding. Can you handle this, Vera?”</p>
<p>Maybe they were doing it for the wrong reason, but they were about to accomplish a good thing, an important thing. Filo had some sense of the damage all that cocaine could do, up and down the chain. The producers, the dealers, those who thrust the powder up their nose. It was like shit. Anybody who touched it came away rank.</p>
<p>“I can handle it, mi sargento. Don’t worry, I can handle it.”</p>
<p>In the act, it was not much of a challenge. Inside the warehouse they startled three humble men sitting on camp stools eating boiled mandioca sticks and gossiping. Duarte was right about one thing. There was a mountain of cocaine. Frutos, whoever he was, ran an industrial operation. Massive mounds of sacks rose toward the open ceiling on pallets arranged in perfect rows, with just enough space between them for a man with a gun to pass. The sacks were thick, hard black plastic, packed so tightly Filo figured it must be done by machine. The place had the feel of a cathedral built in homage to the Devil.</p>
<p>“Stand up,” Duarte ordered the men. “Hands on your heads. Do something stupid and we’ll ventilate your innards.”</p>
<p>He meant it. They knew he meant it. It was easy. That was all there was to it. But as the men stood there with their hands on their heads like chickens about to be trussed, a fumbling sound came from behind the pallets, and something fell to the dirt floor with a flat thud. A door squeaked.</p>
<p>“Get him,” Duarte told Filo. “I don’t want the son of a bitch getting to Frutos before I do.”</p>
<p>Filo ran between two rows of pallets, holding his rifle close to his body. In the soft dark he stum-bled once but recovered and kept going. He raced out the back door, across a field, and into woods that were the only place a man could hide. Chasing him, Filo was happy. Maybe he hadn’t earned the sense of virtue pumping through him like fresh blood, but there it was. He would have a child. Boy or girl didn’t matter, it would be the child to whom he would someday describe the chase, the red morning, the Devil’s drugs, the dismay on the faces of the three chumps left to guard the evil treasure. What had been a hint was now prophecy. He was meant to be a policeman.</p>
<p>The sky was lightening at its own pace. Ahead of Filo a branch snapped, and he heard a cry of pain. He had to go a couple hundred meters farther before he could make out the figure lying on the ground. There was something wrong about what he saw, but not until he came close did he see what it was. The figure belonged to a woman, and she was sobbing.</p>
<p>“Stand up,” he ordered her.</p>
<p>“I can’t. I fell in a hole. My ankle broke.”</p>
<p>Was it a trick? He didn’t think so. She was old enough to be his mother, from the slumped shape of her, and the gravel in her voice. Her hair was tied back, her elbows were scuffed, her forearms were torn bloody by the prickers she had run through. He did not know what to do.</p>
<p>“What’s your name?”</p>
<p>“Pocha.”</p>
<p>“Where were you running, Pocha?”</p>
<p>She sat up but did not stand up, her ankle truly broken. She had the somber face of a person who expected events to go against her. “I don’t want to go to prison.”</p>
<p>“That’s not up to me.”</p>
<p>His answer made no sense to her. She asked him, “If I am in prison, who will feed the birds?”</p>
<p>It was Filo’s turn not to understand. It took a while, but he got the story out of her. Her boy Alejandro had a mental problem. His brain did not work the way adult brains were supposed to work. He needed looking after, she needed money, and there was no father around. That was why she wound up working in a warehouse full of drugs. It seemed Alejandro had a consuming passion. He fed wild birds. He had cultivated a special place, near a low spot of ground where the creek pooled, to which the birds came in expectation of the corn and grain he put out. That was fine, it kept him out of trouble. However, the boy was afraid of the woods he had to pass through to get to his special place, which meant Pocha had to lead him there by the hand every day.</p>
<p>“Stop crying,” Filo ordered her, and she did.</p>
<p>He marveled at the authority of the uniform.</p>
<p>From the distance he heard Sergeant Duarte calling his name.</p>
<p>“Sí, mi sargento. Everything is under control,” he called back. “I am learning how to be a policeman. I am learning it my way, not your way. I do not care for your way of being a policeman. This woman requires my help.”</p>
<p>Okay, that last part he only thought, he didn’t actually come out and holler. The day might come when he would say it, though. Maybe even holler it.</p>
<p>“Try to stand,” he said to Pocha.</p>
<p>He had to set his rifle down to manage it, but he made a pretty good crutch of his body. It was an embrace of necessity. The woman smelled of sweat and desperation.</p>
<p>“Don’t take me to prison,” she said, too bluntly for it to be a whine. “Take me home.”</p>
<p>“Where do you live?”</p>
<p>She pointed in the direction she had been escaping to when she fell.</p>
<p>Duarte was calling again, more impatiently this time. Filo reassured him that everything was under control. He looked forward to a day when he could come out and say the rest out loud, not just in the privacy of his complicated mind. “This woman is not a criminal. You are the criminal, mi sargento. You’re the bad guy in this movie. I am fulfilling my duty to protect her from men like you.”</p>
<p>He would have to come back for his rifle. “How far?” he said to Pocha.</p>
<p>“Not far at all.”</p>
<p>They went slowly through the woods, Pocha hobbling, Filo stiff as the crutch he had to be. For better or worse, his conviction did not fade as they went, it only deepened. He was meant to be a policeman, just not the kind of policeman the sergeant had become. As white morning light engulfed and transformed the woods into a place they could negotiate, he felt the day’s heat rising up to claim him. In a while, odds were, he would wear it like skin.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trevor Weersta dragged a dead calf across one of his father’s empty fields. He pulled it carefully by the legs, each hand wrapped tightly around the ankle. When Trevor came to the burial ditch at the side of the field, he rolled the calf into the open ground and pitched dirt over the body with a heavy, rusted shovel. When he was finished, Trevor walked back to the barn where he saw his father looking up at the sky, at the sun falling down behind the dry and empty land, and at the frail bodies of the cattle that were roaming closer to the fence. His father was hoping for rain. Trevor saw him drop his head, dig his boot into the earth and watch the dirt rise up, the dust settle on top of the dark leather.</p>
<p>There was no more hay to go around, only one half-empty sack of feed and very little water for the cattle that were limping around the pasture with their pink lips hanging open. The livestock that had once grazed over the pasture in bunches was now dwindled to a handful of thin animals. Trevor watched the cattle, tripping over their own legs, some falling down on their bony knees.</p>
<p>“What are they doing?” Trevor asked as his father walked up by the wire fence and stood with one hand on a slanted post, looking at the cattle on the other side. They were huddled together and shivering, a strange thing to do in the humid Missouri summer. Some of the cattle were lining themselves against the rusted barbs, others struggling to even stand.</p>
<p>“I doubt too many people have seen cattle act like this before,” his father said, spitting at the ground. The cows stepped closer, offering low breathless moans. It reminded Trevor of a sound he’d heard years before, his mother lying in the room next to his, his father on a knee at her bedside, running a wet cloth over her forehead throughout the night.</p>
<p>“Why do they moan?” Trevor asked, walking up near his father’s heels.</p>
<p>“Folks in town will say that animals have no sense, no brains, nothing. But these cows aren’t dumb.” Trevor watched his father’s eyes move from one cow to the next. “They know where they get their feed from. They aren’t dumb to who I am.”</p>
<p>His father stood face-to-face with a steer.</p>
<p>“Can’t we save these last few?” Trevor asked.</p>
<p>Trevor’s father placed one hand over the other on a post and squatted behind the thick piece of wood.</p>
<p>“I may have held out hope for too long,” his father said. His brief laugh afterward caught Trevor off guard. “If there is such a thing as hoping for too long.” His father pointed. “Look at the ribs on this one.” He reached between the barbs and brushed the back of his hand over the side of the steer in front of him. “His shoulder blades are rounded now, and he shakes at the knees when he walks. They all do, if you watch them closely.”</p>
<p>“He could be good again for meat. We can borrow more bales from Mr. Penserum,” Trevor said.</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t start fooling yourself.” The steer his father had been touching let out a guttural moan. His father stood. A few of the others pushed their bodies against the fence and pierced themselves. The animals clenched their jaws, their heads tilting up and back each time they drove into a vine of barbs. Thin trails of blood trickled down their sides, striping their brown and black coats in red. Trevor stepped back.</p>
<p>“What are they doing?” Trevor asked, looking at the shadow of his father in front of him.</p>
<p>“They’re starving. Just dying as creatures do.” Trevor’s father put his hand out as if he were going to grab hold of Trevor’s shoulder, then he returned his hand to his side where it seemed to shake. “It might be barely, only by a little, but they see something similar in us. Look in his eyes, that brown one there. Can you see reason in the eyes?”</p>
<p>Trevor had looked into the eyes of many beasts: pigs ramming into one another in the pen, chickens clucking wildly in their cages, groggy mules he used to pull along by a thick rope. These animals weren’t able to last through the three years of drought. As Trevor looked around his father and into the black eyes of the steer, he could see nothing beyond the black.</p>
<p>“I can’t see it,” Trevor said. He watched his father’s face, the jaw slightly open, creases in his cheeks deep with dirt. His father looked as if he were deciphering bad news, the same expression Trevor had seen a few years ago when he was awoken in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Trevor had stood with a hand grasping the door frame of the hallway entrance beside the kitchen table, listening to the town priest and doctor whispering to his father on the porch. Trevor brought himself lower to the ground so as not to be seen, his hand sliding down the door frame, his body crouched. His father never spoke, only nodded, stared, tight-fisted, discerning. This was what Trevor saw now in his father’s face, until his father, without another word, walked away toward the shed, leaving Trevor alone, the cows praying to his father through their mouths.</p>
<p>Trevor’s father pulled out a glass jug and poured the contents into a tin cup—buttermilk. They had just finished eating rabbit stew, something they cooked often because the meat was easy to come by. Trevor’s father had to sell their only gun a year earlier and borrowed Elias Penserum’s shotgun for hunting smaller abundant animals, the ones who could manage the drought.</p>
<p>Trevor looked at the yolky milk in front of him, always dreading this part of the afternoon meal. He wished the thick liquid would vanish. His father stood and scooted the cup closer to Trevor. The liquid undulated to the rim and back down.</p>
<p>“It tastes so awful,” Trevor said.</p>
<p>“It puts a lining in your stomach. It protects you,” his father said, sitting across from him again. “Your great-uncle Art always said it was good for a man. I trust that.”</p>
<p>Trevor ran his fingers over the table, tapping them as his father spoke. He studied the drink once more, then breathed hard and took the cup from the table, pouring the buttermilk down. Trevor wiped his lips with the back of his hand and looked up at his father who was staring out toward the porch, one strap of his overalls undone and hanging at his waist. Trevor admired the rough cut of his father’s unshaven face, his steady callused hand fishing around in a loose pocket under the table.</p>
<p>“If you need to fill the tank,” his father said, handing over a quarter. He ran his hand through his pocket again and pulled out the key to their truck. “Be home before it gets too late. We have equipment that still needs put away. Tonight better than tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Trevor nodded, eyeing the key.</p>
<p>“Mind the roads. Be careful in that big city.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“And put the truck back facing east how I like it.”</p>
<p>After the meal, Trevor drove away from Alanthus Grove toward Pine Creek, a small nearby town. He thought of the farm, almost bare, and the cattle being whittled down so fast. He wondered if anybody, anything would survive.</p>
<p>Trevor came upon the Penserum acreage a few miles down the road. He saw Elias Penserum standing over an old oil barrel in the yard, working splinters of wood and old newspaper inside the barrel in a half-hearted manner. Elias looked up at the truck and tipped his hat. His crops had almost made headway the year before, but a batch of cutworms crawled through his fields, gnawing the roots and tips until there was nothing left. Trevor waved his hand over the hood and pressed the pedal harder. The wind picked up in the cab, and the dust rolled behind him in a solitary cloud. He turned back to look at Elias one more time, watching him slap a mosquito on his skin, brush it off, then put his arms deep into the corroded barrel.</p>
<p>Trevor turned off the narrow dirt road and into town. He was going to pick up James and Danny Blackwell, two brothers he had met while repairing the porch for their father, who was the manager of the bank. Mr. Blackwell was always dressed in full, dark suits. On the day they fixed the porch, James, the older brother, spent the entire afternoon standing over Trevor and his father, watching them as they cut boards and fit them into place.</p>
<p>“Hey, Weersta, what do you think about seeing some fights?” James whispered when Trevor’s father had stepped up into the bed of the truck, getting boards and spare nails.</p>
<p>“How do you mean?” Trevor asked, holding a hammer in his hand.</p>
<p>“I mean you come and pick up me and Danny next Friday afternoon, and we all go to Charles City.”</p>
<p>Trevor looked over his shoulder. James was a dark figure in front of the sunlight, and Trevor couldn’t see around him to his father, but he could hear his father’s grunts and the lumber being dragged off the truck. “Why would I do that?” Trevor asked.</p>
<p>“For the fights, you dummy.”</p>
<p>“What do I want to watch that for?”</p>
<p>“You just sit around that farm of yours with your old man, am I right?”</p>
<p>“Mostly.”</p>
<p>“And you don’t get out, do you?”</p>
<p>“I suppose not,” Trevor said, turning the hammer over.</p>
<p>“Well, here’s your chance. You can get me and Danny outside of Neddelson’s. We’ll be waiting on the east side of the building.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you get your father to take you?” Trevor asked. He could still hear his own father working somewhere behind James, dropping nails onto the metal surface of the truck bed. James looked over his shoulder and all around the yard.</p>
<p>“Do you think he’d let me go to something like that? Hell no. He’d whoop me with a splintery picket if he knew I went there. He’d whoop me with one in each hand if he knew I was going with someone like you. Look, you’re doing me a favor and I’m doing you one.”</p>
<p>Trevor nodded. He didn’t know why he agreed, maybe something about the idea of an adventure away from the farm. As he watched James walk away, Trevor’s father came over carrying a load of boards. His forearms split at the muscle, creating little ridges up and down the arm, making Trevor wonder what a beating from the hands of his own father would feel like.</p>
<p>Trevor pulled up to Neddelson&#8217;s ice cream parlor, spotting James and Danny sitting against the brick wall, Danny scrambling jacks along the ground to begin a new game. Trevor hit the horn, and Danny scooped the jacks and ball into an empty sugar sack, and the two of them came running, glancing over their shoulders with each stride.</p>
<p>“Bet you haven’t ever seen anything like these fights,” James said into the open window of the cab. He slapped his hand on the door. James and Danny got into the truck, Danny scooting his body into the middle, giving James the window seat. James pulled shut the door, and the glove box fell open at his knees. “Nice heap you got here,” he said with a laugh.</p>
<p>The navy paint had chipped off the sides, and the tailgate was kept in place with chicken wire. The driver’s side door could only be opened from the inside, using an aggressive push with the shoulder, and the cap for the gas tank had been lost visiting family in Nebraska the year before the drought set in, the year before Trevor’s mother fell ill. Trevor couldn’t remember much of it, but he could sometimes conjure up that feeling in his stomach, the tingling he felt behind his ears when his mother, on long rides like that, would put his head on her shoulder and run just one finger in swirls through his hair.</p>
<p>Trevor drove slow and steady. He was uneasy and kept feeling an itch at his neck.</p>
<p>“I thought you country boys were wild,” James said. “Let’s see you push this thing.” But Trevor only clung tighter to the wheel. He looked over at Danny sitting between them, shaking the sugar sack, watching the jacks tumble inside.</p>
<p>Danny looked up and said, “How many fights do you think they have tonight?”</p>
<p>“Probably three or four,” James said. “I can’t wait to see somebody get pounded.” When nobody responded, James elbowed Danny in the ribs. “What are you—a sissy?” James turned to Trevor. “Don’t you want to see some blood?”</p>
<p>It took Trevor a moment to realize James was referring to human blood. “Sure,” Trevor said.</p>
<p>“You must be one useless hand out on that ranch,” James said, balling his hand into a fist and releasing it.</p>
<p>Trevor wiped at his brow, trying to ignore the words. James’s collar was open, and Trevor noticed bruises on his upper chest and collarbone, the color of healthy grapes, outlined in black. When James saw him staring, Trevor looked out the window as if he’d caught sight of a rabbit scampering along the road.</p>
<p>“Kind of guy that’s out there daydreaming and guiding saddle-reins, and when the horses come around, whammo, he gets trampled right under,” James said and laughed.</p>
<p>“He looks okay to me,” Danny spoke up, his head tilted toward Trevor.</p>
<p>“I wasn&#8217;t talking to you,” James said.</p>
<p>They were approaching Charles City and buzzards circled overhead. Trevor watched them dip down and snatch at pieces of a deer carcass, but he only looked for a moment, then turned away as they passed. Trevor wanted to stop, to get out of the truck and walk through open space and thick air.</p>
<p>Trevor jammed on the brakes.</p>
<p>“Jesus,” James said.</p>
<p>Trevor let up on the brake and pulled the truck over on Locust Street. It was the main road, and it ran right down the middle of Charles City, alive with people and automobiles.<br />
“Don’t park here. Drive us farther in,” James said. Danny was quiet, and James thumped him on the chest.</p>
<p>“Yeah, farther in.” Danny said.</p>
<p>Trevor put all his weight into the door, and it was stiff in swinging open, calling out with a screech. Trevor left the door open and turned to the brothers. “We’re walking from here,” he said.</p>
<p>“You’re loony,” James said. He pushed Danny across the truck’s bench, until Danny almost fell out. Then James followed and slammed the door.</p>
<p>Trevor walked down the paved road on Locust, not bothering to see if the boys were behind him. He looked instead at the awnings overhead as he passed the local shops. They were dyed in vibrant colors he rarely saw: emerald, magenta, fuchsia, soft reds and yellows. Shop signs had names he’d never heard of before: Swift &amp; Taylor’s Baked Goods, The Stitchery, The Charles Ray Saloon, Pike’s Grocery.</p>
<p>“It’s going to really be something. I saw women fight there once,” James said from behind.</p>
<p>“You did not,” Danny said.</p>
<p>“Like you would know the difference,” James said. “Weersta, what are you doing up there?”</p>
<p>Trevor had stopped under the emerald awning above Hebert’s Fine Metals and was watching a woman across the street, who wore a billowy, powder-blue dress with frills at the cuffs. </p>
<p>She carried an umbrella that was light brown at the stem, and the hook at the bottom, which she covered with her small hand, was made of solid bronze and blinked in the light.<br />
“Weersta,” James said.</p>
<p>Trevor watched the woman’s three little children and imagined them as brothers and sisters he never had the chance to have. As people came down the street, the children weaved through them like thread, giggling all the while with chocolate and candies in their hands. The people walking by smiled and sometimes tried to pat one of the children on the head.</p>
<p>James punched Trevor in the shoulder. “Knock it off. Didn’t your father teach you not to stare like that?”</p>
<p>“It’s un-polite,” Danny said, walking up behind James.</p>
<p>“Impolite,” James corrected. “Christ.” He looked at Trevor. “So, what’s the big deal here?”</p>
<p>Trevor didn’t look at James, but focused instead on the procession of sharp, dark automobiles that sputtered down the road. Several of them beeped their horns, and passengers waved from the windows with fine gloves on their hands.</p>
<p>“What are you, afraid of those big old cars? Can handle a steer and a mule, but you’re scared of a box on wheels? Shoot, Danny and me have been here a hundred times. A thousand. </p>
<p>It’s a bore. This city’s always been a bore and it always will be.”</p>
<p>“I kind of like it here,” Danny said. “They have a fair in the spring with a Ferris wheel that touches the clouds almost.”</p>
<p>“It’s boring,” James said. “Ferris wheels are for prissies.” With that, James walked up the street.</p>
<p>“We better follow him,” Danny said. “I don’t know how to get to the fights.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” Trevor said, but he didn’t want to leave. He followed behind Danny, but kept losing him by a pace. Trevor couldn’t stop looking into the shop windows, and he ran his knuckles across the smooth, painted letters on the glass. He watched the people inside weigh bread loafs in one hand and then the other, spread fingers over ceramic cups and saucers, children dip into wooden candy barrels and come out with a hill of sweets, the kinds of things that could really last. Trevor wondered if he would ever know that feeling again, maybe not happiness, but contentment with the world he lived in with his father.</p>
<p>“Catch up, Weersta,” James said. Trevor looked ahead and saw James and Danny waiting for him at the end of the street, James pointing down a side road.<br />
When Trevor reached the brothers, they were talking about the fights. “It won’t be too hard to watch, will it?” Danny asked.</p>
<p>“Don’t be such a wimp,” James said. Danny turned from James, crossing his arms in front of his chest. James put out a hand and squeezed Danny’s shoulder. “Jeez, you’ll be fine. You’ll love it, I swear.” Danny smiled a little, but closed it up fast as if he didn’t want to show it. “Let’s move,” James said, and he headed down the road.</p>
<p>Trevor could only think of Locust Street. He wondered where all the denim overalls were, the soft straw hats, the cracked and dirty boots and matching hands. He wondered if his father ever thought of selling the farm, or abandoning it and coming to the city, some place like Charles where the going seemed good, and where the people talked to each other and smiled and took the time to call each other by their names. There were people here, lively people, and more than just two, more than just him and his father and a dwindling herd of cattle on a patch of decaying land.</p>
<p>“So, what happens at these fights?” Trevor asked James, not wanting to think of the farm anymore.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen women fight here. Sometimes these old coots fight cocks and hounds too. But people fighting is what makes it interesting. They don&#8217;t even give them gloves or anything, just knuckle to jaw the whole time.”</p>
<p>“There isn’t much blood, is there?” Danny asked, closing his eyes when he said the word blood.</p>
<p>“What do you expect?”</p>
<p>“I hope not much blood,” Danny said.</p>
<p>They had moved beyond the street and into open land. The only thing in the distance was a giant warehouse, where a line of men spilled from the big open doors. Trevor and Danny followed behind James as he walked across the patchy grass and over to the line of men. Trevor looked at the warehouse entrance, tall and wide, and noticed the paint along the outside had faded, like the clothes of the men who stood there in front of him. The cloth at their knees and shoulders was worn and poor, almost hanging on by mere stitches, and their straw hats bore a scattering of small tears. Trevor was surprised at how relieved he was to see these farmers, to look at their dirty work shirts and stained hands. He noticed James and Danny watching the men with anxious faces, staring at the sweat as it rolled down the backs of the farmers’ brown necks, causing dark stains in their shirts. These men put Trevor at ease, knowing some of them had traveled as far as he had, from the same dirt roads and cracked fields.</p>
<p>For a moment, behind one of the men and through the big open doors, Trevor caught a glimpse of the face of a woman in the darkened warehouse. She looked like his mother. Trevor put his hand above his brow to block the sun, and just as he stepped forward to see if it was really her, alive again in the shadows, two men crossed in front of him, shoving one another to pick up a nickel that had fallen in the dirt. It caused such a commotion that other men jumped on the pile, and Trevor couldn’t see anything but body after body fighting for a coin.</p>
<p>Seeing that face, the semblance of his mother, reminded him of what life had been like when she was around, of how it felt to live on a flourishing farm. He tried hard to squash these thoughts when they came, but the memories were so vivid and he couldn’t help himself. Just then he could see the leaning stalks at midday and hear the squeal of head-butting pigs, fighting for position at the trough. His father was there, too, dumping seed over the fence as the wind blew and shavings floated up in the air. And Trevor could see his father pause for a moment, amid the whirlwind of horses neighing and feed falling and the dinner bell ringing and a child playing in the dirt, to look up to the shed where his wife stood, waving down to him.</p>
<p>“Five cents a-piece,” the man said when the boys approached. He was guarding the door with his boulder-chest, his fat chin dangling over the small bit of light coming from inside. It was growing dark behind them, and the brothers very casually dropped coins down the hole, the bucket thanking them with a ching. Trevor pulled out the quarter his father had given him for gas and traded it for nickels. A rush of guilt seized his hand as he held one of the nickels over the can, watching it fall into the bucket.<br />
Trevor stepped inside and looked around. The place was stocked full of boxes and pallets. A few mops and brooms leaned against the opposite wall. Many of the pallets had been pushed aside to form a makeshift fighting ring in the center. Four lamps were stuck on poles, designating the four corners.</p>
<p>There were a few women in the crowd, but Trevor couldn’t spot the one he’d seen before. He wondered why women would show up to such an event, scarves pulled tight around their heads. Trevor noticed a man holding his son up on his shoulders. The man’s pants and shirt were clean, and the clasps of his suspenders shone golden off the light from the lamps. He rocked his son back and forth as the small boy grabbed the man’s hair in fistfuls as if attempting to guide the reins of a runaway horse. There was something wrong in their interaction, something missing as the man tried time and again to explain to the fearful little boy why they were there. “It’s for the fighting,” he kept saying. “Don’t you want to see the fighting?”</p>
<p>Trevor took a seat next to James and Danny atop the stacks of boxes, their legs swinging over the side, heels brushing the wood. Trevor sensed something familiar about the inside of the warehouse, the way the beams along the ceiling were aligned and chipped like the barn back home. The swallows had even nested in the same places—two nests to each corner beam—and the air inside smelled of sweat and whipped hay particles.</p>
<p>James put his fists up, punching lefts and rights into the air. He pushed at Danny to play along. Danny shook his head and pulled back.</p>
<p>“Such a dump,” James said, still weaving left and right like a prize fighter.</p>
<p>“It’s not so bad,” Trevor said.</p>
<p>James turned his punching game toward Trevor and took a real shot at his arm. “No reflexes,” James said.</p>
<p>“Knock it off,” Trevor said, rubbing the burning in his shoulder.</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t blow your top,” James taunted, but put his hands down and adjusted his position on the box.</p>
<p>Trevor looked over at a commotion of men in the crowd exchanging coins and paper money with a loud man collecting bets in his fists. Another man walked from behind a curtain drawn between box pallets on the far side. The first two fighters followed him. The fighter in the gray had a sharp unshaven jaw. His cotton shirt was torn as if slashed with a knife and he was wearing faded blue jeans. He walked out with confidence, alone, without expression or emotion. Trevor thought he recognized the man and tried to figure out where he had seen him before. He had the look of a field hand, muscular and full of veins, but Trevor was sure he had never seen him on any ranch. The other fighter had a pale face with a skinny dark mustache and wore no shirt. He had on dark shorts that came to his mid-thigh and showed his pale, bony legs. He was followed by what looked to be a manager, a gentleman with a nice watch, a suit and fedora. They spoke to one another in German. Trevor recognized the language because Elias Penserum used to hire extra field hands when the crop was good, and many times these men were burly Germans who didn&#8217;t speak a word of English.</p>
<p>Trevor lifted one leg up, tucked it into his chest and rested his chin on his knee, looking over both fighters. The two men were gloveless, just as James had said, baring their knuckles to entertain. The man who had walked the fighters into the ringed area raised his arms, signaling the start of the fight. The crowd of men clapped and stomped violently. The wood vibrated beneath the boys.</p>
<p>The German fighter kept his arms loose at his sides, his bare fists clenched at his hips, his feet moving quickly beneath him. The fighter in the gray kept his left arm stretched down like he was measuring something and lifted his other just under his chin. They danced in their dark leather boots, the German with a polished shine, and the fighter in the gray with muddy scuffs.</p>
<p>The fighters took time in sizing each other, in closing distances and retreating. When one moved to the left, the other moved around to the right, neither making a move to strike and each step countering the other as if balancing the unseen ring. Minutes passed, and the crowd started to hiss at the hopeless fighters, and then the German took a step forward and threw a fast right hand, missing the fighter in the gray. The crowd gasped and awed.</p>
<p>Heat seemed to be rising in the old warehouse. Trevor undid a few buttons on his shirt and looked around to see if he could spot the woman somewhere in the fog of fist-pumping men. He didn&#8217;t see her. He wondered whether or not there truly was a woman who looked so much like his mother or if it was only a silhouette and he had filled the face in himself.</p>
<p>The German drew back, bending his head to the right and left, touching each ear to a shoulder, over and over. The fighter in the gray stayed on his toes, balancing. When the German lunged forward with another straight right hand, the fighter in the gray side-stepped, tucked his chin to his chest, and blocked the forthcoming punch with his right arm pressed against his skull. Trevor noticed James cheering, waving his arms above his head.</p>
<p>But the fighter in the gray had absorbed the shock of the blow and threw an immediate left-hook, landing flush with the German fighter’s eye socket. He then took a stride forward and landed a stiff right to his opponent’s jaw. The German’s head snapped back like a tree branch and the crowd roared again. A small ache grew inside of Trevor as the German tried to step forward and regain his balance. He threw a few jabs to gain distance, but failed as the fighter in the gray dodged each, weaving, and swung a heavy right-hook that landed on the other cheek and split the German’s flesh open under the eye. Blood sprayed across the floor like a tear in a hose line, and Danny put his hands over his face. Trevor noticed James flinch and turn his head for a second, and then look around to make sure Trevor and Danny hadn’t seen him. Trevor set his eyes forward when James looked at him, as if he had seen nothing.</p>
<p>With each strike of the fist, the ache inside Trevor grew.</p>
<p>“Is it done, is it over?” Danny asked above the noise of the crowd.</p>
<p>The fighter in the gray stepped forward once more as the German stumbled back, putting his hand to his face, feeling for the open wound. The German hunched over for a second, and the fighter in the gray threw an uppercut under the German&#8217;s down-turned chin, knocking a tooth from the fighter&#8217;s mouth and sending him to the dirt floor. The crowd went up again as the fight came to an end. The German was out on the ground, his arms stiff at his sides, his legs shaking involuntarily. A few men ran up and patted the fighter in the gray on the back, but the fighter in the gray did not acknowledge them or what they were cheering for. He kept his head low and his chin tucked, something desperate to his face as he walked behind the curtain.</p>
<p>Trevor looked over at Danny still curled up and using his hands to block his sight.</p>
<p>“You can take your hands away,” Trevor said, “It’s okay to look now.”</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t worry about him,” James said. “He&#8217;s afraid of everything.”</p>
<p>Trevor stared at the curtain as if he could see through the purple cloth to where the fighter in the gray was walking, fingers tipped with blood, head low and out of sight. Trevor jumped down from the box and pushed through the crowd. He didn’t know where he was going, but he knew he needed to get out of there. He could hear James yelling from afar as he left, could hear his bully chants until he walked into the cool, open air and kept moving, feeling the beat of his boots on the patchy grass.</p>
<p>Trevor found it somehow louder now on Locust Street. The evening was coming on, and the streets were filled with more people, mostly men in suit jackets and fedoras. The women were generally gone, and there were no children running around to weave between the people. Trevor was almost run into by a man with a thin mustache who carried a newspaper under each arm. The man turned his head and swore at Trevor as he passed by. Trevor didn’t know what it was that he did besides just being there, walking along the street at night.<br />
Trevor decided to stay close to the storefronts after that, avoiding anyone who moved along the street.</p>
<p>He heard a loud whack and stopped to look through a shop window. He was so close to the glass that he wasn’t able to read the large, colorful print, but saw a very thin man inside with an apron smeared light pink. The man was making precise, hard chops at a thick cut of beef on the table in front of him. It was beef, Trevor knew, because of the way each rib bone was spaced by a quarter-inch, the length of the bones, how they curved more at the top. Trevor had never watched a man butcher a cow before as he and his father only raised the cattle and sent them to the slaughterhouse when the time was right.</p>
<p>Trevor watched the butcher, knowing he should look away, but couldn’t get himself to do it. The butcher chopped, then rotated the slab and came down again with the thick knife. With each swing, Trevor saw the patch-colored faces of the cattle at home, their pink tongues dangling, their rocky knees.</p>
<p>A glass shattered in the distance. It spooked Trevor to the point of jumping away from the butcher shop window. He looked down the street toward the sound and realized it came from the direction where the truck was parked. Trevor heard a piano playing up ahead. The music was coming from the Charles Ray Saloon, and Trevor walked that way, a little nervous about it, but he was itching to get back to the truck. Men were outside the bar with glasses of beer and tumblers of whiskey, and they stood holding their drinks at their stomachs. Trevor saw a barman on his hands and knees, sweeping the broken pieces of glass into a pile. One man put his maroon fedora on a thimble-nosed woman and took it right back off when she reached for the top of her head to adjust it.</p>
<p>“Well, a young boy,” one of the men shouted as Trevor drew closer to the bar.</p>
<p>All of the faces outside turned to Trevor. They seemed like mean faces to him, men with dark moustaches that covered so much of their face their mouths couldn’t be seen. Their eyes couldn’t be seen either under their pulled-down fedoras. Trevor’s father had always said you could know a man from the first meeting if you could get a good look into his eyes.</p>
<p>“Come on over, boy,” another man said. Trevor put his hands into his pockets and crossed the street to the other side. As he crossed, the crowd outside the bar hurled swears and boos in his direction, but Trevor kept on toward the truck, hoping his back would be a strong enough wall to keep the people away.</p>
<p>Even a few hundred paces away, Trevor could still hear the laughter of the men outside the bar. It was too loud and rude and overwhelming for him, all of it spilling out of the bar and into the street.</p>
<p>Trevor was relieved when he got back to the truck. He felt optimistic about the city in the day, but believed it had turned on him with the night, had put fear into his chest that rumbled down to his stomach. He sat on the truck bench and considered putting the keys in the ignition and driving away without James and Danny. He thought about it, but only briefly, because he knew his father wouldn’t back out on a promise, a deal, and though he was ready to leave, he couldn’t make himself go.</p>
<p>Trevor got out of the truck and pushed a thumb into the side of a tire and checked the pressure. He knew he needed to get home, and it was already darker than his father would have wanted. Trevor thought of his duty to his father, of the fact that though he sometimes wished to be anything but, he had been brought up a farmer and would die that way. He walked to the back of the truck and unwound the chicken wire at the hatch and wound it back tighter. He looked at his father’s kerchief that served in place of the gas cap, ran his hands over the kerchief and smelled the tips of his fingers. Something about the smell of gasoline fumes, the lost cap years ago, made him think of his mother, but he turned away, as if from the thought, and walked to the driver’s side of the truck where he sat down in the road, leaning up against the front tire well for support. He tried to draw a bicep in the dirt with his finger and make the muscle bend and break apart like the fighter’s did, but the lines were too thick for detail. Trevor brushed over his attempt and picked up loose pebbles instead and shot them across the road with his thumb.</p>
<p>In the distance down Locust, he heard the rants and calls of James and Danny. He saw the brothers skipping up the road, throwing punches through the air. Behind them, Trevor could hear faint laughter and yelling and the sounds of the people of Charles City having one too many drinks at the Charles Ray Saloon. And just behind all of that, beyond the music and the people and these two brothers coming at him so fast, their voices louder and their movements bigger as they drew closer, he could see his father at home, wringing his hands together, mumbling things to himself about rain and cattle and rooftops, and waiting patiently for his son to return home.</p>
<p>As Trevor drove back toward Alanthus Grove, the brothers went on and on about the fights. They talked about a fighter who had a wooden leg, about a spectator from the city who jumped into the ring and started beating a fighter with a cane because the loss cost the man a lot of money. James talked about blood and broken bones and swollen eyes. Trevor nodded all the while, but the stories didn’t interest him. He kept thinking of the fighter, trying to place him somewhere in his memory.</p>
<p>The engine started to click as if a small stone were rattling around inside. Trevor’s father had told him it was nothing to worry about, just one of the odd quirks that came with the truck’s personality.</p>
<p>“What is that?” James asked.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing,” Trevor said.</p>
<p>“Sounds like you have a broken-down engine.”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing.”</p>
<p>“Too bad you can&#8217;t afford a new truck. Pops said your stalks have been dead for years, and your cattle aren’t far behind. Your old man probably doesn’t know how to prepare the ground right. I set and tilled my mother’s garden in one afternoon a few years ago, and she said she’d never seen such rich vegetables in her whole life. He probably just doesn’t have the touch.”</p>
<p>Trevor lowered his head and gripped the steering wheel with his left hand. They were a few miles from the turn where he would drop the brothers off in town. He looked over at<br />
James sitting next to Danny, his arm hanging out the window.</p>
<p>“You hear me?”</p>
<p>Trevor placed his hand over the stick shift, squeezed hard, pumped the clutch and pushed the gas, changing into higher gear, shuffling back and forth as he increased the speed.<br />
He thought of James’s hand coming at him, up and over in a fist. The gears shifted. The wind was the only thing hitting him in the face.</p>
<p>“What the heck are you doing?”</p>
<p>Trevor breathed the cold night air, moved his head from side to side, avoiding James, avoiding everything that was coming at him. He came to a familiar turn in the road and knew the stretch exactly. He shut off the headlights, confident he could maneuver in the dark, and pushed the engine harder, racing past the fence posts.</p>
<p>“Jesus, are you crazy?”</p>
<p>Trevor punched the shift forward one more time, flying along the road as he pushed on the clutch and over to the gas: left, then right, left, then right. He could see very little in front of him and nothing behind him.</p>
<p>James reached for the wheel, and Trevor stomped both feet onto the brake pedal, sending the truck skittering along the gravel at an angle, almost flipping the vehicle. James and Danny were thrown against the passenger door, and Trevor braced himself, pushing hard on the steering wheel and using the strength in his legs to hold himself against the seat bench. They were a mile from the drop-off, but when the truck was finally at a standstill, the dust rising up all around, James threw the door open, pulling Danny along by the wrist, cursing Trevor and all farmers as the brothers ran off the gravel road and onto dry pasture land.</p>
<p>The rest of the drive was quiet. Trevor passed Elias Penserum’s land, but nobody seemed home, and the corroded barrel stood alone in the dark yard. When he got to his father’s property, he took his time rolling down the road, looking at the wooden posts as he passed them. He followed the barbed wire that traced the borders of the farm. Trevor tried to imagine it as it used to be: golden and swaying, the three square fields next to one another like the start of a natural quilt. As a small child, he used to wander beneath the stalks, dreaming of when he would be tall enough to reach the top husk. Now Trevor noticed a place where the fence needed mending, something his father mentioned but hadn’t gotten around to fixing. Trevor drove past the worn place, and then stopped the truck and got out.</p>
<p>The moon was high and bright up above, almost entirely full except for a small sliver, blocked on its edge by an unseen cloud. Trevor walked until his feet hit the hard earth on the edge of the field. He went back to where the fence needed mending and stopped. Trevor set his hand on a fence post as he had seen his father do on so many occasions, only this post was bent far out of its placement hole like something had knocked it real hard. He thought of what his father would be doing the next morning, ramming one of his bad shoulders into the post so it would stand up again, holding together its part of the fence.</p>
<p>As he continued along the bank of the road, Trevor saw about ten feet of barbs and cable hanging down, twisted around the straight pieces of wire. Trevor set his hand out to touch the wires, untangle a few so his father would have less work in the morning. He collected a little bit of the cable in his hands, careful not to cut himself, and was reminded of the bloody fingers of the fighter. He could see the fighter with a shovel in his hands, going around the dry land and digging holes in indiscriminate parts of the fields. Trevor saw him for the first time in a panic, his forearms splitting and un-splitting with each strike of the shovel, the tips of his bruised and bleeding knuckles, spending the energy of an entire day moving from one field to another, one patch to the next, scooping up dirt and creating holes, filling them back in when they didn’t reveal anything. What are you doing that for? The fighter looked up with sweat dripping from his straw hat, one strap of his overalls undone and hanging at his side. “There has to be water down here. It’s there, I know it. If I ever knew anything, I know it’s down there.”</p>
<p>Trevor drove the truck up near the house and pulled it in backward, the square nose facing east as his father had asked. He left the windows down so the night air would float in.<br />
He walked along the side of the house and over to his father’s tool shed. He thought of walking into the house, but the fighter was still on his mind. Trevor brushed his hand along the side of the shed, thinking it was late enough, and his father would be in the house having coffee at the kitchen table, pretending to read the paper.</p>
<p>Down the hill, Trevor heard a low moan. He followed the sound a little ways then stopped and retreated to the shadow of the shed. Under the blink of the stars, he saw his father standing at the barn, Elias Penserum’s double-barrel shotgun leaning up against the outside wall. Trevor watched his father as he dragged a small metal trough across the ground, and he felt guilty for leaving his father. His old legs trembled, and Trevor could see a curve to his father’s back as he grunted and knelt down to lift the trough. His father shook as he pulled the trough into his stomach, brought it up to his beltline and carried it into the barn.</p>
<p>His father breathed in deep as he closed the heavy doors, one at a time. A late-night fog was forming around the barn and the lower fields like a curtain, and his father took his hat off as if he had just realized it was dark and there was no reason to have it on anymore. He set it on a post along the gate and arched his back, his chest pushed toward the moon. His father went to the side of the barn, picked up the last grain bag and began dumping it over the fence, little kernels tumbling to the ground like golden teeth. He then made a clicking sound with his tongue, incorporating a soft whistle. Out of the darkness and the fog, the cows staggered over to the fence, some flopping down on all fours to eat.</p>
<p>Trevor’s father took off a leather glove and reached through the fence, walking down the line, his arm carefully set between the strands of barbs, running his bare hand over any steer within reach. Then his father walked to the barn and stood near the shotgun. There was a small open box on the ground at his feet, and he bent down, pulling two shotgun shells from the box and rolling them in his hand. Trevor watched closely, trying to feel the ache of his father’s muscles, the age of his bones, all that was his father. Trevor found himself moving forward, just reaching the front of the shed when he hit a patch of uneven dirt. His step faltered, and he kicked loose gravel against the wall, sending an echo down to his father, who looked up, startled, and closed his hand over the shells.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today is the one-year anniversary of the Conway High Massacre, as it has come to be called, and we—the nineteen surviving gunshot victims—have converged on the large desolate field where Travis Covington, 17, filmed his now-infamous video diary before opening fire on a pep rally in the Conway High School gymnasium, killing twenty-six. It is midnight, and the crisp night air is rich with the aromas of earth and grass and decay. Our feet send up a chorus of inelegant squishing sounds as we proceed into the mud, sidestepping pieces of junk deposited by neighborhood residents unwilling to make the trek to the dump across town: broken appliances, tattered furniture, mounds of old mildewed clothes. A graveyard of possibilities. With our eyes fixed on the ground in search of rusty metal scraps, we might appear to any onlookers like a search party combing the area for a missing person.</p>
<p>What we are looking for, however, is the baseball diamond-sized pond on the far side of the field where Travis used to practice shooting at beer bottles, setting them to float in the center by way of a small platform constructed from plastic containers. In the video, which he Fed-exed to WKLL News an hour before the attack, the viewer can see the bottles pop and shatter in mists of brown glass. In the wake of the attack, the footage went viral, attracting scads of gawkers to the site, eventually forcing police to cordon off the area until the traffic stopped altogether. Up until now we have avoided the field, partially for this reason, but mostly out of a childish fear that our presence might be met with the ghostly vengeance reserved for movie characters who have stumbled upon ancient Indian burial grounds.</p>
<p>Classes will end at one o’clock today for what promises to be a sobering commemorative assembly in the front of the school. The mayor will speak, and then a few words from student council president Jessica Schiff, and then principal Moody will call for twenty-six seconds of silence. We will be seated in a row of folding chairs at the front, dressed in our honorary CHS letter jackets, of course, hands folded in our laps like penitents, exuding the heroic poise that has come to be expected of us. Actually, it’s not so hard to understand why our classmates would like our scars to Mean Something, to “emblemize the triumph of the human spirit,” as one well-coiffed South Carolina senator phrased it. Who doesn’t want to rationalize their traumas, if only to preserve their conception of the universe as an ordered system in which righteousness and evil are easily distinguishable?</p>
<p>It is for their sakes, then, that we have kept the truth to ourselves: that there is no meaning to be gleaned from our scars, no arcane wisdom, only a cold, sinister reminder that at best everything is only temporary. Even us.</p>
<p>Maybe this is why our hands instinctively seek out our scars as we approach the pond, the calm surface, sparkling plaintively in the moonlight. Notice, for instance, how Emily Lepisto clasps her left wrist, feeling the twin dimples from the slug that left her unable to bend her fingers more than a few degrees. Or see Adam Kravski remove his Clemson cap and absently trace the mottled pink ridge running from one side of his head to the other, making his skull look like a Phillips’ head screw. Altogether we carry 5.8 pounds of titanium alloys in the form of cranial plates, bone screws, artificial knee caps, and spinal fusion cages. So far we have undergone a total of seventy-one surgeries to repair punctured lungs, perforated bowels, temporal bone fractures, cerebral contusions, pulmonary lacerations, intracranial hematomas, arteriovenous fistulas, hemothorax, periocardial tamponade. Three of us have suffered neurological impairments that, while thankfully having no effect on our cognitive abilities, will prevent us from ever driving again. One of us is now blind in one eye.</p>
<p>The most iconic clip from the video diary features Travis standing with his back to the pond, dressed in a black t-shirt and cargo pants, clutching the weapon, a Bushmaster .223 semiautomatic rifle purchased online with a fake ID, to his tawny chest. <i>This is my manifesto</i>, he says robotically into the tripod-mounted camera. <i>For too long I have been ridiculed and tormented. Now the guilty must pay, the fakes and the liars. You brought this on yourselves</i>.</p>
<p>It is this clip alone that has allowed him in our memories to take on the impossible dimensions of a mythical figure—half human, half speculation, a stunning contrast to the nervous, lanky, fair-skinned boy we’d see skulking through the halls like a death row inmate on his way to the gas chamber. He was never very popular outside of his cohort of friends, with whom he usually spent his lunch hour in the AV lab playing Jenga; with their bad skin and anime t-shirts, they all seemed interminably trapped on the edge of adolescence in a way that made them outcasts, foreigners amongst the rest of us. Beyond this, we knew almost nothing about his personal life, other than that he had an older sister, Tori, who had graduated before any of us had started high school but whose promiscuity remained something of a legend amongst the students (she was rumored to have once taken part in a house party game to see which of five girls could fellate the most boys in a half hour and, as a consequence, had to have her stomach pumped of semen; that no one was ever able to verify this did not stop us from trading the story time and again like gospel). His parents, we learned after the attack, had been divorced for most of his life; his mother was a paralegal in Conway, and his father had a wife and two other children and owned a four-wheeler dealership in New Orleans.</p>
<p>But it’s the seemingly innocuous memories of Travis that have taken on the most retrospective weight in our minds. Whitney Smith remembers when he chose <i>Mein Kampf</i> for his end-of-the-year research project in sophomore English, and how annoyed Janice Arendale was when it took first prize in the annual CHS Writing Contest, beating out her sonnet about her family trip to Mexico (<i>He only chose that book to get attention</i> she was overheard complaining to a classmate). Kevin Molarno recalls the two straight weeks he wore sunglasses for no apparent reason, and how he used to draw flames on his tennis shoes. Brian Vick remembers when, during a fetal pig dissection in his sophomore bio lab, he began to dry heave into the sink and had to be escorted into the hall by Mrs. Odell, where he spent the remainder of the period sobbing hysterically.</p>
<p>Maybe these were nothing more than the hallmarks of awkward adolescence—we were all teenagers, after all, gloomy in our own ways and terrified of what the world had to offer—but in our minds they now seem hopelessly laden with significance, like opportunities that only reveal themselves once you’ve missed them.</p>
<p>On the September morning in question, he strode into the gym with the rifle in his hands just as the dance team was finishing up a routine. “We didn’t know what we were seeing, not at first,” DeShaun Burgess would later comment in a CNN news feed. “We all thought maybe it was, like, part of a skit or something.” It was Coach Barnes, an Iraq War vet (the fact of which has received almost as much coverage as the shooting itself, not to mention whispers of a made-for-TV-movie option) who first realized what was happening. Leaping up from the bleachers, he yelled “Get down!” and then darted across the court toward Travis, presumably with the intention of tackling him. Travis, clad in the same black paramilitary garb he’d worn in the video diary, took aim and, with an eerie calm, shot the coach through the right eye. The man’s head snapped back violently as if yanked by an invisible string, and then he dropped to the floor in mid-step; at least three radio talk show hosts would make comparisons to the Kennedy assassination.</p>
<p>A chorus of terrified screams rose up from the bleachers. Students flooded the floor all at once, clamoring for the exits, tripping and trampling each other, despite the teachers’ frantic attempts to corral them into the halls. The thick pops of the rifle resounded throughout the room, big as planets, while all around us it seemed bodies were collapsing unceremoniously, shredded by gunfire. The scorched smell of cordite, the panicked tang of sweat. For some of us, like Katie Wilkes, the blasts hit with enough scalding force to send us flying off our feet. Others didn’t even realize at first that they had been hit, as in the case of Doug Castalabri, who, propelled by adrenaline and fear, assumed the blood on his shirt was someone else’s, until once outside the building he noticed the dime-sized hole in his abdomen.</p>
<p>Altogether, Travis Covington fired off 74 rounds in approximately 3.2 minutes before turning the gun on himself. Ballistics reports would later describe the shooting pattern as “random and uncoordinated.” The video diary was aired by every major news network in the country, and Travis, who had made a science of going unnoticed for most of his life, the same kid who hadn’t had the stomach to make it through a fetal pig dissection, he became the most popular search term online for nearly four weeks straight.</p>
<p>As for possible motives, people have suggested maybe video games drove him to it, or the absence of his father, or milk hormones, or perhaps even his ADD—the kind of paltry straws people are prone to grasp at in these situations, but you can never really know a person, not in the way we would like. And that’s the worst part, honestly, trying to find a singular cause, knowing all the while that such things don’t exist. Aren’t we naturally predisposed to believe, despite all reason, that tragedy serves some higher moral function? Isn’t that what this afternoon’s assembly is all about?</p>
<p>But no: tragedy has the same point of origin as everything else, and searching for it only makes you understand how little your own survival actually accomplishes.</p>
<p>And so this is why now, standing at the mucky edge of the pond with the reeds swishing gently against our ankles, we begin to undress, each of us without a word, because what do we have to hide now? The cool air slides over our skins like strangers’ fingertips in a crowd, arousing the fine hairs on our arms and legs. Then, leaving our clothes in piles in the grass, we wade chastely into the frigid water.</p>
<p>In the brittle moonlight, our bare bodies glow spectral, our scars rendered practically invisible. Could this be all that healing amounts to, outlasting whatever you thought was keeping you safe? Moving farther out into the pond, we think about the video diary<i>. </i>We remember the footage of Travis’ target practice sessions, and we imagine the bottom of the pond as a vast carpet of glass shards waiting to slice the feet of unsuspecting swimmers. Just like the childhood monsters beneath our beds. That’s where the danger always lives, at the bottom of everything. Hidden, but closer than anyone would like to believe.</p>
<p><i></i><i>You brought this on yourselves.</i></p>
<p>Now we lie back in the water and close our eyes and drift listlessly out toward the center of the pond. We are alone here and the night is silent save for the trilling of crickets and the wind against the grass and the water lapping gently at our goose-rippled skins. We float like corpses, the nineteen of us, wholly exposed, limbs splayed like the points of stars as we wait for whatever is beneath us to reveal itself.</p>
