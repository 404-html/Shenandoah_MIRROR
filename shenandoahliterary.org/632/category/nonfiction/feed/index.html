								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A plastic fawn, palm-sized, lives on my office desk. He gazes at my open office door. His right front hoof is raised, poised for haste.</p>
<p>The deer of my Mississippi childhood were the Virginia whitetail, <i>Odocoileus virginianus virginianus</i>. As a child ten years or so, fresh from reading Felix Salten’s <i>Bambi</i>, I rested my forehead against backseat car windows and took in miles and miles of Mississippi forest. Commutes between school and our isolated house were long. I imagined myself a whitetailed doe, keeping up with the car through those woods, a blur of velvet hide and muscle.</p>
<p>I now walk to campus in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The <i>odocoileus virginianus virginianus, </i>the Virginia whitetail, emerge from the battlefields, animal grace among memorials and hardwoods. My round-eyed dog and I greet all deer with silence when we exercise in the morning light.</p>
<p>My toy fawn is a whitetail. On the job in my office, he has my back while I peck at my computer, even though he cannot know that I hear the student or the fellow professor before he sees them. Sometimes I reward him for his diligence. He holidays with a toy brontosaurus in my desktop terrarium. “Winter garden” my student from New Zealand calls it, a name I find lovely.</p>
<p>As a child of ten years or so I had a Disney Bambi bedspread, a modest covering for any young girl’s bed furnishing a bedroom in a one story rancher, a house on a mowed lawn, a residence that in a cropped picture could be part of an established a cul-de-sac. But if the photographer panned out, she would reveal barbed wire fencing and overgrown thorny bushes in sunbaked pastures. And if the photographer zoomed in on the cut green grass, she would see mosquitoes swarming, fire ants presiding, weeds encroaching. Inside that rural house in the depths of Mississippi a child of ten years or so could walk barefoot into her bedroom and find her stepfather sprawled on her bed, nude, his privates mashed into Bambi’s face.</p>
<p>No safe territory exists for the Virginia whitetail. From alligators down south to wolves up north, the whitetail deer is prey. We humans hunt deer for sport and for food. We humans do not possess the necessary reflexes to avoid running our cars and trucks right into a deer on a dark country road.</p>
<p>The first time a doe found me, a girl of six or so years old, sitting on my haunches in an old roadbed, my red knee socks quite a pop of color against the autumn leaves covering the ground, she stared deep and she stared true. Regal, she scanned my soul. She weighed my goodness. Perhaps she saw that I wanted, more than anything, to be different from the man who held the title to the land on which we found ourselves, the man my mother had married. Perhaps the doe in her eternal gaze could forsee that I would flee Mississippi and eventually find refuge in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Maybe she saw the future, me laughing during dinner in a two-story home with my husband, two children, and a round-eyed dog, a home with no secrets except at Christmastime.</p>
<p>In most US states, deer hunting is illegal on Christmas Day, including Pennsylvania. For the first time in almost one hundred years, no Pennsylvania hunter accidentally killed a fellow hunter during hunting season. Upon finding a dead hunter in the woods Bambi’s stag mentor says that the human is “just the same as we are. He has the same fears, the same needs, and suffers in the same way.”</p>
<p>As my father was dying of cancer he requested that his body donated to science. His Agent Orange induced cancer had stalked his liver, his kidneys, his lungs, and finally his brain. My father envisioned others studying his corpse, a failed battle map, finding some small secret, a way to undermine the hunter. No medical school honored his request. Perhaps his body had been too damaged to be of use.</p>
<p>Even though the deer has natural predators, they nevertheless can overpopulate. At a nuclear physics laboratory in the hills of Tennessee, as in other places around the country, annual hunts keep the deer numbers in check. But in Tennessee, hunters go through an extra procedure. Back when the laboratory had, as its first priority, a mission to develop a fission bomb before the Nazis did, before the Russians did, mistakes were made in terms of environmental waste. As a result, the woods around this nuclear physics laboratory in the green hills of Tennessee have water and soil that has been activated, contaminated, by radiation. Deer eating the foliage, drinking the pond water, may become activated too. Strontium, like Marie Curie’s radium, is a bone seeker. If the dead buck or doe has a dose higher than one and a half times the background radiation levels, the deer carcass is retained by the laboratory, too damaged to be of use.</p>
<p>A girl, six or ten or thirteen years old, squats on her haunches in an old Mississippi roadbed, her socks a pop of color against the autumn leaves. If the child is patient, the whitetail will seem to welcome the company. That doe, that sylvan queen, will over many visits show the child a hidden light and high beauty forever beyond the reach of man. The child will learn that any injustice, any hurt at the hands of another is only a small and passing thing. And in times of darkness, the child imagines a future where she, like the whitetail, could sprint at thirty miles per hour, leap over an adult’s head, and disappear.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New Shoes</p>
<p>You’re on your hands and knees, looking side to side beneath the tattered bus seats.  In front of you are new white tennis shoes, size three or four, and above them frayed and yellowed socks, and above the socks a young girl’s thin brown ankles, like chocolate-painted bones.</p>
<p>What else?</p>
<p>Other brown ankles, other shoes, but none are this close, this bright, this white, this new.  Metal bus-seat poles bolted to the black, filthy floor line up into the near distance like centipede legs.  But why are you on the ground?</p>
<p>Follow the images.  Remember.</p>
<p>You’re five, riding in the front of the school bus your mother drives every day through the Pine Chapel projects of Hampton, Virginia.  She is in her late-20s, pregnant with your brother.  The two of you are the only white people on the bus.  Behind you are about 50 of the poorest African-American kids in the state, kindergartners to eighth graders.  Each weekday morning and afternoon in 1976, only a few years after the last desegregation lawsuits, you sit by yourself in the first loose, spring-creaking chair behind Mom’s driver’s seat, legs dangling, listening to the talk, the laughing, and the cursing of the black kids.  You now know the words motherfucker fuck you bitch dick coochie ass faggot shit.  Language is a marvel (coochie?)—almost a solid material for building thought, memory, fantasy.  Most of your life is in your own head.  Such a good boy, people say.  So quiet.  But your mind is a rapids, anything but quiet.</p>
<p>Perhaps you’ve dropped something—a coin, one of the plastic toy figures of Batman or Aquaman you always had with you then, something—and now you’re on your hands and knees to pick it up.  You can see all the way to the teal, steel back of the bus.  But it’s these shoes that draw your eye.  Cheap, white, new.</p>
<p>Shoes have meaning.  Shoes tell a story.  Not how you think, of course, not at five, but something you seem to know because the teenage boys in your neighborhood, a white working-class neighborhood with poor black neighborhoods nearby, wear blue Puma Clydes, or bright white Adidas Stan Smiths with three green stripes, or blue and yellow Nike running shoes with tan knobby soles.  They parade these shoes, they runway-fashion-stroll them; every day you can see the boys belong together because of their shoes.  There are other things that connect them together as well—medium-length, feathered hair parted in the middle, T-shirts screen-printed with words like “Cheap Trick” and “Foghat” and “Jethro Tull” and “Pink Floyd,” their white skin.  But it’s the shoes that really mean, or so it seems, and it is cheap canvas shoes, what the teenage boys call “butter cookies,” that can truly damn a person, subject them to the cruelest words, bullying.  Your mother drives a school bus.  Your father works at the nearby shipyard.  Money is tight, your family never has enough (none of which do you know or understand), but you wear Nikes and if you didn’t you would be trash like your neighbors the Heeleys.</p>
<p>So when you get up from the bus floor—maybe with a plastic Batman in hand—you look back at the girl, at her face, then the older boy sitting beside her—her brother, you think—then the girl again.  She does not look you in the eye.  Her glasses are thick, plastic, cheap; her downcast eyes are magnified like a fish in the corner of an aquarium, like a squeezed balloon.  She is small, skinny.  About your age—five, maybe six.  Not clean.  Her black hair is coarse, wiry almost, parted in the middle with two tight braids drooping like weak stalks from the root of her head.  You would like her to look at you.  For the first time on this bus, you have something to say to one of the black kids.</p>
<p>Before you got your Nikes, before your mother relented to your begging for Nikes, the older boys in your neighborhood laughed at your shoes every day when they walked by you as you rode your yellow, plastic skateboard with the translucent, rubber-cement-colored wheels on your short driveway and the thump-tump uneven sidewalk in front of your house.  They said your mother drove the nig taxi.  They said, Check tike’s kicks or nice moccasins ke-mo-therapy then laughed, pushing each other.  You didn’t understand exactly what they meant, or why your white canvas shoes from K-Mart that your grandmother bought you were such a joke, but you felt the sting from their comments, their laughing, went inside.  No more skateboarding? said Mom.  Nah, you said, then sat on the flowered couch in the small, dim living room in the silence and the tea-stain light and the boredom (time felt so big at five, like an ocean to swim through, like having your eyes open while you slept, the hours a dark, unmoving sludge).  You looked down at your shoes.  Such crap crap shoes.  Butter cookies.  But then Christmas came and you wanted only one thing and you got your blue Nikes.</p>
<p>You’re leaning over the back of your seat now.  You and the black girl and her brother are face-to-face inside the roaring tunnel of the bus.  Did you have meanness in you as a kid?  Hard to know, really, since the child’s mind is the adult’s story, a thing you’re making on this laptop, a fiction we tell ourselves to grant some meaning to our pasts, but you remembered the older white boys laughing at your shoes, celebrating a new thing wrong with you.  A hurt thing wants to hurt.  That much you know.</p>
<p>You say only two words: nice shoes; then you laugh, your best neighborhood cool-kid derisive—like spitting on those embarrassing, no-brand shoes.</p>
<p>The boy beside the girl, her brother, is the “bus monitor.”  He helps your mother keep control of the violence, which hums in the air some days.  (Your father says the poor will fight to the finish over scraps, can be murderous over wounded pride, will steal useless things because useless things are still one notch up from nothing at all, and he does not like that your mother cannot find a better, safer job—the grocery store, helping out at a pre-school—that his low salary reduces freedom, forces your parents to make choices they don’t want to make.)  The girl’s brother is like your mother’s fight cop.  Mom says he is a gentleman, going somewhere.  “No fights” is her one remaining rule.  Wanna fight? he says to kids, standing up, eyeing them.  Get off the bus in the projects and kill each other.  Nobody cares.  Police don’t care.  Save their ass a bullet.  But no fighting on the white lady’s bus.</p>
<p>He scowls at your laugh now.  You think he must share your opinion of the girl’s shoes—you assume everyone understands that she should be wearing Nikes, not those sad $2.99 K-Mart specials.  This is inviolable logic.  You learned it from the white boys in your neighborhood.</p>
<p>He doesn’t laugh.  Instead he leans in toward you.  You look at him, listen.  You’re still smiling.  He helps your mother.  He can be trusted.  He looks at his younger sister, who sits with him every day, her new shoes, which still smell of pressed rubber and canvas, of the caved-in box they came over in from China.  Quietly, so your mother cannot hear, he says, What are you laughin at you little white motherfucker?  I bought them damn shoes.  I’d take off one and beat your little ass with it, bitch, your momma won’t sitting right there.  Turn the fuck around ‘fore I slap your face.</p>
<p>Little electric shock goes right through your forehead and all around inside your skull, staticking every thought.  You turn around.  Heart a marcher’s snare.  You hold your picked-up toy, Batman or Aquaman, tight in both hands.  You cross and re-cross your shins, as if to hide your expensive shoes.  Too scared to even cry.</p>
<p>At home you lie sock-footed on the flowered couch and watch Tom and Jerry torture and terrorize each other.  You do not mention to your mother what happened on the bus, what the girl’s brother said.  The next day, walking out of the slappy screen door of the house for the morning route, she asks why you aren’t wearing your new shoes.</p>
<p>Confederate Flag in the Grocery Store</p>
<p>The back of a grocery store.  This is now.  In New England.  Florescent lights glaring in the glass doors of the refrigerated foods section, making yellow window eyes that follow you as you browse.  Price tags.  Special! Special!  Labels of every color facing you.  Pink, green, orange.  Red, blue, red, blue, red, blue.  And your mind, your memory, suddenly goes back, and back, and back.  And this now loses its grip altogether and becomes Virginia decades ago.</p>
<p>You are looking at a young man named Jimmy, a crabber from Hampton.  He is bow-legged, in jeans and a red flannel shirt and a filthy, tattered-billed baseball cap.  You look down at his white work boots, the creek-mud splotches like coffee stains, back up to his sun-toughened, wind-cracked face.  He is 20, 21.  He looks 35.</p>
<p>He’s buying dinner maybe.  No, he’s buying, more precisely—some clarity now—milk and bread, and your memory—or the raw images from your memory (glare of light, rainbow of labels, squeak of boots on white, tile floors)—shifts from the back of the grocery store, the dairy section, where he looks at you and then turns quickly away, embarrassed—but you don’t know why yet—to the front of the store, the checkout line, where he is paying for his groceries with food stamps, which surprises you because you think, as a teen (you must have been a late teen, maybe 18), that local fishermen and crabbers make a decent living.  (At this moment in life, in the quick sliding of time, you think many wrong things.)</p>
<p>You know Jimmy from little league sports, though he’s two or three years older than you.  Embarrassment speeds his heart, and the skin on his neck pinks as you intrude on this transaction of food and food stamps when you stand too close in the line behind him.  Like getting behind someone buying tampons or hemorrhoid cream or flavored condoms at the drug store.  Pretend you haven’t noticed.  Look at the magazines in the cheap metal racks:  An actor’s secret battle with pain medication; cellulite solutions; 7 tricks to please your man; lose weight having sex—and look great!</p>
<p>Jimmy pulls a patch of a Confederate flag from the back pocket of his jeans.  It’s about the size of a playing card, edges frayed, but still bright red and blue, and he looks at you and smiles and says hey man long time and then says you should put the patch on your jean jacket if you want to let everyone know how you feel about blacks, though that is not how he says it, of course, that is not how you will really remember it, of course.</p>
<p>Here is a young white man, still with the gestures and bashfulness of an insecure boy, using the Confederate flag to leap over the fact that he is working poor and needs government help to eat, that he feels different in the bright lights of the store when he holds the food stamps, when he passes them to the cashier, inferior and weak and hopeless.</p>
<p>You won’t remember how you reacted to Jimmy’s offer of the Confederate flag patch, whether you took it or not—you probably did; caught off guard catching someone off guard, the hesitance and feeling-whiplash of that kind of moment, why wouldn’t you have?—but you will remember his blushing face, remember how desperate he looked, wide-eyed, caught up and contained in his shame, wanting more than anything not to be poor, to be better than somebody, anybody.  The last, defensive thought of so many of the poor white Southerners from your boyhood:  At least I’m not black.</p>
<p>Your son—back in the now now, back in New England, which feels like a different country—says, ready Dad? and you say yep and, milk jug in hand, leave the memory in the back of the grocery store, reminding yourself to write it down later.</p>
<p>Bullet Hole</p>
<p>Looks like your asshole.</p>
<p>Your neighbor Rodney Dean said that—you think—or maybe his older brother Kip.  One of them.  But you remember staring into the bullet hole in the car’s driver’s side door, six inches below the window, a few inches forward from the door handle.   Rodney is thirteen.  Kip is eighteen, and this is his metal-flake blue Chevelle in front of you, in the Dean’s cracked, weed-sprouting driveway.   You’re seven.  Nineteen seventy-seven.  Holiday season.   (Lay down the facts without literary fuss—make it pretty later, if you must.)  You’ve come next door to hear the story of the shooting, because this house, this family, this junk-strewn yard—storyville.</p>
<p>For instance:<br />
The earth was made by God in six days about six-thousand years ago.<br />
Cutting your hair if you are a woman is a sin.<br />
Showing your legs if you are a woman is a sin.<br />
Wearing pants instead of long dresses or skirts if you are a woman is a sin.<br />
Talking to a strange boy if you are a girl is a sin.<br />
Men can punish women, in public, physically, for their sins.</p>
<p>You have seen the father, the snaggle-toothed, wrinkled mechanic, the amateur Southern Baptist evangelist, beat each of his four daughters with a belt or a switch in the front yard (his four boys, too, but that seems less odd to you because you yourself have been beaten with a belt until you couldn’t breathe).  We live in God’s dominion, according to Mr. Dean, and the chosen shall lead us into being a fully Christian nation, not one filled with communists and dope fiends and queers.  Also according to Mr. Dean:  The black kids in the neighborhoods nearby are like roving platoons from an enemy army.  Whites made this country.  It is a white, Christian country.  Whites must take it back.  In Jesus’ name.  Amen.</p>
<p>Looks like your asshole.  All wide and blown-in like that, you hell-fire faggot.</p>
<p>So now you get the story (there you are, the listener, hands in dungaree pockets) but have a hard time following the plot.  Act 1:  Rachel, the middle girl, fourteen, went into the Pine Chapel projects by herself because she had a friend from her class who lived there.  The friend was black.  She knows not to go there.  She goes anyway.  The friend had an older brother and some cousins and maybe strangers living with her and her grandma.  Someone on the school bus told Rodney, the younger brother, that Rachel had a black boyfriend.  Act 2:  Big joke on the bus, repeated over and over:  white girl, black boy.  Rodney told Kip but didn’t tell his dad.  Act 3:  Dusk came.  A cold night.  Kip went out in his Chevelle, picked up some friends—two, three; you don’t clearly hear this part—and they drove through Pine Chapel with bats and crowbars.  They drank beer after beer and got braver.  Black teens on the corners watched them roll by once but not again.  Second time Kip’s friend started yelling.  Another of Kip’s friends flashed a pistol.  Then from the other side of the road a loud bang, driver’s-side door pinging like a shot beer can.  Right then a gang of twenty, thirty project kids come running around the corner, shadows under the street lights, and Kip and the boys are burning rubber and back home in a few minutes.  Act 4:  Rachel arrives home, an hour late and after lying about where she went.  No boyfriend, just a friend, a girl, yes a black friend but we had a project to do.  I promise.  I promise.</p>
<p>Now is Act 5:  You think you understand.  Maybe you don’t.  Kip and Rodney are still talking, half joking, half fighting.  You watch.  The thing you must do in life, you understand, is pay attention, follow along.</p>
<p>Here is Mr. Dean with his pepper crew cut, his missing teeth, his gray, cracked fingers, pushing his daughter Rachel by the neck out into the yard, to the car.  You see that? he shouts.  See that?  She says, Yes, she does, she does see it, but she only went to do a project for school and Kip didn’t have to come after her and drive around like that with music blaring and his friends shouting out the windows at the people who live there.</p>
<p>Mr. Dean slaps the back of Rachel’s head and her never-cut hair whips like a clothes-lined dress in the wind.  All because of your evil ways, Mr. Dean says, pointing at the bullet hole with one hand and vice-gripping her neck with the other.  Stay with your kind, he repeats as the swinging starts up again.  You and Kip and Rodney look on as their father beats Rachel with the force of worship.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>1.  Written in 1772 BC, Hammurabi’s Code contains the earliest known laws for justifiable execution.</p>
<p>2.  For example, if a man accuses another man of an injustice, the accused man will be plunged into a river, and, if innocent, he will rise to the river’s surface.  Conversely, unseen hands will draw him, if guilty, to the silt and darkness of the river bottom.  Should the man reach the river’s shore, the accuser will be put to death, and all he owns will be forfeited to the innocent man.</p>
<p>3.  Lex talionis, the law of retaliation, undergirds Hammurabi’s Code: “If a man put out the eye of another man, his eye shall be put out.”</p>
<p>4.  Deuteronomy, the fifth book of the Hebrew Bible, also advocates for lex talionis.</p>
<p>5.  Christ advocated for the law of forgiveness, as did Gandhi, and Martin Luther King.</p>
<p>6.  Mid-execution, Christ called out, “Father, forgive them, they know not what they do.”</p>
<p>7.  The word “excruciating” derives from the Latin word, “excruciates,” meaning, “out of the cross.”</p>
<p>8.  When Narayan Godse, Gandhi’s assassin, was executed by hanging in 1949, Gandhi’s two sons pleaded unsuccessfully for Godse’s life to be spared.</p>
<p>9.  King’s assassin, James Earle Ray, evaded execution with a guilty plea, which he later attempted to recant, and then died in prison from complications of hepatitis C.</p>
<p>10.  Robert Kennedy, when telling a gathered crowd in Indianapolis of King’s death, read aloud a poem by Aeschylus.</p>
<p>11.  From a podium erected on a flatbed truck, Robert Kennedy stayed the swelling anger of the crowd: Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget, falls drop by drop upon the heart…</p>
<p>12.  His own assassin, Sirhan Sirhan, was sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted to life in prison when the California Supreme Court invalidated all pending death sentences in 1972.</p>
<p>13.  As bodyguards and crowd members attempted to subdue Sirhan Sirhan, a seventeen-year-old busboy named Juan Romero cradled Robert Kennedy’s head and placed a rosary in Kennedy’s palm.</p>
<p>14.  When Robert Kennedy addressed the crowd in Indianapolis, he spoke in public for the first time about his brother’s assassination.</p>
<p>15.  Five years prior, while his dog Sheba waited in the car, Jack Ruby, on national television, executed Lee Harvey Oswald with a snub-nosed Colt .38 revolver.</p>
<p>16.  Sentenced to death and awaiting a new trial, Jack Ruby was executed by pulmonary embolism brought on by lung cancer.  Ruby and Oswald both died at Parkland Hospital, the same hospital at which John F. Kennedy had been pronounced dead.</p>
<p>17.  Jacqueline Kennedy introduced Robert Kennedy to Aeschylus’ writing when he was grieving the death of his brother.</p>
<p>18.  Aeschylus, the father of tragedy, believed that knowledge arises from suffering.</p>
<p>19.  In his plays, Aeschylus executes character after character.  Even Cassandra, whose ears were licked clean by snakes in Apollo’s temple so that she might hear the future, could not escape her execution by Clytemnestra.</p>
<p>20.  In 456 BC, Aeschylus himself, the legend claims, was executed when an eagle dropped a tortoise from the sky.</p>
<p>21.  Animals figure prominently in execution lore.</p>
<p>22.  In the Twelve Tablets of the Roman Law, the crime of patricide called for the condemned to be drowned inside a sack that also contained a dog, a rooster, a viper, and an ape.</p>
<p>23.  In an execution for sport, three hotel owners in Niagara, NY, in 1827, obtained a condemned schooner, decorated it as a pirate ship, filled it with animals, and sent it over Horseshoe Falls to the delight of 15,000 spectators.</p>
<p>24.  The boat (the <em>Michigan</em>) was supposed to contain “animals of the most ferocious kind, such as panthers, wild cats and wolves,” yet when the boat went over the falls, it contained only a buffalo, two raccoons, a dog, and a goose.</p>
<p>25.  In 1903, Thomas Edison, in an execution for business, electrocuted Topsy, a twenty-eight-year-old elephant from Coney Island’s Luna Park.  The execution was sanctioned because Topsy had killed three men over the previous three years.</p>
<p>26.  J.F. Blount, one of Topsy’s keepers, had tried to feed her a lit cigarette, and she lifted him with her trunk and dashed him on the ground.</p>
<p>27.  Hanging had been considered as a means of execution for Topsy, but Edison stepped in and suggested electrocution by alternating current.  To alert the public of the current’s danger, Edison insisted that the execution be filmed.</p>
<p>28.  George Westinghouse, Edison’s chief competitor, championed alternating current.  Edison championed direct current.</p>
<p>29.  To guarantee Topsy’s execution, Topsy was fed carrots laced with cyanide.</p>
<p>30.  One newspaper reported, “The execution was witnessed by 1,500 or more curious persons, who went down to the island to see the end of the huge beast, to whom they had fed peanuts and cakes in summers that are gone…”</p>
<p>31.  When Edison’s stunt couldn’t impede the rise of alternating current, Edison advocated for its use in the electric chair.  He even tried to make Westinghouse’s name into a verb.  To Edison, death by electric chair meant getting “Westinghoused.”</p>
<p>32.  In 1890, the first execution by electric chair was less than a rousing success.</p>
<p>33.  William Kemmler, a citizen of Buffalo, NY who killed his common-law wife with a hatchet, received 1,000 volts for seventeen seconds.  When the doctors noticed that Kemmler was still breathing, they increased the voltage to 2,000 volts.  Blood vessels ruptured under his skin, and the stench of singeing hair filled the chamber.</p>
<p>34.  When he heard of the debacle, George Westinghouse said, without irony, “They would have done better using an axe.”</p>
<p>35.  The word “electrocution” initially only referred to intentional execution by electricity, but soon encompassed accidental death by electricity as well.</p>
<p>36.  “Old Sparky,” the electric chair at Sing Sing prison, was used in all executions in New York State from 1914 to 1963.</p>
<p>37.  Willie Francis, in 1946, became the first person to survive the electric chair.</p>
<p>38.  An intoxicated prison guard in Angola, Louisiana incorrectly installed a portable electric chair named “Gruesome Gertie.”  When the switch was thrown, Willie Francis allegedly yelled, “Take it off!  Let me breathe!”</p>
<p>39.  His case went to the Supreme Court, and his lawyers argued that even though Willie Frances did not die, he had, in fact, been executed.</p>
<p>40.  The Supreme Court was not persuaded, and Willie Francis was re-executed successfully in 1947.</p>
<p>41.  Yet there have been successful escapes.</p>
<p>42.  Back in Niagara, New York, before the <em>Michigan</em> went over Horseshoe Falls, two small bears that had been placed on the boat leapt into the Niagara River and swam to Goat Island when the Michigan began to tear apart in the rapids.</p>
<p>43.  Rescued downriver after going over the falls, the goose also survived.</p>
<p>44.  In 1915, Wenseslao Moguel survived nine shots from a firing squad during the Mexican Revolution.  Presumed dead, he waited until the solders left and then crawled to safety, making a business from his mangled face and touring the country for the second half of his life.</p>
<p>45.  To conclude, there is this: If knowledge rises from suffering, what is to be made of Frano Selak?</p>
<p>46.  Frano Selak: the Croatian music teacher who escaped death seven times, who survived a train crash into an icy river, a fall from a plane where he landed in a haystack, a bus crash, two car crashes (one of which burned away all of his hair when fuel spewed from the air vents), being knocked down by a van, and, lastly, having his car hit by a United Nations bus as he turned a corner on a mountain road, catapulting him to the canopy of a tree as his car exploded below him on the mountainside.</p>
<p>47.  In 2006, Frano won one million dollars with a lottery ticket he bought in celebration of his fifth wedding.</p>
<p>48.  The ticket was the first he had ever purchased.</p>
<p>49.  In an interview, he said he was the happiest he had been in his life.  He said, “All I need at my age is my Katarina.  Money would not change anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>50.  He donated most of the winnings to charity and relatives, setting aside funds only for his hip replacement and to build a shrine for St. Mary, whom he viewed as the mother of all, whose own son, like Frano, had demonstrated power over the grave.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your first and only incision will be right over the sternum. All birds have a bald patch there. Blow lightly on the breast until the feathers begin to part and you can see the pale skin beneath.</p>
<p>Rest your finger there for a moment. Feel the bone your blade will follow. Make a wish, if you must, and then slice from collar to belly carefully.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>I used to keep the letters my father had written to me in a box with all of my other letters. There were three of them, all written before I was eight, on lined paper with a ripped, spiral fringe. He put them into the envelopes he sent my mother. Otherwise, they were empty, except for a check, always made out for $75. Sometimes the envelopes came from Alaska or Tahiti.</p>
<p>When I was a little older, if I saw the mail before my mother, I would feel the envelopes, to see if they were thicker than just-a-check.</p>
<p>You will need to cut the spinal column and trachea before you go any further. To do this, carefully work a small surgical probe between the skin and neck muscles at the very top of your cut. The curved tip is blunt, and if you advance it slowly, it shouldn’t tear the skin. Work it behind the neck until you can see it on the other side. Then slide the lower blade of a scissor along the steel. When you can see the scissor’s point, cut.</p>
<p>On larger birds, you may need to cut two or three times, blindly. This is why the probe is important: it keeps you from cutting through the back of the neck and beheading your specimen.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>I stayed at my father’s parents&#8217; house a few times as a child, usually when he was visiting, too. Even though he had a local apartment twice, I never stayed at either one. In the second apartment—which he took me to once for just a moment—I had my own room. I looked in through the darkened doorway and saw a bed and bedside table, no lamp, and then we had to leave.</p>
<p>I never stayed alone with him until I was in college. This doesn’t feel ominous, just disconnected.</p>
<p>His parents lived in a double-wide trailer, in the yard of a landlord I never met. I slept in his little brother’s old room.</p>
<p>After the neck is cut, you will slip the wings from their bones like a jacket.</p>
<p>To do this, repeat the following steps for each side: using your fingers, pinch the humerus below the shoulder joint and slide the skin away from the muscles like you are taking off tight jeans or panty hose.</p>
<p>Keep rolling the skin from the structure until you feel a boniness branch off from the ulna, just past what would be the elbow joint. This is the first primary feather. Use your fingernail to scrape it out—as you would a wasp’s stinger in your own arm. There will be a few primaries. Pop them from the bone one by one, and then cut the humerus close to the shoulder. Be careful not to cut through the skin. Both wings should be intact in the final specimen.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Uncle John had hundreds of comic books. I lay in that strange bed and read them through hours of sleeplessness. I preferred Casper and Archie to the superheroes because of the simplicity of their drawings. Hulk and Iron Man comics seemed busy and cramped; I couldn’t always tell what was happening.</p>
<p>My grandmother, his mother, was an Avon lady; she sometimes let me take home tiny lipstick samples of last season’s colors. She had an impressive collection of facsimile whiskey decanters shaped like famous people and a kangaroo skin my father had brought her from Australia.</p>
<p>My grandfather had a wooden leg and a glass eye. I was not told this, but discovered the prosthetics while snooping. I was told that he used to drink homemade corn liquor that he filtered through loaves of coarse wheat bread. He did this a long time before I was born. I don’t remember who told me that.</p>
<p>When both wings are free from the body, gently peel the back skin from the muscle. If it sticks, as can be the case with some freezer-burned birds, use the probe and scalpel to loosen or cut through the scab.</p>
<p>You will cut the legs by rolling the skin away from them as you did with the wings, but stop sooner, before you get to the scaled leg skin. Cut the thigh bone even closer to the body than you did on the wings.</p>
<p>Now pinch the tail ligaments and cut just above where you can feel the feathers end. If you cut too high, it will be a bit messy, but not unsalvageable. If you cut too low, the tail will fall off. This can’t be fixed, so err on the side of a mess.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>My father’s mother would fry trout in thick oil for dinner.</p>
<p>We ate peanut butter and mayonnaise on white bread for lunch. I asked that this sandwich be put in my bagged lunch, when I got back home to my mother.</p>
<p>For breakfast, my grandmother would make tiny pancakes for my father and me. He would put butter and jam on them, instead of syrup. He would roll them up like cigars and eat them with his hands. So would I.</p>
<p>The body, separated, should resemble a very small version of a fryer or turkey. Notice that the muscle tissue of songbirds, however, is all dark meat.</p>
<p>You will carefully collect tissue samples from the breast, heart, and liver now, and determine the sex of the bird. You may also need to collect stomach contents.</p>
<p>Follow the photocopied instructions for this step. Use the small plastic vials, and consider all samples dry unless your collections manager tells you to store them wet, as is sometimes the case with rare specimens.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>My mother never spoke ill of him, I want to say that. But the spaces between his contact swelled with meaning by the time I got to high school. First his father died, and then his mother. I asked him if I could come to her funeral, after I learned of it from my mother’s mother—her neighbor. I smoked Marlboro Lights in front of him for the first time that weekend.</p>
<p>I stayed with him and one of the women he married a couple of times, once in Spokane and once in Pleasant Hill, California. She had older children, cut his meat for him, and talked in a nasal, baby voice.</p>
<p>He didn’t travel overseas anymore, but would frequently overspend. During one visit, he bought a new car and a giant television. Then, he got a nosebleed and sat in the center of his bed staring into space. His wife said, “Go comfort him!” Their marriage may have lasted ten years. Maybe less.</p>
<p>The head is difficult, so take your time.</p>
<p>Start by pinching the neck and working the skin away from and over the back of the skull. When you get to the eye sockets, use your scalpel to carefully cut through the thin membrane that connects the lids to the eyes.</p>
<p>You will need to keep the majority of the skull intact, to maintain a natural shape, but the soft tissue should all be removed: tongue, eyes, brain. Use caution so that when you cut out the tongue, you do not damage the hinges that connect the upper and lower maxilla.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The last time I stayed at my father’s house, he was living alone in a near-bare apartment outside of Alameda, near a marina. We ate out, because the only thing in his refrigerator was a whole roasted chicken from the grocery store. He lamented my inability to cook. He showed me his cupped palm, full of old wedding bands.  My mother’s was not there, he said, as he clamped his hand closed and carried them back to wherever they’d been hidden. Did he think I might have asked for it? It broke, he said, making a joke of it.</p>
<p>I awoke the next morning in his (only) bed with his arm around me. I spent the rest of the week on the living room floor without comment.</p>
<p>The specimen will be used for study, it isn’t intended to seem life-like—keep that in mind as you finish. After washing and drying the skin, you will use cotton wrapped around a small dowel to replace what you have extracted. Use enough cotton to create a sense of fullness, in the eye sockets, in the belly.</p>
<p>Tie the legs together, so they do not splay, and attach the specimen tag using a square knot. Paint the ends of the string with clear nail polish. Then close up the original incision.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>After college, after my own failed marriage, he regained an interest in me. I tried to be polite when he came to visit me in Washington DC. I met him downtown, but did not invite him to my house.</p>
<p>A few years later, one of his girlfriends called me to say he was depressed and would I please call back later to cheer him up? He’d mentioned her once. She had a little boy, he’d said, whose name was spelled &#8220;Jesus.&#8221;</p>
<p>“It’s pronounced ‘hey-Zeus’,” he’d said.<br />
I know, I thought.</p>
<p>He had told me her name, but I’d forgotten it and so had hung up on her the first time she called, thinking it was a wrong number. She spoke very little English. The conversation was frustrating for us both. I didn’t call back.</p>
<p>You may be tempted to take your needle and thread and sew dozens of the smallest stitches you can, as though attention to detail could hide the hole you’ve made. Resist this urge. Everyone expects a hole in an empty skin. Dip your needle once twice three times and then pull the thread tight. It’s enough.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>When I stopped answering his emails, he would telephone. The calls came every year or so, between girlfriends or wives. Once, late at night in a Barcelona train station, I was confused by the time difference and answered my cell phone, thinking there must be an emergency. He was bored and lonely. He made a joke about how long my master’s degree was taking.</p>
<p>When I stopped answering the phone, he started to text. He always tells me first, that he’s broke, and second, that he’s single.</p>
<p>Before you position the bird to be dried, stick one straight pin through the base of the bill vertically from bridge to chin. Thread a small piece of twine through the nostrils and around the bill, using the pin as an anchor to cinch it tightly closed.</p>
<p>Use as many pins as you need to hold the specimen in exactly the position you want on the board. The head should be facing forward or slightly up, the wings tightly folded, right leg over left, and tail feathers spread just to the width of the body. With proper preparation, it will keep this shape through decades of routine handling.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was born in 1981, my daddy wanted to give me the French name “Monique,” but he didn’t know how to spell it, and when he consulted with a nurse at the hospital there in our little town of Commerce, Georgia, she confessed she didn’t know how to spell it either. And so they guessed. The story of how I got my misspelled name is important to me because today I see my daddy’s ignorance on my birthday as a marker of the type of family I was born into: an uneducated one.</p>
<p>Neither of my parents finished high school. Momma left school when she was about nine years old and became a child laborer who picked cotton and worked on a chicken farm. Daddy made it as far as the eleventh grade. Unlike my parents, I was never forced to leave school or pick cotton.  And though I did not go to segregated schools like my parents did, I self-segregated myself from other people.</p>
<p>I think my language, my race, and my lower-class upbringing were the things that kept me apart from the kids at my school. Though I regularly spoke black vernacular at home with my parents and brother, at school my language was different. I learned early on that the world had a certain social order and particular language rules. One thing I learned was that Black English was to be spoken amongst black people who grew up in double-wide trailers like I did, and Standard English was to be used in education and the workforce. And while I learned all of this at an early age, my daddy never seemed to get it, or at least he pretended he didn’t.</p>
<p>“You talk so weird,” Daddy accused me. He stood in front of our kitchen door dressed in the green snowsuit that he wore as a uniform in the poultry plant where he worked. The suit had a few seams missing from wear and tear, and the bottom hem was frayed. “Half the time I don’t even know what you sayin’,” Daddy said, and as he pushed open the kitchen door and walked out into the black night I heard him grumble, “Hell, what chu think you is?”</p>
<p>Daddy’s intended meaning was clear: You are black just like I am, so why don’t you sound like it? I felt shamed by Daddy’s words, and what he said confirmed a suspicion I’d had for some time, which was that he thought I was talking down to him by speaking Standard English. Whenever we had those conversations about my speech, there was always a lot of eye-rolling and frustration on my part. I felt I should explain myself to Daddy, but what could I say? That his way of speaking wasn’t good enough for me anymore?  That I was ashamed to sound too black and too Southern? Instead of talking about it, I clammed up.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, Daddy liked to pretend my accent and diction had created a foreign language that he couldn’t comprehend. I think Daddy was just annoyed because I didn’t sound so much like him anymore. His theory was that I was “talking white” because I was influenced by the students at my predominately white school. This was not altogether true. The truth was that we lived in Jackson County, Georgia, a place where it was uncommon to hear Standard English, and nearly all of the kids at my school had a Southern accent. If I had truly planned to fit in with my classmates, I would have adopted a Southern twang, not an inclination toward standard speech. However, Daddy was right on one point— when I was younger, I used to speak vernacular with my family at home, but as I grew older my language changed. By the time I reached high school, my speech was much closer to a Standard American English dialect than anyone else’s in my family. I think the change in my speech was partly caused by the fact that I immersed myself in books. I was a lonely child, and reading books was one of few things that kept me from feeling so alone. Gradually, my Georgia drawl faded and I began to speak like the words on the page. And while my change in speech was partly brought about unconsciously, I can admit now that some of it was done purposefully. I knew how people degraded black speech and Southern speech, and I was afraid of sounding black and Southern.</p>
<p>At school, I felt alienated. While I did sometimes try to speak vernacular with the black students, some of those students judged me as not being ‘black’ enough. Karen did. She was a black girl in my grade who went to the same church as me.</p>
<p>“You a white girl trapped in a black girl’s body,” Karen said to me more than once.</p>
<p>At first I didn’t know what Karen meant, but then I noticed she usually accused me of being too white when she saw me off to myself reading a book or heard me use words longer than two syllables. I finally caught on that Karen associated reading books and using proper speech with being white. I never saw Karen read a thing, and her speech was far from what I would call proper. She had a distinctly black Southern style of speech, not the charming kind (à la Morgan Freeman), but the sort that made me want to get a set of earplugs. I could never admit to myself that I hated how she spoke—to hate it would be to hate a part of myself.</p>
<p>Karen and I could not be friends, and I think part of the reason was our different styles of speech. She was friends with the blacks who spoke like she did, and I think some of them considered me an uncle tom.</p>
<p>Aside from her accent, Karen’s behavior was also a big reason for our disconnect. After school, she’d go down to the east wing of our high school and have sex with boys in empty classrooms. I admired her, not for her cock-sucking, but because she did what she wanted and was unashamed of it. She seemed to enjoy what she did with those boys, and those boys loved it, so it was a win-win situation to me. While I admired Karen for her brazen boldness and authenticity, I was a virgin who was terrified of boys, even terrified of my own voice, and so I felt I couldn’t relate to her.</p>
<p>The qualities that I admired in Karen—confidence and genuineness—were the same qualities I admired in a lot of black people, especially the ones who spoke Black English. They had the attitude that they wouldn’t change for anyone else, and whenever I heard them speak I knew that they were simply being themselves, whether other people liked it or not. And while I admired the genuine style of black speech, I understood, even back then, that as a culture we shun Black English and accept the blacks who talk white. I cannot think of any powerful, well-respected blacks who speak Black Vernacular. Oprah Winfrey doesn’t. Barack Obama doesn’t. And if Oprah and Obama spoke like Karen, would they be in such powerful positions? Probably not.</p>
<p>In high school, my disconnect from Karen was representative of my disconnect from the other black students. Though I did speak vernacular with them, I suppose I didn’t do it well enough. Maybe I didn’t use enough double negatives. Maybe I couldn’t quite clip the ends of words like “door” and “store” crisply enough. I don’t know what the hell it was, but sometimes when I spoke to blacks, they would listen with their heads cocked to the side (the way a person might gape at something unusual). The strange looks they gave me were bad enough, but when those looks were mashed together with my shyness, it succeeded in crippling me. I rarely spoke unless spoken to, and even then my replies were tentative whispers. I started to hate my own voice.</p>
<p>As uncomfortable as I was with myself, I hated Ana’s voice even more. Ana was a Hispanic girl at my high school who tried to conceal her Mexican heritage. Though passing for white appeared to be her goal, her skin was too dark to be considered white, and so her attempts at passing were futile. Ana’s voice was so affected and high pitched and “valley girl” that even the white girls at our school would stare at her, and the few Mexican girls in our school wanted to kick Ana’s ass. I once asked two Mexican girls why they hated her so, and one of them responded with, “Because she say she is no Mexican.”</p>
<p>I had a Spanish class with Ana during my sophomore year. The other students in class asked her for help with homework and in-class assignments. Ana told them her Spanish was limited, and I think most people believed her until one day our Spanish teacher pronounced the word pharmacia (pharmacy) with the accent on the third syllable. Ana said, “I, like, heard that it’s, like, pronounced pharmacia (accent on second syllable). Like, I dunno, but that’s just, like, what I heard.”</p>
<p>The room went silent, and I felt the anger of about twenty students silently cursing Ana. I saw at least one pair of eyes roll. If Ana couldn’t help us with our homework because she didn’t speak Spanish, then how could she correct our teacher?</p>
<p>Ana and I were never friends, and so why do I care, even now as a grown woman, that she denied her heritage? I think it’s because I understand what it’s like to speak one way at home and a different way at school, and I sometimes wonder if other black people talk about me the way the Hispanic kids from my school talked about Ana. Am I trying too hard to assimilate? It’s a question I ask myself all the time. I examine my habits and all of my likes and dislikes for signs of too much milk in my bloodstream. My love of country music (Randy Travis, Dixie Chicks, Tim McGraw) counts as one point for the white team, but on the other hand I also like Sam Cooke, so that’s a point for the black team, right? Growing up, I was a fan of Kate Hepburn and black and white movies in general, and I see that as a point for the white team. And what about the books I’m reading? I’m a fan of Mildred D. Taylor and Roxane Gay (both black), but I definitely read more white writers than black. I blame my predominately white reading list on American schools. I cut my eyeteeth on the Western canon, but if I hadn’t been assigned so many Western writers in school, I doubt that I would read the canon as often as I do.</p>
<p>Not only was I fed a diet of mostly white writers in both high school and college, but I also grew up in a predominately white town, which whitewashed me even more since most of the kids I interacted with were white. By the unwritten social order rules, I could possibly have been friends with the poor whites since I was poor. I did have some casual friends from that group. I remember I went home with one of them to spend the night. Her name was Beth and she had a Southern accent typical of our region. She lived in a high-ceilinged house out in Madison County. A fat cat lazed around on Beth’s bed, and as we talked in her bedroom, Beth revealed a secret to me.</p>
<p>“I’m glad my daddy’s not home. I don’t know if he would allow you to spend the night here with us,” Beth said.</p>
<p>I wondered why not.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t really allow black people in our house,” Beth said. Her voice wasn’t hateful, just matter-of-fact.</p>
<p>That conversation marked the end of our friendship, and it was an awakening at the time. I was about seventeen that year, and I realized I had spent my time in grades K-12 ticking people off my list. I severed my relationships with black kids who spoke different from me and minority kids who acted “too white,” and the white kids who came from racist families. The thing about writing people off is that soon you look around and there’s no one there, no one to befriend.</p>
<p>During this friend crisis of mine, our household was the pity of my momma’s side of our family. Not that our extended family had much of a pot to piss in either, but my momma, my daddy, my brother and I were the most pathetic of us all. Our financial problems were worsened by the fact that my daddy loved his whiskey. More than once during my childhood, he had to be admitted into inpatient programs for substance abuse, which kept him out of work and caused Momma to struggle even harder to pay our bills. Momma often had to borrow money from her brothers and sisters just so we could afford to live.</p>
<p>During this time, I was given a box of hand-me-down sweaters from one of my older cousins. My favorite one was beige wool, and it had multi-colored argyle shapes across the front. I wore it often, and I was complimented on it. In my Advanced Placement (AP) English class, my sweaters were as nice as anything worn by my white, middle-class peers. I remember that my classmate Emma once said, “You have the nicest sweaters.” She was right. They looked and felt expensive.</p>
<p>One day, my black friend LaTonya was sitting near Emma and me in class. Emma made some comment about LaTonya being ‘ghetto’ or ‘hood’ or some other term often used to describe low-class blacks. I remember looking at LaTonya and wondering what was low-class about her. The only things I could think of were her speech and style of dress. LaTonya spoke like Karen, only not so loud or aggressive. LaTonya was also a bisexual who liked to wear baggy, man-style jeans and oversize t-shirts with sneakers or boots. I knew that LaTonya’s daddy liked to drink, probably not as much as my daddy, but he drank just the same. LaTonya was black and grew up in a double-wide, just like me. The only difference between us was that I sounded like a middle-class white girl and wore argyle sweaters, and LaTonya spoke like what would usually be heard in either of our homes and dressed less sophisticated. As a result of mine and LaTonya’s differences in speech and dress, Emma was kind to me but not to LaTonya. It occurs to me now that for a long time middle-class people like Emma have mistakenly assumed I shared something in common with them: a middle-class lifestyle.</p>
<p>Emma, along with most of the students in my AP English class in high school, belonged to the middle class white group. I was like them in that we all enjoyed books and dramatic movies. Maybe I could’ve been friends with them. Those students were friendly with me, but over the years I began to write them off. Some of them tended to believe that the Western world was ‘right’ and everything else was inferior. I saw this whenever they made fun of speech that was different from theirs. Most of them spoke Standard English. Very few had a Southern accent. Sometimes I wondered what they would say about my family if they heard my momma or daddy speak.</p>
<p>Another reason I felt distanced from my AP classmates was that I was dealing with poverty and my daddy’s drinking, so their concerns about prom and their detailed stories about their cats rarely interested me. I wrote them off based on the simple assumption that they were not poor and therefore could not understand me. Maybe I was wrong. Maybe they had alcoholic daddies like mine, or maybe their home lives were similar to mine in some way or another. All I know for sure is that as a teenager I didn’t think anyone in the world was suffering like I was. And when I thought about reaching out to the students in my AP class, I tried to picture a girl like Emma hanging out with me at our trailer—a place with holes in the floors that was heated by only a kerosene space heater in winter—and I couldn’t.</p>
<p>In an earlier draft of this essay, I wrote that I’m not so sure if I can be friends with middle-class whites. One of my friends, a girl who is both white and middle-class, read the essay and said that I should retract that statement. But I won’t take it back. I can’t. For a long time, I have reflected on what could possibly lead me to make such a racist, classist statement. Over time, I have come to realize that my insecurities around middle class whites comes from my resentment of social classes. I see my status as one that has been constantly marginalized. And there, sitting on the other end of the social spectrum, is the mainstream group, which I think is made up of middle and upper class whites. Even today, whenever I am in a room full of people, I am still very conscious of where I come from—the wrong side of that spectrum—and it makes me angry and bitter. Sure, I’ve had middle-class white friends before, but I have always kept them at a distance. I am a product of the environment in which I grew up. I don’t know that anyone can come through the type of poverty I grew up in and survive it completely unscathed and with no anger or meanness or resentfulness. Today, I can say that perhaps my paranoia around middle-class white people stems from being raised in a society where being poor is a source of shame. I think somewhere in the midst of my lower-class suffering, I began to unjustly blame the middle and upper classes. I can’t be friends with people who come from wealthier backgrounds because deep down I worry they will make judgments about me based on where I come from. Several times I’ve heard people use words like “trailer trash” to describe people like me. They used these classist, hateful labels in a way that was directed at other people, and they said it to me as if they thought I would understand, as if they assumed I grew up in a nice home like they did and would somehow agree that to come from a trailer makes someone less of a human being. This is not to say that all middle-class white people have this type of attitude toward the poor. In fact, I’m sure that many do not. And yet, my fear of the middle class and my insecurities around them are very real.<br />

As an undergrad I took a course called American Speech, and it is one of the few classes I remember from all of my years in school. The class introduced me to the concept of language prejudice, which is basically the idea that we are all pre-judged based on the way we speak. I had been aware of that type of prejudice since I was younger, but I didn’t know the name for it, nor did I know that there was so much to be learned about language. It was mind-blowing.</p>
<p>My teacher spoke with an Appalachian accent. He was from North Carolina and admitted that when he first came into the academic world he was ashamed of his speech. I understood him completely. I was a child who felt I should conceal my family life from other students, even adopt a different way of speaking to keep them from knowing about the world I grew up in.</p>
<p>One of the most important things I learned in speech class is that there are no ‘good’ or ‘bad’ dialects, just different ones. Language is completely arbitrary. The accents we develop are all due to where and how we were raised and conditioned. Accents do not reflect our level of intelligence. Being born Southern or black doesn’t make a person stupid or less of a person.</p>
<p>Even after my newfound reassurance that my language was nothing to be ashamed of, I confess I am still sometimes self-conscious about the way I speak. When I decided to apply to graduate school in English, I worried that my language wouldn’t be good enough to compete or even stay on the same level as the other students. I was educated by parents who had only the bare minimum of education themselves, and since my education could not begin at home, I depended heavily on my school to educate me. But my high school was a public school in rural Georgia. The South is notorious for having school systems that are admittedly behind the rest of the country. My school was no different. We had low test scores, and no one tried to set the standard any higher for us.</p>
<p>For a long time I didn’t think I belonged in classrooms, and even now I am unsure if I do. Aside from my worries about language, I am also a person who likes to form my own opinions about things, and I sometimes think classrooms basically teach everyone to think alike. Right now I’m in graduate school, a place where some students elevate their teachers to god-like entities and try to express the same thoughts and feelings as their teachers. All of my classmates pretty much speak Standard English and everyone is politically correct. The vernacular I spoke with my family when I was younger is probably as foreign in our program as, well, students who are only one generation from cotton pickers. Sometimes I long to hear a strong regional accent in our cohort, and I wish my classmates would argue instead of always agreeing on the big issues concerning race and class and sexuality. I wish that more students in our academic program could be as genuine and unpretentious as my high school classmate Karen.</p>
<p>Right now I work as a tutor in our college’s writing center. I have tutored essays written by Southern kids and minority kids, and even when the content of their papers is good, I sometimes worry about their grades suffering because of their grammar and vernacular. A black boy whose paper was infused with Black Vernacular once came in for help. I stumbled through his paper, all the while tempted to tell him to think about how his white teacher would say things and then re-write it accordingly. Whenever I tutor those types of papers, I feel like I’m acting superior, like I’m climbing up into my ivory white tower and pulling out my little red pen and scratching the words “Whiten up,” across the tops of the students’ papers.</p>
<p>Some of you might argue that students should whiten up, that Standard English is more eloquent and better overall than other varieties of the language. But would you think that way if you weren’t taught to think so in classrooms? What if all of your teachers spoke with heavy Boston accents? What if all of your textbooks were written in the Boston dialect? What if every time you turned on the TV the newscaster dropped every other ‘R’? Would you still think that Standard English is superior to the Boston dialect? Probably not.<br />
*<br />
When I was accepted to two graduate-level English programs, I gained a little confidence. I thought that perhaps I was good enough—that my language and writing skills were good enough—to move and learn in academic circles. But during the first week of classes, my old worries surfaced again. In a writing workshop, a professor posed a question: Who are your biggest writing influences? I named Anne Rivers Siddons and Mildred D. Taylor, two authors that the professor had never heard of. I explained that Taylor has written several kids’ books I admire and that Siddons writes women’s commercial fiction. The professor gave me a blank look and explained that if I planned to write “up here” (raises his hand above his head), then I should read “up here” (keeps his hand up as though he’s trying to touch God).</p>
<p>I wondered which books I’d most likely find on this professor’s shelf. Probably Hemingway and Proust, I thought, and so I wasn’t surprised when Mr. Write-Up-Here asked if any of us had read any Proust. I was annoyed. If I can mentally go through a list of what a college professor might consider “writing up here,” then there is something wrong with our education system—that many academics think learning to write should involve stumbling around reading the same books. While I never expected to be assigned commercial writers like Siddons in my MFA classes, I didn’t expect my professors to treat me with condescension either. My problem with the professor’s ‘write up here’ comment (aside from the fact that it was laced with condescension) is that he didn’t stop to ask what I admire about Siddons and Taylor before writing them off as kids’ stuff. If he had asked, I would have assuredly told him that Taylor, while classified as a children’s author, is someone who writes about race in a bold way. She’s completely uninhibited, which is what I want to be. And while I don’t always admire the content of Siddons’ novels, I do admire her style. She writes Southern fiction (which I aspire to write), is great with characterization and setting, and I always learn new words from her, not to mention that her prose is often like poetry.</p>
<p>My write-up-here professor loves his Western writers, and while I certainly enjoy reading many white writers, I still have a problem with teachers who can only give me white writers as examples of what I should aspire to. As a minority writer, I feel that teachers like him feed a concern I’ve had for a while now—that no matter how much I improve as a writer I’ll never be considered “up here” simply because I’m not white.</p>
<p>I think one of the things that bugs me most about being told to write up here/get sophisticated is that I know I am not sophisticated and I never will be. I have known this for a very long time. I am a country woman who walks barefoot, loves anything fried, and enjoys reading and writing accessible prose and poetry.<br />

Recently, I read a writer’s forum post where a student writer criticized the black novelist Jamaica Kincaid. He said that Kincaid is from “some country that’s probably a good place to test an A-bomb.” And when I read his comment, it confirmed an idea I had had about American schools for some time—that by focusing on white culture and white writers, we are placing value judgments on countries like Antigua (Kincaid’s homeland). By focusing on Eurocentric literature, we teach students that literature from places like U.S.A., England and France is the only literature worth reading. The result of all of this—reading mostly white authors and being graded by a white standard of speech—is that I believe for a long time I was taught in schools that white people are superior to me. One of my graduate school classmates says this isn’t true, that American students aren’t universally taught that whites are superior. My best response to this is that I am not white or middle-class or from the Midwest, but I had better speak as if I am in order to be taken seriously in a classroom. American schools have taught me that my language is inferior, and language is everything to an aspiring writer.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Way In, 2012</p>
<p>I’m not ready to watch my father’s first movie alone. In it, a boy regularly burned by his sadistic mother grows up and finds her dead in the house they still share, freeing him to indulge his homicidal pyromania with fresh female victims. Instead of looking closer at my father’s story, instead of settling into a dark room with this small piece of him, instead of committing myself to his visions scene by scene, I watch Quentin Tarantino introduce the film at the 2006 Best of the QT Film Festival on YouTube. He stands on a small stage lit by a projector in Austin, Texas, welcoming the audience, and me.</p>
<p>Unlike Tarantino, my father never wanted me to watch <i>Keep Out*</i>. He never sent me a VHS though I asked more than twice. Claiming embarrassment, his shame show whiffed of something more. “Just please don’t watch it until I’m dead,” he said.</p>
<p>My father never swung a plastic cup or slurred his words, which Tarantino does in the YouTube video. My father drank his last beer and directed his last film before I was born. Though I have no proof, I imagine the booze fed the art, and when both were gone, I proudly accepted the position of his next great love (after the booze) and creation (after the movie). I took my place on the stage in our home as a wavy-haired, wide-eyed emblem of all that he believed good in the world: I was steadfast, loyal, true. I tried to believe, as he tried new experiments with different careers and as our family took its dips and turns, that I could be these things for him always.</p>
<p>Tarantino announces the line-up at the all-night horror movie marathon, a streaming roll of cheap gore, his ‘80’s cult favorites selected from the years since the festival’s beginning in 1997. <i>Keep Out*</i> was projected on 16mm at the first QT Fest: Tarantino once cooed to my father that he owned a copy when they met in the lobby of the Arclight Cinema on Sunset Boulevard in 2009. According to a half-smug, half-flattered recounting from my father, patrons gathered around the two directors to watch them profess their mutual fandom before the next showing of <i>Inglorious Basterds</i>, which my father was going to see for the first time while Tarantino came to observe the audience. They stood in front of the waxed ticket booth and the adjacent minishop that sells film stars’ photographic autobiographies and the newest trend in key chains for Angelino drivers. The marquee opens like a menu above the booth, selections lit up like ticker tape, an oversized analog clock without numbers centered at the top warning latecomers that they will be turned away, reserved seats and sixteen-dollar tickets or no. Beyond the gourmet concession stands selling Columbian coffee and organic chocolate along with the usual fare, the cinemas are enormous caves, the round walls planted with tiny bulbs blinking like distant stars. The screens are wide just like the plump blue velvet seats, and ushers introduce the films before they play. Directors are bound to run into each other in such a place, but I always preferred the defunct Fairfax Avenue theatre’s creaky fold-down chairs, sticky floors, and one-dollar specials on weekday afternoons. The last movie I saw before they bolted the doors forever was Sarah Silverman’s <i>Jesus is Magic</i>.</p>
<p>I am a fan of Tarantino. Tarantino is <i>a fan</i> of my father, and this means something to me, but it doesn’t help me know what I am to my father: beloved, a prize, a member of his clan, a devotee, a piece of him.</p>
<p>“Love you,” I say into a receiver.</p>
<p>“Take care,” he replies.</p>
<p>I’m sure—<i>sure</i>—there is some secret at the core of his movie that will show me who my father is, how I can learn to be a recognized artist—possess a fan base (however small), garner success at the bank (second at the box office opening weekend to <i>Friday the 13<sup>th</sup></i>), publicly admired by at least one genius in his field. If I look close enough at his movie, I will understand him (I won’t): his ultimate limitations as a filmmaker, as a man, as a father. If I can understand his film, I’ll learn what drove him to drink, to make this movie, to make me. I’ll identify what darkness is only his and not at all mine to inherit (a day will never pass when I won’t have to decide this piece by piece, or decide not to decide). I can set myself free.</p>
<p>To get free from so many questions, to search for answers, I go to the place that has always given the desert Los Angeles wasteland where I grew up color and meaning. The place that told me about all the characters there are to be: the television afterschool, the movies, the computer for research or to write. Like all of us, I go to screens.</p>
<p>Tarantino barks from the video to “shut the fuck up” while the movies are playing.</p>
<p>“This is not an it’s-so-bad-it’s-good festival.… we’re gonna give [the films] <i>res</i>PECT,” he says, leaning forward and practically spitting into the audience.</p>
<p>The demand for respect delivered in an entirely disrespectful manner is all too familiar: hypocrisy is second nature to a man with a drink in his hand. Not that I should know because I never saw my father that way. But sometimes even if the drink is gone, the drunk isn’t. So I know anyway.</p>
<p>My father decides to burn women—their nails painted and hair done, writhing with feminine virility and completely naked—with a torch blower in the basement of a decrepit New Jersey mansion. Or, his film’s protagonist, Donnie does.</p>
<p>I open a scanned photograph he has sent me of himself as a twenty-something in black-and-white. “AN ANGRY YOUNG MAN,” my father titles it in all caps, and I compare a still shot of Donnie, played by a young Italian-American actor whom I know from <i>The Sopranos</i>—a show we watched together in the living room with bowls of vanilla Haagen Daas and Hershey’s syrup. Side by side, the images double on my laptop screen: curly brown hair, narrow eyes, a square face, a big nose, and thin lips shut tight. I assure myself that my father is more handsome than Donnie.</p>
<p>My father and I share a broad face and wide nose.</p>
<p>I have been a mirror.</p>
<p>My reflection in the dressing room at a Versace outlet store: I carefully slide myself into a black silk satin pantsuit my father has picked out for me to try on. I am seventeen, just old enough to carry the outfit if I stand still, statuesque, and wear stilettos. When I step out to the main room with its shiny white linoleum floors, my father is across from me speechless at the sheen of the suit, and I remember another photograph of him and my mother in the back of a black limousine on their way to the premiere of his movie. In this suit, I could be in the backseat with them, all glitter and glam. “You have to have it,” he says, and though I’m not sure because I have no reason to own anything made of Italian silk satin at seventeen, I say okay. I am a dream in this suit; I am my father’s dream in this suit; my father loves me in this suit.</p>
<p>“Why are you digging into this crap,” he says into the phone from Los Angeles when I ask about his past. “What makes us who we are?” he says.</p>
<p>“No less is this the best of QT…” Tarantino says into the mic smirking and with proper Hollywood pomp, “…these are the <i>stars</i> of the marathon class.”</p>
<p>Enthusiastic but thin applause claps against the theatre walls. I keep watching, the answer to my father’s questions rising like my face from his.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Home Screening, 2011</p>
<p>The first time I watch <i>Keep Out*</i>, a couple of friends join me at my boyfriend’s place, one of them a trashy-slasher aficionado. We rent it on DVD from the independently-owned rental treasure trove on Main Street in the small Northwest college town where I’m living—I can’t believe they have a copy.</p>
<p>“They had it?” my aficionado-friend says on his way in, eight inches taller than me, eyebrows raised, and carrying a case of beer and a bottle of whiskey. My father’s movie was shelved next to the good stuff the big screens in town won’t play. Pride stirs a rock in my diaphragm, then small panic: it’s as if I’ve stolen something, but I paid $2.50 to have the DVD for a week. The smell of beer is on my friend’s breath, his mouth agape in front of me, and I wonder if $2.50 is enough to buy my way into my father’s imagination. Does this buy my father’s permission?</p>
<p>We settle into the couch, beer and whiskey at our feet, and play the movie on a flat screen. These other eyes combined with my boyfriend’s frequent trips to the bathroom are distracting: I can’t hear or see my father. I realize I’ve invited them because I couldn’t face this alone. I needed these men in the room to drown him out, still fearful (though entirely unaware of it) that his demons will claim me once and for all. The full implications are lost—why angle the camera that way, why from that corner, why costume the first victim in brown (my father has always hated brown clothing). With each frame, I yearn more and more for privacy. I want to consider every choice made on set and in the cutting room just a few years before my mother and father chose to have me, but instead of time to do it, there’s company.</p>
<p>I sip slowly on a single can of PBR and fear holds me still in my seat: could this slasher-savvy friend of mine see more into my father’s psyche than I can? Can he, fueled by beer and whiskey, see what Tarantino sees? I wonder if drinking is the secret.</p>
<p>Months later, I work up the courage to get drunk and cue up the movie my father said he made “so that [he] could make the movies [he] really wanted to make.” But he never made those movies. He made this one.</p>
<p>The images that by sober daylight are cheaply produced and somewhat disturbing, become haunting while I am drunk and alone in my apartment at night. I lean sloppily at my desk after only three beers and become easily spooked at the cheap scares. How much of Donnie is my father’s recreation of himself?</p>
<p>He is dreaming: at the beach it is dusk and his hair, thick and dark like my father’s, blows in sea air. Explosions light up the dark surrounding Donnie as he watches fire blaze paths through the sand. One path cools to reveal a deep hole left behind: a hole my parents dug together at the Jersey shore. A synthetic xylophone plops and hums and reverbs like a blown speaker. Donnie stands at the edge and looks down, a close up of his eyes backlit by the horizon twilight, his brow creased in tension just like my father’s. A shot of the hole: the bottom is too dark to see. Atonal sounds settle with a wide shot of Donnie from below. A pull in tighter on his face. He realizes there is something in the hole. A synthetic alarm sounds. Three burnt bodies jump and grab Donnie by the ankles. The burned women pull him down. He claws at the sand.</p>
<p>I stop the movie.</p>
<p>Instead, I look at stills—Donnie’s blank face on the beach just like my father’s in Santa Monica, the naked redhead with pale skin like mine chained up and screaming, the fire of the torch in the steel basement. What have I been a victim of? Or am I a martyr? What do I believe?</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The Mall, 1991</p>
<p>On Thursdays after school, my father picks me up and we go to a movie. The day is better because I won’t walk home like all the other kids, rolling a house key between my fingers, or land on our white couch to stay for many hours in front of the television. While that time alone with the small screen is sacred, the thrill of walking out the chainlink fence from the schoolyard and into my father’s fourth-hand forest green BMW, tan leather seats hot on my thighs and the air conditioning on high, makes me forget the daily monotony. He has released me from homework, dirty dishes, drudgery—and we roll west to my favorite mall.</p>
<p>The Westside Pavillion has pink and turquoise trim with skylights and steep escalators; it is where Tom Petty shot the music video for his song “Free Fallin.’” I’m embarrassed when I hear it—“she’s a good girl… loves horses… crazy ‘bout Elvis….” I’m a character, summarizable by a pop song. Home from a riding lesson in the valley one day, I find pictures of my father as a boy in a kitchen drawer. “He looks like Elvis!” I burst out to no one in particular.</p>
<p>We buy candy and sit next to each other in the cool dark. The erratic action and white noise of normal life fades and we enter a world of contrasted color and shadow, precisely timed soundtracks, and iconic faces acting life out as it is when we make a story of it. I sink myself in stories; my father has always read to me before bed. This to me is what I imagine booze was to him, a safe and warm escape where I can dream myself as big as the faces on-screen. He gives this to me. I can be anything in a dark theatre.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p><i>The Nasties</i>, 2010</p>
<p>Glen Criddle has an exploitation film review called <i>The Nasties</i> on YouTube, and he covered <i>Keep Out*</i>.</p>
<p>“Donnie picks his victims to have a mirror for both his hatred of women and himself… [yet] the killer’s motives are basic and unexplored.”</p>
<p>As a kid, I saw stills of the first murder scene in the movie hung on the wall of my father’s office. That scene is what I wait to see and it is what I fear witnessing the most: it is my father’s magnum opus as a filmmaker.</p>
<p>My father’s first victim in the film was a Playboy model and friend of my mother’s. It was a closed set. Completely naked, her wrists chained above her, she is doused with gasoline from a red five-gallon canister by Donnie’s hand. In a blue room of steel-plated walls, the gas pours into her mouth as she screams. Flame shoots at her with a pull of Donnie’s finger. The color and field of view is the most beautiful: I can’t look away.</p>
<p>Criddle is right. Donnie’s motives are unclear, but my father’s are not: this scene is worth watching again and again.</p>
<p>Criddle says, “There is some complexity to this broken man…despite the disjointed way it’s presented to us.”</p>
<p>I learn that there are several cuts to the film, one for each release in the United States, in the UK, in Europe. I learn that many exploitation films from the 1970s and ‘80s had multiple cuts and I wonder about the stories those directors meant to tell versus the ones movie studios would allow. I learn that many writers and directors of exploitation films are sickened by their work, despite positive reviews or box office success.</p>
<p>My father, to me: “I did what I could with what I had.”</p>
<p>Enter envy here: my father defends himself, even I defend him, but I agree with the critic before a single word of my own colors a page. My critic leaps from a pit in the brain. I walk up, like Donnie on the beach, looking for a reason to bury my story, myself in the sand.</p>
<p>Sometimes it takes me, but I get a grip on something solid and pull myself back to the white screen and blinking cursor.</p>
<p>What is it jumping out at my father? Is it so different from what is clutching at my ankles? Is my father only better at pretending it isn’t there, at walking with the weight? OR: Is it all mere costumes and lighting—do we create our own nightmares?</p>
<p>Criddle: “It should have at least something going on below the surface to convey some reason for [its] bleakness.”</p>
<p>The bleakness I know: the white of our couch afterschool, of city noise in the wee hours, of a blank page. Wide streets of Vine and Highland and Sunset running alongside movie studios and homeless shelters and mini malls. The Santa Monica Pier stretched across the pale beach into the Pacific, Ferris wheel spinning and sparkling to me. The hills rolling in and out of the valley, grown over in desert greenery crackling under the sun. I’ve never seen those leaves go dark except by wild fire, sometimes a match burned black deep within the branches and ash, smoke billowing over the city.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Family Fire, 1995</p>
<p>In our bedroom, my little sister, seven years old, screams and cries in her bed and my father stands over her yelling. I tell him, “Stop it, stop,” but he won’t hear me from just four feet away, so I say it again, loud, STOP IT, and before the two syllables are out, he spins around, his hand held above me, muscles flexed and taut. I scoot back quick and fold my eleven-year-old body into the corner of my twin bed where the walls meet. I wait, every joint locked, the room quiet but for the sound of blood pulsing through my temples. His anger is suspended above me, all its weight wanting to fall, and I fear more than anything that he’ll hit me anyway, after this time to think about it; after we’ve been face-to-face, me cowering in the corner, eyes begging him still to stop; after the adrenaline has settled some, leaving the nerves vulnerable. It will hurt more if he hits me now; more will be broken this way.</p>
<p>Instead: he laughs.  Lowering his hand, he smiles at me, as if it were all a joke. From below, his white teeth gleam with saliva and his broken eye contact is a confession of what he knows: his power over me is absolute. On his side, I am safe; on my own, I am vulnerable to everything, especially him. I feel sure he is laughing at my smallness, at my being eleven and unable to stop him. I feel as though he laughs because to hit me would be too easy, and so, unfulfilling. I feel as though he sees all the weakness I cannot change, and is amused.</p>
<p>My bones rattle, teeth clattering in my skull.</p>
<p>“You <i>ass</i>hole,” I say, just like I’ve heard my mother say so many times. His face drops and all is perfectly quiet. “You <i>fuck</i>ing asshole.” I say it again and again and it is as though the oldest thing I know is speaking for me.</p>
<p>His face darkens and he becomes so still; I’ve never spoken to him like this and now it’s me that won’t stop. My relentlessness awakens him, his muscles making the smallest movement so that I’m sure he’s beginning to grow in front of me. I run out of the room, down the stairs, out the back door. When I return from the sandbox and swings hours later, it’s dinnertime and we take our places around the rectangular glass table. I sit at my end, across from him.</p>
<p>“You have to apologize,” my mother says.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” I say.</p>
<p>“Like you mean it, Katie,” she says.</p>
<p>My father is stone-faced and doesn’t look at me. I wait for him to raise his eyes, to make his own admission, apology. I do what my mother says.</p>
<p>“And you’ll never disrespect him again,” she demands. I feel the heat from the spotlight lamp hanging over the table, its reflection on the glass an electric stovetop for my boiling gut.</p>
<p>In a flashback, Donnie’s mother holds his arms over a gas flame to punish him.</p>
<p>For a year or two afterward, I say as little to my father as possible. One morning, we go for a drive downtown away from the ocean and he says, “I couldn’t believe how scared you looked when I raised my hand. I laughed because I couldn’t believe what I was doing. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Between the times my father and I step out the front door and back inside again, we begin to talk about nothing in particular.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Riding Waves, 2002</p>
<p>“I don’t love you anymore,” my scrawny high school boyfriend says at twilight a few months before I leave Los Angeles for college. I roll home under a purple sky in the silver pick up truck my father bought me fighting back tears that won’t stop coming. My father sees me come in the back door and already knows. The next day, he and I go for a drive, and he puts on an Emmy Lou Harris record in his black truck so I can just let the tears fall. He owned a black pick up truck twenty years ago; Donnie drove young women to the New Jersey mansion in it.</p>
<p>That night, I see a late show of <i>Whale Rider</i>, the first movie I watch in a theatre alone. I will go to the movies alone whenever I need to be someone else. In a familiar dark room, the story of a young girl stepping into a man’s role as leader of her tribe is backdrop for the ocean at daybreak and the underwater shots of the girl gripping the back of a baleen whale. I ride home from the movie in the silver pick up, street lights glinting off my windshield, and decide to drive to the beach early the next morning. When I sleep, I sink into water, dreaming of an ocean cliff, and rise before dawn to meet surfers bobbing like seals in the breakers. It is cold, the cab of the truck like a womb. The hood reflects the smoky blue of the sky and sea, fog clouding any light from the sun. On the slate horizon, I see the orange balloon my father tied to the driver’s side mirror before he led me, hand over my eyes, to my truck and I got in for the first time. “My baby ocean” he always says when we drive along the coast, and looks with a slight longing at the surfers below. I will be gone soon into my own story, but the waves hush memory and imagination, rolling one over another, over another. The hair on my arms bristles under a gray sweatshirt; the cold gets in. I stay, a chill creeping into my bones, and imagine my laughter mixing with the surfers’ playful calls, the icy water crashing with our voices.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>They are living in the Dead Cities of Syria. In Serjilla, amid the abandoned ruins of ancient Roman villas, refugees now shelter from war. I saw this in a news video, recognized the place where, a few years ago, I took a happy tourist stroll.</p>
<p>The reporter crouches beside a wall of stone as shells explode above him. Below, in rooms where animals once lived, families huddle. The camera pans the faces of children. Their eyes stare with naked blankness. A woman squats beside a fire: &#8220;What am I, a terrorist? What&#8217;s my little child, a terrorist?&#8221; she asks through the translator. The camera finds another woman as she thumbs away tears.</p>
<p>Serjilla is a few miles off the road from Hama to Aleppo. It is among hundreds of Byzantine ruins clustered in northern Syria, named &#8220;dead cities&#8221; by some early European explorers. But these sites were less cities than large villages that thrived for five centuries on agriculture: olives, olive oil, wine, wheat, grapes. Then climate changed. Drought and rising temperatures rendered land unproductive. Bubonic plague struck. There were Persian invasions. In 550 AD, after centuries of prosperity, the villages began to decline.</p>
<p>The day I stopped, in November 2010, I was with my husband, David, and the driver we had hired, a man from Aleppo named Abed. We sought Serjilla from the guidebook&#8217;s description as &#8220;&#8230; the most eerie and evocative of the Dead Cities.&#8221; And indeed the site was a vast scatter of crumbling structures with empty windows and doorways like dark eyes in the sides of stone buildings. The triangular ends of pitched roofs—with no roof—pricked skyward. Facades were softened by the rounded shapes of arches and columns. All was cut from the limestone massif of northern Syria, white blocks now corroded, stained a rusty orange from the slow burn of oxidation, stained black from the spread of fungus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within the neighborhood of memories that are journeys, I have a house that is Syria. I began the building before I left home: I read guidebooks, made reservations, got visas. Then I crossed the Lebanese border at Aboudieh with <i>Syrian Arab Republic</i> stamped in my passport. I gathered furnishings from the corpus of sensations that swelled with the traveling: the tastes of fresh pomegranate juice and sweet black tea; the sights of Crusader castles, of sidewalk markets with abundant mounds of tomatoes and green onions, tangerines and oranges, bunches of parsley and mint; the hospitality of a Bedouin woman who served us tea in her tent in the desert outside Palmyra.</p>
<p>My photos and journals, the blue silk scarf with the pistachio pattern that I bought at the old souk in Aleppo, these are among the souvenirs that keep Syria vivid for me. <i>Souvenir.</i> In French it means to remember, is rooted in latin for <i>subvenire</i>, to come up, come to mind.</p>
<p>I think back to the Bedouin woman who invited us into her family tent near the spot in the road where we stopped to let a herd of camels cross. I remember how the woman welcomed us with a wide and luminous smile, how she wore black robes and a red-and-white-checked headscarf, how we sat on carpets as we waited for the sugar and tea to steep in the stainless steel kettle, how we held the hot edges of small glasses to sip the tea, how the nearly blind grandmother who sat in a plastic chair near the tent door held up her hands for me to see her marriage tattoos, how Abed and the woman laughed as if we were silly when we offered to pay, how the woman and I leaned toward each other as David took a photograph.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I square today&#8217;s news with the sweet souvenirs of my journey? How can anyone I met, any kind stranger, be unchanged by the destruction that has descended on Syria? Because I was there, because I ask these questions, I listen. I watch. I read. I recognize: the old souk in Aleppo, now mostly destroyed; the grand Roman ruins of Palmyra, now shelled, the museum looted. And then there are the bodies: shot in the head, hands bound, pulled from the Orontes River near Hama. The dead and wounded scattered outside bakeries where the hungry had queued. The gassed children wrapped in shrouds.</p>
<p>Some of the living are sheltering in Serjilla. And my abode of memory is draped with the dark dust of sorrow.</p>
