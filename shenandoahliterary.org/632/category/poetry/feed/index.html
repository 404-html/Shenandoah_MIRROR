								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8212; for Ivonne, five years post-cancer</p>
<p>The sternum’s gladiolus (L: small sword) bisects<br />
the chest cavity coronally where the wan<br />
blood&#8217;s re-oxygenated just beneath your sweater&#8217;s V,<br />
the monotonous muscle squeezing out its tattoo,<br />
as it must in order to square<br />
things with the lungs, the cells&#8230;. And yet, the weathered</p>
<p>heart pumps, we’re nearly certain, some special ethered<br />
serum through the works, Eros launching a dart at one sex<br />
or the other – (bead straight, conclusion fore-<br />
gone, a magician’s wand)<br />
and the clock-work lub and dub’ll<br />
swell to the chords of a Beethoven’s Fifth</p>
<p>once rightly agitated, years of pent<br />
up stuff outing like a split atom. They&#8217;re heard,<br />
though each throb’s a batter at the walls, reminders of debil-<br />
ities to come, each a palpable denial of Berkley&#8217;s ghostly physics &#8212;<br />
&#8220;too subtle for the airiest human head,&#8221; says Byron in Don Juan<br />
and so patently absurd, Dr. Johnson, indignant, swung forth</p>
<p>his cocked, refuting foot with “mighty force”<br />
into a rock one Sunday outside church (if I’ve<br />
recalled the Life correctly). Yet neither could deny the onus<br />
the heart bears and I listen sometimes, try-<br />
ing to trace the thousand zigs<br />
and zags of its circuit, pulse bedevil-</p>
<p>ing my good sleep with a rising audible<br />
twanging like dots and dashes from some for-<br />
eign, occupied shore. Or, it’s simply mice – one seeks<br />
a way out, tap tapping behind the walls, his vague syncho-<br />
pations signaling the blind mouse behind whose own tapping treble<br />
and bass leads the next – as if all, at last, might stumble on some hard-won</p>
<p>explanation that lays out plainly for me, one<br />
unifying field accounting for two<br />
hemispheres of brain where dwells a three-<br />
personed (Harpo, Chico, Groucho?) god and four<br />
truths noble enough to focus all five<br />
senses, lit up like candles on day six,</p>
<p>so that I, even now, dulled and daily numb-<br />
er, grope still to decipher the infinite<br />
odds of my good luck, my fumbling digits touching, again, your horrible, miraculous scars.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An olive hue, too, says my wife. Close to sleep<br />
we&#8217;ve sailed, adrift and determined<br />
as Bligh himself, from Bounty to Christian</p>
<p>to Gauguin&#8217;s self-possessed women. Stars and moon<br />
and then a comet beyond our window, and I’m off<br />
on Haley&#8217;s (long A when I was a boy) breasting</p>
<p>the planets&#8217; cross-currents, swimming past Earth<br />
in 76-year circuits as on the birth and death of<br />
Mark Twain, a man who made his name a pun</p>
<p>and plumbed the depths of human folly, returning<br />
(the comet), a ball of ice and wedding-gown train<br />
of dust – pronounced, strangely now</p>
<p>in my middle age, to rhyme, short A, with valley<br />
– like Rudy? she mumbles back to me, who sang<br />
charming songs of love? or where we shall walk through,</p>
<p>fearing – should, like a silk hankie, our prayers touch lightly<br />
the brow of a pleased God – no evil? His songs (Vallee&#8217;s)<br />
were proclaimed through the large end of a cone</p>
<p>and my mind narrows to Roy Cohn, a small<br />
unhappy man, who’d made his name upon<br />
plucking from men and women – he loved</p>
<p>men and was angry – their own good names. But yes,<br />
a cone, a megaphone, making Vallee&#8217;s voice larger, bolder,<br />
just as a microscope once made, hidden from the eyes of men</p>
<p>and women, the tiny comets of protoplasm and spermatozoa<br />
grow large beneath the eyes, I tell her, of Anton van Leeuwenhoek,<br />
cloth merchant, who ground lenses to inspect the woof and warp</p>
<p>of his bolts (yards of lush embroidered fabric,<br />
not fire from an angry sky) adjusting left and right<br />
the glasses of his meticulous machine to observe</p>
<p>the busy lives of mites and cells in the Delft<br />
of 1670, the lens, beveled all around and lentil shaped<br />
from which its name was lent and … Forty days</p>
<p>of forsaken pleasures? or, like Polonius,<br />
that which should neither be borrowed nor….<br />
Poor Polonius, a parent, like ourselves, given to giving</p>
<p>parental advice, even if poorly, that his children&#8217;s poor choices<br />
may not one day come crashing fierily about their shoulders<br />
or, bacteria-like, wheedle invisibly beneath the skin</p>
<p>to blossom on the forehead in fever. Polonius<br />
in unhappy Elsinore could not ascribe such heartache<br />
to microbes, their troubles – fathers and children –</p>
<p>came large – stabbed and poisoned and, when ground between<br />
a thoughtless boyfriend and thoughtless father,<br />
drowned. They fuck you up your mum and dad, your kids,</p>
<p>your equivocating sweetheart who, finally, at Elsinore,<br />
was himself Xed out like girlfriend and mother who possessed<br />
the two XXes that attach men to women, winsome Ophelia</p>
<p>longing all the while for something beyond<br />
her reach, unable to attach her suspecting suitor<br />
to herself with a lust sufficient by the 20th century</p>
<p>to warrant three bold marquee XXXes and which blossoms freely<br />
in the bonobo, our near genetic twins, separated princes<br />
and paupers, who tap out on their computers</p>
<p>simple picture-sentences: “I am hungry.”<br />
“Where is my toy?” when not engaged in exuberant,<br />
dyad, triad, and group monkey sex (don&#8217;t, she says,</p>
<p>get any ideas) and who, given enough typewriters,<br />
might, fingers rough on the keyboard buttons,<br />
sign their letters with four sincere XXXXes</p>
<p>to convey simply, wondrously, their heart’s<br />
most wild affection for girlfriend and beau<br />
…from which Cupid shoots his Eros? Straight</p>
<p>through our excess? our cupidity? hitting the mark<br />
marking the spot, finding the there there<br />
we’d always hoped was there, making it glow brighter</p>
<p>than Haley&#8217;s, than Halley&#8217;s, no larger than an apple<br />
in the outstretched palm of our brightest angel who,<br />
longing for something beyond his reach, fell past stars</p>
<p>and planets to land here, on ours, having had a Word<br />
with an ex who turned His broad back everywhere<br />
and all at once as if even He</p>
<p>could call the whole thing off.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>White thorn, crimson hips.<br />
Pleasures of the without.  Pain of the without.</p>
<p>Venus tucks low here, disappearing<br />
into the mountains’ stadia.</p>
<p>What I can’t say, stepping into foreign tense<br />
of river, magnetic sluice, arctic tongs,</p>
<p>far-off source without mercy or care for me.<br />
My love has stories not mine to know</p>
<p>or ever tell.  Bruised fringe, black &amp; white maiden hair,<br />
lupine, fox ferns, do I project?</p>
<p>Sometimes.  I have a rash beneath my shirt,<br />
pubis to lonely breasts.  To pass a melancholy hour,</p>
<p>John Clare copied from the <i>Stamford Mercury<br />
</i>news of the elderly:   old lady by name of Faunt,</p>
<p>who at 105 “has lately cut new teeth,”<br />
a parish clerk, 115, “now able to read without spectacles,</p>
<p>&amp; dig graves.”  Sad swipe of late middle age,<br />
waters brutishly beautiful &amp; full of flame.</p>
<p>Thus runs the world alway, &amp; we incurable<br />
in its sway.  Say it:  the world taketh.</p>
<p>But even its farthest reach is ours,<br />
shed molar of horizon I pluck up &amp; carry, wet, away.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Even in sleep, I can’t sleep<br />
but am prone, paralyzed,<br />
a plucked &amp; boiled swan<br />
crooked in a gelatin of savory cherries, bays—<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Tak &amp; undo hym &amp; wash hym<br />
&amp; do on a spite &amp; unarme hym fayre</em>—<br />
broth of sleep-aids, ethanol,<br />
middle-age, denial, by nature<br />
breast-sogged, habitué of dank,<br />
mantled, melancholy pools.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hounds raised me up,<br />
guffaw of terror, sopped, shawled wings,<br />
carnelian legs dangling.<br />
Hawk dropped, the arrow struck.<br />
Whence now the lost dreams of racing<br />
through the old neighborhood,<br />
flight above the treetops conked with fire?<br />
Breasts like nuts that showed<br />
through vesture, waist two hands might span?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Hypnotics,<br />
youth’s a brief convent.<br />
<em>Salte it, &amp; boyle it wel in a postnet<br />
&amp; sesen it with a litel veynegre.</em><br />
Three gilt pills mark the Apothecary’s street.<br />
Try to hold the rue and signage as you go<br />
about that cobweb market.<br />
<em>Color it with the blood</em>:<br />
A courtly hue &amp; cry.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A ship wrecked off Hatteras, racked,<br />
Swamped, foundered, and pounded under<br />
The waves to flotsam, winds up as silver</p>
<p>Rubble on Greenland’s graveled shore.<br />
Half the keel, once half an oak<br />
Felled and dragged downriver from Portland</p>
<p>To the Essex, Connecticut shipyard,<br />
In the hands of the builder now becomes a roof-beam.<br />
Planks smoothed for the ship’s garstrakes</p>
<p>Hang now on leather hinges—a door.<br />
And loose hunks—shards of mast<br />
And bow-stem—burn in the stone hearth.</p>
<p>Copper, potassium, sodium flare<br />
Auroras of tropic color in the white-out<br />
Of Greenland winter—dream-fringed</p>
<p>Green, rose and coral mineral fire.<br />
In the morning cold in the rubble and ash<br />
A black ingot of ivory-hard, fire-tried</p>
<p>Oak for the carver to figure and pierce<br />
through—a knuckle-size talisman to be worn<br />
For luck around a sailor’s neck.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Willy gone with his knife to open birds or clean fish, practice<br />
lifting rows of bones out of caught bodies.  Up at the house old china-head<br />
Beulah, Aunt Ruby’s doll, watches from her shelf beside the glass<br />
pistol that once was Uncle Ralph’s toy, its round dead</p>
<p>candies still fading inside.  Annie’s stitches are snaggy, but they’ve followed<br />
Aunt Ruby’s sampler design; Lila’s only changed the maxim.  Tilly in the corner asking not<br />
one question till Lila complains she’s using up all the blue thread:  So?  &#8211;A tumbleweed<br />
sprouting a ladder to somewhere is her answer when Aunt Ruby demands <i>what</i></p>
<p><i>pattern is that?  What’s it supposed to teach?  &#8211;Got to make a real picture, Hon-oh,<br />
</i><i>a house with a garden, for heaven’s sake!  </i>A purple rose then, exploding from a house<br />
that rides choppy waves of letters spelling SOMEWHERE.  <i>Somewhere, over the rainbow<br />
</i>sings Lila as finally light fades and a breeze raises each face</p>
<p>to the window.  Deer at the shelterbelt’s edge, lifting heads as the swallows wheel,<br />
then one deer ripples up through the grain, the others following, into the field.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/audio/Continuation.mp3">Listen to the author reading this poem.</a></p>
<p>And the neighbor’s daughter shows my son<br />
the way her father let her hold his gun,</p>
<p>with bullets in it.  She was on Adderall,<br />
and now Ritalin, and they’re only in</p>
<p>Kindergarten but my son doesn’t much<br />
like her—the way she brags and lies</p>
<p>and tries to destroy the plants or bugs<br />
around our house, which is the bus stop,</p>
<p>so we head out each morning in our<br />
pajamas, clutching coffee mugs, to wait.</p>
<p>The engine of the bus is huffing,<br />
unmistakable, and we can all hear it</p>
<p>before its yellow nose comes around<br />
the bend.  The kids climb the high steps</p>
<p>like they’re scaling a great peak.<br />
I can see my son fling his body</p>
<p>into a seat; he waves from the window<br />
while Sarah makes her way to her</p>
<p>mandated spot behind the driver,<br />
who waves to us too, then pulls the lever</p>
<p>to shut the doors and heads down Heartwood<br />
Crossing, though the sign says Xing</p>
<p>as the whole name won’t fit.  This cross-<br />
hatch, this target; X marks the spot</p>
<p>like those yellow and black novelty<br />
signs:  Moose Xing, Gator Xing,</p>
<p>Sasquatch Xing.  my son loves to watch<br />
the show Finding Bigfoot, where</p>
<p>a research team goes to Rhode Island,<br />
Alaska, New York, to investigate</p>
<p>a recent spike in Squatch sightings.<br />
Each episode is exactly the same,</p>
<p>save for the location:  they go out<br />
as a team one night to look for bigfoot,</p>
<p>call for him, and find signs.  Next,<br />
they have a town hall meeting</p>
<p>to discuss sightings with residents<br />
who tell stories, which they recreate</p>
<p>using a giant guy named Bobo as a stand-in,<br />
and they always come to the conclusion</p>
<p>that the resident did see a bigfoot—<br />
that bigfoot could definitely live in</p>
<p>____________.  We live in blank.<br />
Sarah’s mother threw her father out</p>
<p>for keeping a loaded Uzi on the floor<br />
of their garage.  When Sarah aims,</p>
<p>with her fingers, at the empty birds’ nests<br />
in the eaves of our porch, I wait for her</p>
<p>to say bang, but instead she repeats<br />
<i>it had bullets in it</i>, and there’s the bus</p>
<p>wheezing around the bend again,<br />
yellow as a road sign, a daffodil,</p>
<p>a stretch of CAUTION tape.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">—<i>for Dad</i></p>
<p>Salvatore learns English from the movies<br />
where Charlton Heston holds the writhing<br />
Anne Baxter, a white actress made-up to look Egyptian<br />
and tragic. When she pulls away it means <i>hold me closer,</i></p>
<p><i></i><i>I don’t care</i> <i>if I’m caught</i>.  Sal’s mother hides<br />
in the subway to spy on the 6 o’clock train,<br />
her husband parting the crowd with his Heston chin.<br />
She says it’s her fault she married</p>
<p>a Northern Italian—blond and light skinned,<br />
a mouth full of straight teeth. She cuts<br />
the eggplant without looking, whole garlic cloves<br />
and basil; serves everyone before she serves herself.</p>
<p>Below their apartment the same old<br />
drunk starts to rant about his whore of a wife.<br />
Sal’s mother clears the plates with a look he will inherit<br />
and pass down—a creased brow un-creasing</p>
<p>with relief, when life is bad but not as bad<br />
as it could be. Curses barge through their window<br />
mixing with the voice of Moses, as the desperate<br />
drag everything they’ve got across the parted sea.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><i>Dorchester Neck, 1665<b> </b></i></p>
<p>Bent over a breeched calf, rain<br />
spinning off the placenta, I didn’t see<br />
the waves net the millpond<br />
to cut me off from shore.<br />
The black hound Luther yipped<br />
across the chasm. Lightning smote<br />
the islands. I had not recourse<br />
but to huddle with the herd.<br />
The slick calf quavered.<br />
White gold, His Hand<br />
swooped down the fume and moil<br />
and seized (I later heard)<br />
His servant, Captain Davenport,<br />
standing guard. When I could see<br />
again, despair was all. The fort<br />
across the harbor blazed,<br />
the air acid, tinged with green.<br />
Headlong the Hawk<br />
that plucketh the saint, his eyesockets,<br />
they said, smoking. Unsearchable<br />
is that translation. Then the tide<br />
ebbed, the gale ripped northward.<br />
As the sea parted for me,<br />
an unwitting captain,<br />
the millwheel pulsed and swung.<br />
It did seem to me to beat out<br />
the holy poem Mr. Warham taught me,<br />
“Unto myself, myself, myself…”<br />
But I couldn’t work it out,<br />
how many selves there were<br />
shot under the wheel before the word<br />
“betray” ground to grist for God’s<br />
bread the ‘I’ that once could not believe.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>For my grandson</em></p>
<p>&#8220;All wars are boyish, and are fought by boys.&#8221;<br />
&#8212; Herman Melville</p>
<p>Monument by monument we’ve found the site.<br />
You’re wearing an officer’s plumed hat<br />
chosen from shelves of replicas, and</p>
<p>over one shoulder an enlisted man’s haversack<br />
stocked with insignia, a clay pipe, a Minié ball—<br />
a ten-year-old, you’re the whole regiment.</p>
<p>You stretch full length beside a witness oak,<br />
on the sloping, lichen-covered stone<br />
where Mathew Brady’s assistants are lounging</p>
<p>in your book of views of the battlefield now<br />
and on the day after Lee’s retreat. The dead<br />
have already been exposed onto glass plates.</p>
<p>You walk the breastworks, now only a slight<br />
rise in the earth beyond the witness tree.<br />
History’s open in your hands. General Greene</p>
<p>and his 102nd New York made its stand<br />
here, defeating the 15th Louisiana<br />
coming through the woods. Lead poisoning</p>
<p>killed many of the trees, you teach me,<br />
and years after the battle, lightning<br />
would set off unexploded shells.</p>
<p>A school bus stops for a moment<br />
and you wave. Then fall mortally wounded,<br />
having so many postures to choose from.</p>
<p>Waiting for your picket to report back,<br />
you stand beside the oak, ostrich plume stirring<br />
in a light wind from the 2nd of July, 1863,</p>
<p>while a rider on horseback bending low,<br />
chunks of moss flying from hooves,<br />
hurtles fallen trees to reach this ground</p>
<p>where blood has yet to come up monuments.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A turquoise sky, its overflowing light<br />
splashing down on buttes, mesas, mountains,<br />
ravines, arroyos, canyons, caves, and flats,<br />
white sands where scaffolding abuts the sun<br />
and engineers are measuring the space<br />
between annihilation and the view.<br />
Oppie&#8217;s porkpie hat shadows his face,<br />
a skinny rabbit leaps out of his way.<br />
He&#8217;s nervous, tense, afraid that something will<br />
go wrong &#8212; there is so much that even now<br />
can go wrong.  There is the question of fallout.<br />
He hugs himelf while smoking, arms crossed,<br />
a pose so characteristic, so often noted,<br />
that actors who play him do the same.  The flood<br />
of light is only a metaphor, of course.<br />
In general, deserts are dry, and men<br />
measuring white sands are a mirage.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Gettysburg, July 1947</i></p>
<p>With my good heels<br />
and summer wools,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a conic slice among trapezoids<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plunged in grass and lapidific ducktails<br />
pushed east-northeast<br />
by cannon blast.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not in tears. Like the wild mint I lap<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against the monuments, breeding, bridling<br />
my green thoughts, my<br />
private riots.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take shape. America, made for orphans:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now you are made for me. So: I hoist this death<br />
as a bindle<br />
of bleached flannel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and hit this black road where motherless Lincoln<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stopped, his lackeys tripping in its cannon pocks.<br />
In his silence<br />
I see good sense.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cemeteries are like zoos: they teach the art<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of privacy behind their stamped gray placards.<br />
Inviolate<br />
as steel the at-<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-home hours of dens, of the dead. The bear sleeps<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or files its claws; it is not our business,<br />
unbeckoned to<br />
its lone curfew.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This side of that exquisite habitat, we<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the visitors, and pigeons shitting freely,<br />
uncaged. I am<br />
in memoriam,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am Jackie Robinson, I am Huck Finn –<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bastarded since my mother lay down with time.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An outdoor bench in the hospital gardens,<br />
the terrace bordered by waist-high,<br />
vase-shaped bushes. Because it was Sunday,<br />
the streets were empty and sounds not audible<br />
for the rest of the week were audible now.<br />
The opening and closing of a door. The voice<br />
of a man scolding his child. A moped stopping<br />
at the curb. Bird sounds, and not just city pigeons,<br />
but finches, chickadees, starlings, jays.<br />
The gardens weren’t too crowded, the sunlight<br />
wasn’t too bright, the air was neither too hot<br />
nor too cold. Though I observed them very carefully,<br />
the expressions on the faces of the people nearby<br />
were careful not to give anything away.<br />
To my left, the branch of a shade tree hollowed<br />
by insects still bore a few leaves, and where<br />
the forked trunk split, a plastic grocery bag<br />
was lodged like the nest of an animal or bird.<br />
And so the hour passed, each moment saved<br />
from a morning wasted in useless self-reflection,<br />
and by the time I went back indoors, anything<br />
seemed possible, happiness as well, as long<br />
as my mind kept pace with whatever<br />
new perceptions came my way.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>As if I were a newcomer to my own emotions,<br />
the first thing she asked me was “How do you feel?”<br />
I did my best to give her a thoughtful answer,<br />
but when I saw that she didn’t even note it<br />
on her legal pad, I began to revise, augment,<br />
elaborate on what I’d said. This went on until<br />
I was no longer sure what I was trying to say,<br />
as if my words had only confused my thoughts,<br />
and I felt the urge to ask if I could start over again.<br />
Perhaps to verify my impressions, she took up<br />
the narrative and played it back more or less<br />
in my own words, choosing this image,<br />
not that, this phrase, not that, carrying on<br />
until she reached the moment where I’d left off.<br />
But why stop there? Since we already shared<br />
a point of view, why not push on to the conclusion?</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>On the wall behind her, a hand-textured<br />
canvas print of Tuscan tiles, the brushstrokes<br />
varying from one square to the next, first left to right,<br />
then top to bottom, then left to right again.<br />
Though I expected it to be filled with tissues,<br />
the trashcan was empty, as was the acid green<br />
Lucite vase on the table. It seemed that<br />
wherever I rested my eyes I was reminded<br />
that I was talking to a stranger, and in so doing<br />
that I was learning all over what it means to exist.<br />
Pleased with the progress I was making,<br />
at session’s end she warmly extended her hand<br />
and I, in turn, received it (slavishly) in both of mine.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Waking early, as I often did, it took little effort<br />
to create the effect that something was in store for me,<br />
and whatever that was would come as a surprise.<br />
Likewise, nothing seemed more natural than<br />
the thought that I was led by rather than leading<br />
my life, the truth of experience always only about<br />
to be mine. Though the effect was brief, the memory<br />
of it lingered, and from time to time throughout<br />
the day it came over me, the sense that I was<br />
traveling “lifeward,” becoming myself all over again.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Eye-level in the overheated waiting room,<br />
a fireplace fire played in a loop on the television screen.<br />
It was difficult to tell where the loop began,<br />
though the logs continued to burn and the flames<br />
continued to rise. As if testing the heat of the fire,<br />
a child reached out then quickly withdrew his hand.<br />
Somewhere behind me a cell phone rang;<br />
in front of me, an old man in overalls<br />
tapped his leg with a magazine while his wife,<br />
tiny and archaic, sucked the inside of her cheeks.<br />
Out of consideration, no one looked at anyone<br />
directly, but at everyone from the corner<br />
of an eye. From time to time a man in white<br />
arrived to survey the room. He understood<br />
all of us, and all of us had something to be understood.<br />
From a distance it might’ve appeared<br />
that we were there because we had nothing better<br />
to do, and nowhere better to do it, that nothing<br />
mattered less than the world beyond the world inside</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Having signed out early in the afternoon,<br />
I bought apples at the farmer’s market, a wedge<br />
of pie at the bakery, a newspaper at a stand.<br />
On my way to catch the crosstown bus,<br />
I stopped to watch as one by one a tower crane<br />
raised a rusted (or rust-colored) I-beam<br />
from a flatbed up twenty-some stories to the roof<br />
of the City Services Wing. The framing in<br />
of the final floor provided occasion for a topping-off<br />
party in the courtyard of the art museum,<br />
a slate space where, each at a different angle,<br />
a number of canvas bannered tents were anchored<br />
to bags of sand. I sat down on the ledge<br />
of a raised concrete flowerbed planted with rows<br />
of Chicago Brick wrapped in woolen sweater scraps<br />
and sprinkled with mustard seeds. In a few small<br />
patches of light, some of the seeds had started<br />
to sprout, and now and then a woman I took to be<br />
the artist appeared with a watering can. Because,<br />
I assumed, the project required the theoretical<br />
silence of nature, my polite inquiries were met<br />
with an unresponsive stare.  Sympathetic as I am<br />
to the aesthetics of silence, to the childlike fantasy<br />
of escaping the material world of words, the cursive<br />
spray of her watering can and the fluent undulations<br />
that darkened the bricks gave rise to such intensity<br />
of feeling that even hours later, long after I’d stood<br />
and applauded the tedious speeches, I still bore<br />
the impression, the senseless, unshakeable impression,<br />
that I’d been made the butt of an elaborate joke.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>I once read in a book, which I now recall<br />
only in the vaguest terms, that we know the world<br />
not through our sensory perceptions—which are,<br />
at best, unreliable—but through our thoughts<br />
about those perceptions. At the time, the idea<br />
struck me with the force of revelation, for it seemed<br />
that in the delay between sense and reflection<br />
another unarticulated life, another stream<br />
of consciousness, continued on within me.<br />
And I remember thinking: “That’s just how it is!”<br />
On the other hand, there were days of inertia<br />
when the idea struck me as absurd, when thought<br />
seemed little more than a curtain between<br />
myself and the world. And on those days<br />
I made a point of limiting those dealings<br />
necessity requires to the barest possible details:<br />
“My social security number is…” “I need an MR 16<br />
halogen bulb.” “Go three blocks south, turn left<br />
on Lasalle, and you’ll find it next to a comic book store.”<br />
Clearly I hoped to achieve something.<br />
At the very least, to make better use of my time;<br />
at most, to keep my secrets to myself. To earn<br />
the right to observe the world without taking part,<br />
that was the dream: the bystander standing<br />
beside the fact, the fact standing on its own.<br />
A not entirely human dream but one,<br />
nonetheless, in which I was able to lose myself<br />
in the busyness of keeping myself alive.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Say our man is pissed—literally,<br />
he’s pissed himself, thrown from the trunks<br />
where he and five others clung.<br />
Towering pine-light, his top hat smashed—<br />
the other passengers yell for the driver.<br />
“Yellibama,” he remembers a wagonload<br />
of slaves calling it, whether for the goldenrod<br />
or the brick-clay coating everything<br />
or the pain of crossing this stopgap<br />
between rivers, he couldn’t say<br />
(they meant the mulattoes).<br />
Here, where soldiers baited the natives<br />
to dance naked for whisky, federal,<br />
he’s come to see, means inexorable<br />
over sand and swamp. A log-house<br />
beckoned here and there, hectic,<br />
or one of the wretched inns<br />
called kettles for their one accommodation.<br />
What’s all this around him? Underclothes.<br />
The lady’s valise—she’s rumored to be a strumpet—<br />
has fallen with him and exploded.<br />
They picked her up at Sodom<br />
on the Georgia border. Among her articles<br />
are perfume bottles and a sheaf of letters<br />
penned, no doubt, in as many rough hands.<br />
He endeavors to dry out and walk<br />
the rest of the corduroy road,<br />
the slick log ribs laid out with the order<br />
of corpses after battle, though the mosquitoes,<br />
legion, descend like Romans.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>M’Comie Mor, 7<sup>th</sup> Chief of Clan MacThomas, Perthshire, died in 1674, after his heir<br />
</em><em>and next-best son were  killed in a skirmish with Airlie’s Royalist allies.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Say he outlived his earthly rising stars:<br />
Ascendant when he rode in Montrose’ wars;<br />
Yet brighter blazed in Cromwell’s glory years</p>
<p>When he bought Lord Airlie’s lands and Barony.<br />
Then the lintel stone on M’Comie’s manse vowed he<br />
With God’s prized help would overcome envy—</p>
<p>Not his, but that in rival Airlie’s eyes.<br />
Did God withdraw His aid, when Cromwell died?<br />
Twelve years M’Comie Mor fought Royalist fines</p>
<p>And raids that bled our clan.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh I have seen<br />
The mightiest stag, the lord of swords and glens,<br />
Now slashed, now bled by weasel-snouted men!</p>
<p>As we grapple stones from broken castle walls<br />
To build for meaner needs, so let me haul<br />
This lesser net of rhyme: our clan was small;<br />
Great M’Comie made us great; with him we fall.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In this dismal niche, once waterfront before<br />
the dam, transients and those who stay too<br />
long, drink to blessed numbness or oblivion.<br />
Cold, grey, unchanging. Rooms by the day<br />
above the bar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An ill-starred ship lends its name to this neon<br />
aquarium. Strong drinks, hard winters.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was a woman. What seems, what is.<br />
Her lover fell through a trap door. Oh<br />
willow, willow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <i>Desdemona</i>—inbound from San<br />
Francisco—ran aground. Gave up its name<br />
one new year’s day to shoals and shifting<br />
sands north of the channel, where ocean and<br />
river oppose and churn.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sixteen million Chinook once ran this river,<br />
before the dam. Before loggers, trappers,<br />
fishermen. Draft horses, stabled offshore in<br />
barns on pilings, seined the river bar at ebb<br />
tide. Belly-deep in brackish water, they<br />
hauled out great arcing nets of glistening<br />
silver.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A beauty ran off with an older man, a<br />
foreigner. The river’s headlong rush.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She was in love, and he proved mad. Oh<br />
willow, willow. They foundered in the<br />
turbulent churn.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Annie’s Tavern Dancers down the street’s<br />
been closed. The canneries are gone. Two<br />
fish swim in opposite directions. The<br />
Desdemona Club (four pool tables, well<br />
drinks, fries) serves spirits and asylum from<br />
the storm.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>“Not Baptize’d.  Pray Let particular Care be Taken’</em><br />
<em>of this Child as it will be call’d for Again…&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Mary Jane Kelley</p>
<p>Where are they now &#8212; four Ribbons narrow (Purpil, pink, blue &amp; yellow)<br />
tyed on yer right wrist and worckt with flowers by my own hand –<br />
whereon was writ My Name is Julia?  Also: a piece of blue silk<br />
pin’d on yer Breast, so as to find ye later among the hundreds<br />
of Exposed and Deserteds left at ‘Ospital.  I had silk then,<br />
fresh from Paris. I had printed calico, and camblet and cream linen.<br />
Also:  cherryderry, calamanco, and satin flowered all over<br />
with sprigs and daisies.  Not this linsey-woolsey, which never rustles.</p>
<p>The weather fleured the day I brought ye in, pink and bawling<br />
and wanting to suckle.  “She has had the Breast so let her continue<br />
to take Nurishment” I wrote in a note pin’d to yer Cap. Yet take her away.</p>
<p>Mr. Flemming tuck’d a playing card with Hearts abounding<br />
among her cloathing, made from my finer cut-down dresses,<br />
to let them know my Tenderness &amp; Care.  Be ye never</p>
<p>as pretty as yer mother, Julia.<br />
Better brown linsey than silks flowered over.</p>
<p>[*Inspired by “Threads of Feeling,” the Foundling Museum of London’s traveling exhibition of token fabrics and mementos left with foundlings so that the abandoned infants might be later reclaimed. Notes left with the infants or stitched on the colorful ribbons and fabrics have been incorporated, with small modifications. “The weather fleured” is from John Berryman’s Dream Song #8.]</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She still can’t use scissors.<br />
She sits on the edge of her bed,<br />
holds out her wrist, blood-beaded,<br />
a bungled bracelet.  <em>I wish I was dead</em>—<br />
a whisper.  Like Andersen’s mermaid,<br />
she’s bartered away her voice.<br />
Outside in the dusk,<br />
a bedlam of children’s noisemakers—<br />
the tide of cicadas in summer’s trees.</p>
<p>She can’t cut.<br />
While she sang from her heart<br />
to Disney’s Little Mermaid,<br />
the canary yellow pair for lefties<br />
mauled paper between serrated teeth.<br />
<em>Wandering free</em>, <em>wish I could be</em> …<br />
To spring her from K5,<br />
I sheared 26 pictures from old magazines:<br />
“A—aqueduct” through “Z—zinnia.”</p>
<p>She can’t cut straight.<br />
I caught her at 10,<br />
remaking a dress and belting<br />
with Britney: <em>Hit me baby one more time</em>.<br />
She stabbed the hemline.<br />
At her feet, two ragged arms,<br />
a ripped turtleneck.<br />
Right then I should have scoured<br />
the house for sharp objects.</p>
<p>I curl over her<br />
as though to reclaim her with my body,<br />
reconnect our pulses.<br />
She’s <em>part of that world</em> of Grimm,<br />
whose spindle will have its way,<br />
the princess seduced to a sleeping wheel.<br />
How to play?  She’s all thumbs.<br />
Her mouth opens.<br />
The song spins to dust on her lips.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Ann Arbor, I&#8217;m reading obits<br />
in <em>The Weekly</em> from Ohio hills<br />
a day&#8217;s drive southeast.  I know<br />
almost no one now, including Luther Hoops,<br />
<em>who loved the Lord and worshipped</em><br />
<em>many years at Fairfield Baptist</em>, which<br />
sits halfway up a ridge near Soderburg,<br />
four hundred German Catholic souls<br />
a little north of Wargo&#8217;s curve.<br />
Beer was legal there.  Still is.</p>
<p>Luther Hoops: navy gunner, Normandy survivor,<br />
36 years a dozer operator, Southern Ohio Coal.<br />
<em>Surviving are Lena, his loving wife of 62 years.</em><br />
<em>six sons and four daughters</em> &#8212; only one<br />
lives more than twenty miles away.</p>
<p>He farmed, carved wood, restored machines,<br />
<em>enjoyed family cookouts and golf cart rides</em><br />
<em>with his beagle, Jimmy</em> &#8212; where gravel roads<br />
bend in maple shade or straighten out<br />
along a field of beans.</p>
<p>In Amish country one summer<br />
I saw a plow horse lying dead in a field.<br />
Three of his thick-legged mates<br />
had arranged themselves around him<br />
and stared.  I thought they looked solemn,<br />
worried.  The fallen horse was another<br />
kind of thing now, and they wondered<br />
what to do.  They stood together and waited<br />
till the farmer came to coax them home<br />
with feed he shuffled in a bucket<br />
to make a good, familiar sound.</p>
<p>What do draft horses eat?  A farming wife<br />
in some Ohio place had answered:<br />
<em>Ours get plain oats &#8212; two scoops.</em><br />
<em>I mix a couple drops of corn oil</em><br />
<em>to knock down the dust.  Ear corn &#8212;</em><br />
<em>four ears and alfalfa hay &#8212; free choice,</em><br />
<em>mainly grass mix &#8212; but richer</em><br />
<em>if we&#8217;ve got spare and they worked good.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The mystery of the catfish<br />
Is its sweetness,<br />
The gorgeous meat of it</p>
<p>Fed on the silt<br />
And bitterness a loner clings to<br />
At the bottom.</p>
<p>In its own element<br />
It’s close to weightless,<br />
A dark self</p>
<p>Respecting the sacrament of night.<br />
Who else acknowledges<br />
Solitude so obligingly,</p>
<p>Its filth a contradictory savor.<br />
See how it sways<br />
In the water’s music,</p>
<p>Washes its length in song,<br />
In slow adagios,<br />
All that pale flesh</p>
<p>Pressed against a lute of bones.</p>
