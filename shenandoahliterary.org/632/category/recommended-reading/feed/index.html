								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/632/files/2014/03/Flann.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-557" alt="Flann" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/632/files/2014/03/Flann.jpg" width="163" height="217" /></a>Flannery O’Connor’s personal prayer journal surprises with her passion and innocence toward faith, reminding the reader of the perspective of a young woman not fully evolved into the Southern Gothic writer that she is known as today. A kind stroke of luck introduced me to <em>A Prayer Journal</em> a few weeks ago when a friend lent me a copy; I had not yet heard about its publication at the time. I was initially surprised to experience such an immediate involvement with the text. A large part of the reason the journal captivates the reader’s attention comes from O’Connor’s honest display of her humanity. The unedited text allows the reader to see her original thoughts while writing, rather than the final product of many edits made ready for publication. The journal contains lines such as, “But I do not mean to be clever although I do mean to be clever on 2nd thought and like to be clever &amp; want to be considered so” (6), where the reader is given clear glimpses of O’Connor’s unique personality.</p>
<p>It is O’Connor’s personality that makes it possible to connect with the text, as the reader can easily internalize the words O’ Connor writes. The young Mary Flannery, only 20  at the time of the first entry, tugs at the reader’s emotions with candid lines such as, “Please help me dear God to be a good writer, and to get something else accepted” (10). Although O’Connor’s language is occasionally colloquial, she satisfies the literary readers by filling the text with vivid metaphors and unique allusions. In the first entry she exclaims, “You are the slim crescent of a moon that I see and my self is the earth’s shadow that keeps me from seeing all the moon”(3). Throughout the journal, the personal nature of the text does not detract at all from the quality and originality of O’Connor’s writing.</p>
<p>O’Connor’s youthful strictness in her faith occasionally provides some comedic aspects to the journal, but more importantly, demonstrates a measure of absolute dedication to her relationship with God that may be unknown to a casual reader of O’Connor. In the short few sentences of the journal’s last entry O’Connor writes, “Today I have proved myself a glutton – for Scotch oatmeal cookies and erotic thought. There is nothing left to say of me”(40). The seriousness in which she takes her Catholic faith lends a fresh perspective to the instances of religion in her other works, especially due to the fact that this journal was written before all of her major works. Certain parts of the journal provide such an intimate perspective of O’Connor that the reader often feels a small sense of guilt for intruding, as if the reader had stolen the diary like a mischievous younger brother.  O’Connor’s journal is quite short, containing only 38 pages with 24 entries, most of which do not take up a whole page. However, the combination of contrasting entries provides the reader with an intimate perspective on a young woman named Mary O’Connor, and on a time long before she wrote anything that was deemed ‘grotesque,&#8217; or should I say, ‘realistic.&#8217;  The author’s innocent and thoughtful youth delivers a refreshing and unexpected addition to Flannery O’Connor’s oeuvre.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I began skimming<em> Southern Sin</em> with the suspicion that I wouldn’t enjoy it.  The subtitle, <a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/632/files/2014/03/sin.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-533" alt="sin" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/632/files/2014/03/sin.jpg" width="135" height="204" /></a>“True Stories of the Sultry South &amp; Women Behaving Badly,” suggested a compendium of wanna-be-naughty memoirs of the predictable and superficial sort.  After all, “south” and “sultry” and “sin” – the buzz words of titillation, unreal “real housewives,” various shades of Confederate gray.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say that every essay in the book rises above formula and selfie impishness, but a number of the pieces turn out to be surprising in detail, stylish, self-interrogating, memorable.  Some rise above the protocols of confession to become examples of witness.  More useful than the subtitle in forecasting the volume&#8217;s tone and urgency is Dorothy Allison’s zesty introduction with its recommendation that we consider the famous seven deadlies as we engage with the collection, though lust dominates.</p>
<p>I always enjoy stories with a discernible “local habitation and a name,” but I’ll admit that my attention sharpened when I began to recognize in Sarah Gilbert’s “No Other Gods” the landmarks of my own community.  What really kept me going, however, was her revelation (maybe autopsy) of a certain recognizable class, a certain lifestyle, exposure without malice.  The writing is irreverent without predictable attitude, self-empowering without exaggerating the foibles of those around her, and Gilbert’s rhetorical strategies render her testimony almost incantatory.</p>
<p>One thing absent from the book but which I didn’t miss is the list of usual suspects – Rosemary Daniell, Ellen Gilchrist – the celebrity transgressor-belles whose tales have become a little too familiar.  And here I should confess that one of the new voices I really enjoyed was not new to me.  Full disclosure – Elyse Moody was one of my <em>Shenandoah</em> interns a few years ago, but her writing has deepened and sharpened in the intervening time.  I suspect her contribution “Trouble” is part of a larger work, an investigation into the foggy territory of family rumor and loose ends, and she succeeds, without resorting to spectacle, in making me want to know what makes this clan work; the case of self-defense under examination allows the author to explore place and custom and the process of her own practical education.  And where else were you going to find out that Rome, Georgia owns a bronze replica of the Capitoline Wolf, given to the Georgia town by Mussolini himself?  Nor will those hoping for a gothic detail or two be disappointed.  If it looks like I&#8217;m playing favorites, at least I&#8217;m not sneaking.</p>
<p>Elane Johnson&#8217;s &#8220;Porn Star&#8221; is amusing and surprising, not nearly so salty as the title suggests.  In fact, these &#8220;souvenirs&#8221; in language tend to be direct without being graphic, tasteful without being prissy.  The most off-key selection, to my ear, was the one piece by a male, Aaron Gwyn&#8217;s &#8220;Love in the Worst Way.&#8221;  Gwyn is a skillful writer who often writes sex with a directness that suits some but not all contexts.  His story felt like a misfit in this gathering, given its general weather.  But I have to say that a woman does behave badly in his essay, or perhaps like Jessica Rabbitt she&#8217;s just drawn bad.  Suzanne Roberts&#8217;s essay, also nervy, rang a little tinny, carried some of that expected exhibitionistic TMI, but now I begin to feel a little prudish myself.</p>
<p>Two additional features of note are journalistic in tenor and immediately arresting.  &#8220;Mad Love: The Ballad of Fred and Allie&#8221; by Sonja Livingston tells of &#8220;illicit&#8221; love, attempted elopement, disappointment, despair, crime and punishment in Memphis before Handy had set the blues to music.  The abbreviated nature of the piece contributes to its lyrical pitch and pathos.  Louella Bryant&#8217;s &#8220;Rum-Running Queen&#8221; whetted my appetite and left me wanting more about moonshining, hoodwinking, supercharging and &#8220;a white tailored dress with brown ruffled sleeves,&#8221; all relevant to notorious Willie Carter Sharpe of Franklin County and her daredevil, profitable avocation.  For those who want a familiar touchstone, think of the recent film &#8220;Lawless.&#8221;</p>
<p>Intensity and surprise twists, confession, regret, relief and triumph.  After all, it&#8217;s all about the garter belt and the Bible belt, holding out and giving in and all the attendant joys, confusion and anguish.  I don&#8217;t know how gendered my reading is, but Gutkind and Fennelly offer up a couple of dozen stories, few clumsy, not many irritating, a full dozen of them re-readable.  Text on the back of the book claims these are &#8220;stories of women flirting with perdition,&#8221; which is no small matter for either gender, but flirtation is the minor chord in this anthology.  It&#8217;s worth reading for the major ones, the pain and the heaving laughter, that whole famous Faulkner list involving the human heart.</p>

		<title>Shadow of the Wind by Carlos Ruiz Zafon</title>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/632/files/2014/03/shadow_of_wind.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-515 alignright" alt="shadow_of_wind" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/632/files/2014/03/shadow_of_wind.jpeg" width="128" height="196" /></a>The streets of post-war Barcelona are veiled in <em>The Shadow of the Wind</em>, and something lurks in the darkness. This is the truth that Daniel Sempere learns as he endeavors to uncover the secrets of the eponymously named book he found as a child in a secret library. The book, written by one Julián Carax, may be the last surviving piece of the author’s work; someone has committed himself to destroying every copy printed under Carax’s name. Carlos Ruiz Zafón guides his reader through the gothic and enchanting Barcelona cityscape via Daniel’s investigations. Among descriptions that paint the old beauty of the setting, the author also creates a sinister air which suggests danger under every cobblestone. This duality is complemented by dense characters that are seldom as they seem. Zafón’s physical descriptions and careful dialogue disclose deceptions to the perceptive reader. Just as the image of a cigarette alight in the dark pulls the reader into the shadows, so too does each dismissive word or nervous glance ask the reader to inquire further after the characters’ pasts.</p>
<p>Zafón pays homage to older Romantic and Gothic writers with his elegant prose ripe with skillful metaphor. Readers afraid of bristling with envy at the imagery should leave this book alone. Readers ready with a stack of notes to mark memorable quotations, however, should uncap their highlighters – there’s no shortage. Similarly poetic is the description of the characters and their dialogue. This results in vivid exchanges that remind the reader of watching a film. At times, this results in some excessively dramatic exchanges. Despite the allure of the writing, it’s still evident that real people don’t talk or act like these characters sometimes do. Granted, many of the characters are well-read and eloquent, but the author sacrifices more believable dialogue in favor of profound and quotable quips. Zafón at times strays into an overabundance of stylistic writing – the same thing that captures you might lose you too.</p>
<p><em>The Shadow of the Wind</em> will not be filed away under great literature. Sometimes it feels overwrought, though this may be partially the fault of the translator. It won’t instigate tremendous introspection. It will leave you caring about the characters and enchanted with its gothic Barcelona. It will leave you thinking about it in between readings and days after your finish. If you want beautiful writing and a story to invest yourself in, this book will deliver those expectations. You’ll sprint through this book just as quickly as I did.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="size-full wp-image-449 alignright" style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;" alt="A_Visit_From_the_Goon_Squad" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/632/files/2014/03/A_Visit_From_the_Goon_Squad.jpg" width="200" height="299" />Winner of the 2011 Pulitzer Prize for fiction, Jennifer Eagen’s <i>A Visit from the Good Squad</i> presents a compilation of short stories that vary in time, place, and perspective. Though each story stands independently, most published in newspapers and magazines by themselves over the course of a few years, together the individual vignettes combine to form a whole. Common themes weave through the sections to form a montage of the self-contemplation of time—the past self, the present self, and the future self. Eagen introduces a quirky yet relatable cast of music world misfits on journeys of self-discovery.</p>
<p>Each story presents the characters at different times in their lives, from adolescence to adulthood to the not-so-distant future. Eagen introduces Bennie Salazaar as a music producer at Sow Ear Records in New York City. We meet Sasha, Bennie’s assistant with the uncontrollable compulsion to steal. Later we journey with Sasha through Naples and the Italian coast. We observe Bennie as a teenager, who along with Alice, Jocelyn, Scotty, form a 1979 punk-rock band striving for fame in rundown, San Franciscan garages. Eagen introduces Lou Kline, an eccentric music producer who overindulges in drugs and women, recognizes Bennie’s young talent, and makes Bennie his protégé. Eagen reacquaints us with Scotty in his adulthood when he coins the phrase “Time’s a goon” while he contemplates his unaccomplished life, wondering how he digresses as a person over time. Jocelyn reaches adulthood and panics:</p>
<p>We stand there, quiet. My questions all seem wrong: How did you get so old? Was          it all at once, in a day, or did you peter out bit by bit? When did you stop having parties? Did everyone else get old too, or was it just you? Are other people still here, hiding in the palm trees or holding their breath underwater? When did you last swim your laps? Do your bones hurt? Did you know this was coming and hide that you knew, or did it ambush you from behind?</p>
<p>What does time do to the individual?</p>
<p>Eagen creates sharp, distinct stories with strong characters who captivate the reader and carry the plot from one section to the next. The author displays her phenomenal style through unique diction and phrases. Each character possesses a distinct identity and backstory, providing a wide spectrum of readers to find a character to empathize with. Eagen fills the book with outside information that relates to the time period, like popular songs from each era, to validate the book’s reality. She presents her innovative flair by including a section by Sasha’s daughter, a slide show entitled “Great Rock and Roll Pauses—By Allison Blake” with diagrams and flow charts that depict the Blake family in seventy-four pages. Eagen’s style includes a playful tone supplemented with dark imagery to connect with characters’ emotions throughout time.</p>
<p>This coming of age story grasps the reader’s attention, offering an opportunity for him or her to identify with the different characters throughout their various stages of life. The music world misfits lose friends in one era and attempt to reestablish the broken bonds in another. But it is the music industry that ties the characters together, and in the end, it is the power of music that reconnects the characters not only to each other but also to their individual selves. The characters are living in the past; they dwell on former habits and mindsets, and hope for a better future that will continue to be far away as long as they remain in the past. Each character attempts to find themselves as individuals and to find their place in society.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shenandoahliterary.org/632/files/2014/03/hike.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-553" alt="hike" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/632/files/2014/03/hike.jpg" width="156" height="237" srcset="https://shenandoahliterary.org/632/files/2014/03/hike.jpg 317w, https://shenandoahliterary.org/632/files/2014/03/hike-198x300.jpg 198w" sizes="(max-width: 156px) 100vw, 156px" /></a>Douglas Adams’ <i>Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy </i>is a great example of comedic social commentary; it is very easy to read for humor, but it offers deeper social commentary, should the reader desire it. Originally created as a radio story, the first installation was compiled and printed in 1979 as a novel. Adams’ story follows the adventure of Arthur Dent an exceedingly average Englishman, and his friend and Ford Prefect, (revealed to be a stranded alien just prior to the destruction of Earth) who escape the ruin of Earth by hitching a ride on the spaceships that blew it up. Arthur and Ford proceed to take a seemingly random ride through space, meeting the president of the galaxy, finding out the meaning of everything, and running into Arthur’s ex-girlfriend. In the course of their adventure, Arthur learns to appreciate the wonderful disconnection of a universe driven primarily by greed and personal advancement, often portrayed through caricatures of human personalities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While many authors would shy away from such obviously extreme plot devices, Adams layers them in as heavily as possible. In a stark exclamation of style, he produces irreverent humor from the utter improbability and chaos he creates. Similarly, not many authors could pull off something as bold as blowing up the Earth in the introductory chapters and still make it both hilarious and agreeable to the reader. Adams’ direct, almost deadpan comedy highlights his message about the general silliness of society, even intergalactic ones. He couches his commentary comfortably in metaphors that point out the hilarity of disproportion humanity faces, such as “‘Space,’ it says, ‘is big. Really big. You just won&#8217;t believe how vastly hugely mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean you may think it&#8217;s a long way down the road to the chemist, but that&#8217;s just peanuts to space’”. In every aspect of this work Adams strives to invoke biting satire about the human condition, the enormity of the galaxy (both in terms of size and seriousness) outside of mankind, and, especially, politics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several supporting characters, such as Zaphod Beeblebrox, the incompetent (and valued for being so) celebrity president of the galaxy, and Marvin the depressed existential android contribute to the cast, creating a mélange of character development and criticism. On the surface this novel appears to be nothing more than a slightly nonsensical comedy, but if read carefully, Adams’ wit evolves into something broader. This work is slightly older, but the themes are just as fitting today as they ever have been. <i>Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy </i>should be read at least twice, once for the inherent beauty of Adams’ comedy, and again for his subtle and scathing opinions on the contrivances of “modern” life once the reader is in on the joke.</p>

Dorothy Allison’s <i>Bastard Out of Carolina</i> struck me immediately with its strong narrative voice and undeniable sense of place. It went on to challenge me with some difficult themes, like abuse and the interlocking system of oppression that is poverty. On multiple levels, I was affected by the book more than I expected, and I pined for it within moments of finishing the last page.</p>
<p>Ruth Anne Boatwright, affectionately known as “Bone,” has struggled with her name throughout her life. In South Carolina during the 1950’s, being born to unmarried parents results in being stamped with the ultimate dis: bastard. Her only secure sense of identity comes from her tender relationship with her mother and her mother’s siblings: Aunt Ruth, Aunt Alma, and Uncle Earle, just to name a few. Her Aunt Ruth denounces the title, “bastard child,” insisting “an’t no stamp on her nobody can see” (Allison 3) When Bone is just a toddler, her mother, Anney, marries a loving man named Lyle Persons. It seems like Anney may have found relief from her lifelong poverty, if not from financial burdens, from the shame of being a single mother. Lyle dies tragically in an accident, leaving Anney on her own, broken hearted and aged beyond her years. It seems like it couldn’t get much worse, but in walks Daddy Glen.</p>
<p>Anney’s marriage to Daddy Glen creates a slew of problems for Bone. He abuses her from an early age. He provokes her to act out against him so that he might continue to have an “excuse” to abuse her. His stuck-up family treats Bone and her sister Reese like animals, forcing them to eat outside at family gatherings because they “might track dirt in the house.” Yet there are enough peaceful moments to soften the edges and make this book worth reading. Bone cherishes evenings spent on Granny’s porch listening to stories and drinking sweet tea. Anney’s 2 am breakfast is an oasis in the midst of Bone and Reese’s hunger, featuring homemade biscuits with jelly, fried tomatoes, and eggs that “melt like butter between your teeth and your tongue” (Allison 77-78). While the book is certainly challenging thematically, it reads like a good story would be told, rich with details like “Kool-Aid and cookies after Sunday school” (174). A story of family, classism, and identity, this book is much more than something to read. It is an experience, a way of feeling unfamiliar emotions and understanding characters on a human level. If you’re ready to be transported to that “caught up in a book” state, look no further than <i>Bastard Out of Carolina.</i></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignright" alt="s9780099458289" src="https://shenandoahliterary.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/s9780099458289-194x300.jpg" width="128" height="198" />Are they delusional or just sympathetic? The characters in Sebastian Faulks’ novel <i>A Week in December</i> appear to be both. The narrative encompasses a number of alternative realities, from the online Parallax universe of Jenni Fortuneto the marijuana-fueled haze of Finn Veals’s teenage world. Each of these secondary worlds exists outside of the ‘real world’ of present-day London, but all demonstrate an attempt to escape the more alarming and disturbing reality of modern society. The most successful, and perhaps most realistic, of these alternative realities is the Fantasy Finance world of John Veals. The greedy financier ignores the needs of his family and the harmful effects of his financial policies on the community as a whole. He flaunts his mathematical prowess in order to demonstrate his intellectual dominance and appears disinterested even in the money he makes. In short, Veals is a selfish ass. He’s also the central character within the novel. Marked by a skewed moral compass and a complete lack of empathy, the money manager monopolizes the pages of the novel as author Faulks illustrates the workings of his backwards mind.</p>
<p>Potentially problematic to the success of any novel is a major character without any redeeming characteristics. A narrative such as <i>A Week in December</i>, which lacks a central protagonist, especially risks losing readership by continuously returning to an off-putting personality like Veals. Where’s the happy ending? Where are the consequences for his greed and insensitivity? Veals’s son Finbar appears as the most direct recipient of this falsified family structure. Finn, armed with more cash than he knows what to do with and no parental guidance, overdoses on a dangerous drug compound. Yet even the near-death experience of his son fails to motivate the elder Veals to change his ways. Without spoiling the plot, the novel ends with Veals alone and content in his self-indulgence, sans remorse or retribution.</p>
<p>How could I enjoy such a novel? This is where the genius of author Sebastian Faulks emerges. The secondary reality Faulks builds for Veals appears closer to actual reality than is initially evident—Veals may be a despicable character, but he closely mirrors Wall Street tycoons during the early 2000s. The novel becomes a relevant treatise on modern social strata. Examples of other alternate realities include the online gaming system that mimics modern-day London and the competitive literati world inhabited by failed novelist R. Tranter. Each of these secondary worlds makes the novel relatable to its readers rather than putting a neat bow on modern dynamics of culture. The result is a narrative that both allows for a sense of escapism from the ‘real world’ and realistically reminds readers of its relevancy in contemporary society.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Linda Hogan’s novel <i>Solar Storms</i> is a beautifully written window into the life of an American Indian teenager and the family that she is inextricably bound to. Drawing on her own experiences from growing up a Chickasaw Indian, Hogan is able to paint a realistic and deeply touching first person narrative that not only tells her protagonist Angela’s story, but also gives overwhelmingly tangible descriptions of life as an American Indian.</p>
<p>Angela, a seventeen-year-old American Indian girl, tells her story of searching for her birth mother. After searching court records, she finds a woman whom she believes to be her great grandmother and who, by some crazy fate, is still alive. After getting in touch with this woman, Angela begins her journey to find her mother. At many points in her quest, Angela stops to reflect on her surroundings. At times, she describes her great-grandmother Agnes, who is now traveling with her, wears a blue-gray tattered fur coat and carries two plastic grocery bags, one in each hand, of all of their belongings.</p>
<p>The true strength in Hogan’s writing is her ability to tap into the honest American Indian way of relating all things back to the earth that created them. Even Agnes and Angela see themselves as a part of a whole, and also as people who will one day return to the earth that they came from. Hogan constantly notes the smells of the earth and the texture of the nature that surrounds them—Angela smells the musky smell of autumn and notices winters without wolves. There is a heightened level of perception that Hogan not only writes, but lends to her readers as well.</p>
<p>Though there have been many successful American Indian authors, and even female American Indian authors such as Louise Erdrich and Joy Harjo, Hogan finds her own niche within this already unique group by fully embodying her teenage character.  She seamlessly weaves her story into those of her mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother, all the while constructing a setting so real that readers may feel like they are watching the story unfold.</p>

<p>“There’s no <i>one</i> thing that’s true.  It’s all true.” – Ernest Hemingway.  So reads the epigraph at the beginning of Paula McLain’s novel <i>The Paris Wife</i>.  A carefully researched book, <i>The Paris Wife</i> offers readers a new side of Hemingway’s “truth” (or should I say an alternate fiction) – an intimate story based on the courtship and marriage of Ernest Hemingway and his first wife, Hadley Richardson, from her point of view.  Despite some moments of cliché and frustration, <i>The Paris Wife</i> is a raw, refreshing take on one of the literary world’s most fabled romances.</p>
<p>In Hemingway’s novels, Hadley remains relatively voiceless.  She is an object of love and admiration; less of a fully developed human than a tool off of which Hemingway bounces self-consumed emotions and musings.  McLain allows Hadley to flourish as a character, and even more as a narrator, providing a thought provoking look at the world that, traditionally Hemingway’s, becomes Hadley’s.</p>
<p>From the very beginning, Hadley is an endearing and engaging woman.  McLain makes her adorably uncool (she was, as Janet Maslin wrote in her review of <i>The Paris Wife</i> for <i>The New York Times</i>, “admittedly unfashionable”).  The book begins:  “It’s October 1920 and jazz is everywhere.  I don’t know any jazz, so I’m playing Rachmaninoff.”  While Hemingway was often the (flawed) hero of his writing and took on a ruggedly heroic persona in his own life, Hadley is the undeniable heroine of <i>The Paris Wife</i>.  She is a different kind of heroine:  eloquent and understated, womanly in a strong, sturdy way, loving, loyal, and steadfast (though at times to the point of frustration).</p>
<p>The reader watches the events depicted in classic Hemingway works such as <i>A Moveable Feast</i> and <i>The Sun Also Rises</i> unfold from Hadley’s point of view.  We are privy to her opinions of the famous characters who surrounded the Hemingways:  Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, F. Scott Fitzgerald.  We look on helplessly as Hemingway falls in love with Pauline Pfieffer before our (and Hadley’s) eyes and as Ernest and Hadley’s marriage falls into dysfunction and decay.</p>
<p>I want to say that I fell in and out of love with Ernest as Hadley does, but that was just not the case.  McLain’s Hadley acknowledges Hem’s unique genius and his good, despite his self-absorption, infidelity, and immaturity for much longer than I could.   Perhaps the most striking example of this was McLain’s depiction of Hadley reading “Tatie’s” (her nickname for Hemingway) draft of <i>The Sun Also Rises</i>:  “when he gave me the pages to read, it took me no time at all to realize that everything was just as it had happened in Spain . . . It was all nearly verbatim, except for one thing – I wasn’t in it all.”  And yet, Hadley remains calm and unbelievably reasonable:  &#8220;&#8216;I could see how remarkable the work was, more exciting and alive than anything he’d ever written&#8217; . . . &#8216;Is it any good?&#8217;  Ernest said when I’d finally finished.  &#8216;I have to know.&#8217;  &#8216;It’s more than good, Tatie.  There’s nothing like it anywhere.&#8217;”</p>
<p>I have to admit that moments like this were a bit frustrating.  I felt sorry for Hadley and admired her poise and composure, but I wanted desperately for her to ditch Hem before he turned Pauline into his live-in girlfriend (or at least be a little more angry about it).  However, McLain does have Hadley eventually address that frustration, allowing the reader access to her anger and hurt:  “I wanted to scream.  I didn’t scream, and that became one of the things I grew to regret.”</p>
<p>Although this novel is a fictionalization of Hem and Hadley’s relationship, it is heavily based on true events, and McLain conducted intensive research prior to its writing.  She read letters of, as she referred to it, their “delicious correspondence,” and Hadley’s speech for the book was modeled on her language patterns in those letters.  Much of the time, McLain’s bare, straightforward writing style (and Hadley’s speech) mimics Hemingway’s signature barebones melodrama:  “how sad and strange we all are,” Hadley at one point laments.  Although this writing style is classic and beautiful, the book at times feels like a parody of Hem’s style.  This is especially noticeable in the few italicized chapters from his point of view:</p>
<p>“<i>The rich had better days and freer nights.  They brought the sun with them and made the tides move.  Pauline was a new model of woman and why couldn’t he have her?  Why couldn’t he reach out and claim everything he wanted?</i>”</p>
<p>“Who the hell does this guy think he is?” McLain, Hadley, and I seemed to be asking together.  It felt good to question him.</p>

The collection contains four sections, each capturing some facet from the speaker’s childhood, abusive marriage, and struggle to find happiness in a world haunted by her “figment,” Lilianna. Lilianna’s presence makes itself known from the very beginning, with the collection’s first chilling poem “The Figment.” The figment, Lilianna, is described as one who “vanishes” and returns in many forms—“just as God does.” In this poem and throughout the collection, Lilianna serves as a spirit like manifestation of the speaker’s intense grief; she floats, a broken off piece of what used to be a whole woman, one to whom the speaker can tell about “sadness,” while she thinks about “one way of living: slipping off / into some indistinguishable state / of more and more snow.”</p>
<p>With this introduction, Seay provides the template for the rest of the collection: a journey through the cold, seemingly endless world in which the lines between past and present, reality and imagination, and right and wrong are crossed and blurred. In <i>To See the Queen</i>, Seay’s striking line breaks and calm, salient images to make each poem resonate, gong-like. And Lilianna hovers in the sound waves. While each poem differs in content, Seay deftly weaves motifs of space, elements, and love, all the while questioning what it truly means to “see.”</p>
<p>In a later poem, “Room of the Curved Spines,” the speaker speculates on the dangerous nature of bad habits and bad influence as she recalls a moment in a middle-school bathroom, where “the girls / stood in line as a string of beads / and one by one we removed our blouses&#8230;vertebra by vertebra we were inspected like pearls.” The poem offers a sinister picture of anorexia contrasted with the youthful perception of beauty like “pearls,” noting, “Before long, things become permanent.”</p>
<p>The collection has the unique effect of capturing a myriad of compelling moments and cataloguing them into one book that seems to relay not just a narrative, but also a journey. Seay’s deeply personal voice sings a sad yet wrenchingly powerful song from poem to poem, and you cannot help but nod along empathetically as you turn each careful page. Seay draws you into her town (another compelling metaphor throughout the collection), and you find yourself sinking with her, chilled when she is chilled, questioning the abusive nature of God and man and then finding solace in an ultimate recovery—all the while, feeling Lilianna’s silent presence in the background. <i>To See the Queen</i> is a striking addition to contemporary poetry. Seay strikes the perfect balance between the sacrament of the mundane and the heart of the human conflict. She sings out to that need to imagine and mourn, that ache to find comfort and visualize hope.</p>

<p>Gary Jackson’s collection of poetry, <i>Missing You, Metropolis,</i> features unique subject material and authentic language. Just look at the title. Hopefully you recognize Metropolis and connect it to something in your past—think back to red capes and a countless number of action-packed comic strips. And just as the title suggests, Jackson’s writing has everything to do with the fantastical world of superhero legends, including references to Superman, Spiderman, Batman and X-men.</p>
<p>His quirky and original writing style makes his poems enjoyable and easy to read. The author straddles the threshold between somber, serious tone and silly, unnecessary fluff by creating a fresh and un-clichéd idea of normal super human beings. Whether it’s “In a Conversation about Superheroes,” where young boys debate and fantasize about Mystique (the Invisible Woman, Storm and Shadowcat), or in “Upon Seeing Spider-Man on my Way to Work,” where the narrator dreams about what it would be like to be the “bastard webslinging over electric Soho,” Jackson creates an extremely entertaining flashback to comic books, TV shows and superhero movies for the reader to relive.</p>
<p>Not every reader has to be a die-hard fan of comic book legends to appreciate Jackson’s work. This poet is capable of capturing a wide range of audiences: he explores beyond the celebrated superhero status by delving deep into the more intimate and emotional details of the characters’ lives. In the poem “When Loving a Man Becomes too Hard,” the speaker reveals, “Mary Jane confesses she sometimes makes Peter wear the costume when they fuck,” creating a scenario between Spiderman and The Incredible Hulk’s respective lovers, Mary Jane and Betty Ross. The women, over a bottle of good merlot, ponder their romantic relationships and admit somewhat dark humor memories of their bedroom experiences. Jackson’s vivid descriptions of human emotion and his frank writing style bring a sense of truth and reality to his collection of poetry.</p>
<p>Jackson magnifies everyday conflicts, dilemmas and scenarios by applying them to superheroes—the distorted versions of human beings. His portrayal of superheroes as if they are everyday figures make his readers question whether there is a real difference between the invincible figures in the sky and the civilians on the street. Winner of the 2009 Cave Canem Poetry Prize, Jackson brings childhood back in a more adult way.</p>
<p>Excerpt from “The Dilemma of Lois Lane”</p>
<p>And I don’t know which man<br />
is real. Sometimes,<br />
when we’re alone at home,<br />
fixing dinner, you’ll pretend</p>
<p>to wince when you cut yourself,<br />
and I find myself hoping<br />
that the tiniest drop of blood<br />
will bloom on your finger.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">Natalie Diaz opens her debut collection of poetry, <i>When My Brother Was an Aztec</i>, with the Spanish proverb, “No hay mal que dure cien anos, ni cuerpo que lo resista,” to introduce the reader to the Spanish influence on Native Americans, a theme that runs rampant throughout her poetry via allusions to or inclusions of Spanish words.  The proverb translates as, “Nothing lasts forever; this too shall pass,” a hopeful remark that suggests Diaz’s ability to cope with life both on and after the reservation.  Her forty-six poems consider the hardships of Native American life after colonization and Christianization.  Diaz throws the reader right into the middle of drug and alcohol abuse, racism, and diabetes, proving the enduring effects of post-colonial traumatic stress disorder.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">The collection features three sections that represent different aspects of Diaz’s experiences.  The first largely focuses on Diaz’s diabetic grandmother, the second on her drug-addict of a brother, and the third on the sadness and pain that accompanies reservation life.  Some of Diaz’s poems will wound a reader—its beautifully crafted language still cannot mask the sharp, stinging pains that come from reading of her Aztec brother, relentless racism, or her diabetic grandmother.  In “The Beauty of a Busted Fruit” the speaker remembers her childhood of wanting scars to prove her endurance but admits:</p>
<blockquote><p>           All this before we knew that some wounds can’t heal,<br />
before we knew the jagged scars of Great-Grandmother’s<br />
amputated legs, the way a rock can split a man’s head<br />
open to its red syrup, like a watermelon, the way a brother<br />
can pick at his skin for snakes and spiders only he can see.</p></blockquote>
<p>The speaker provides these horrifying images in a poem so beautiful that by the end of it the reader has almost forgotten what he has just learned—yet these jarring images remain, shaking the reader from complacency.  Diaz demonstrates that she has learned “to see the beauty of a busted fruit,” intimating that she loves not despite all of these imperfections, but instead <i>for </i>these imperfections.<i> </i></p>
<p><i>When My Brother Was an Aztec</i> reflects Diaz’s experiences as a Native American living on the reservation.  She admits that much of her poetry is autobiographical, and therefore the reader can often replace the speaker with the author herself.  This intimate experience offers a moving and convincing connection to the author, something that a reader cannot often guarantee from a novel or a poetry collection.  Diaz doesn’t hold back from the truth, and the reader begins to see Diaz’s poetry as her own means of coping with Historical Trauma.</p>
<p>Even before the first section, Diaz opens with her title poem, “When My Brother Was an Aztec.”  This is the first impression the reader has of Diaz’s poetry, and it is not one to forget.  The poem recounts Diaz’s experiences with her meth-addict brother and how his drug abuse unravels their family.  She shows the reader how he “sacrificed [her] parents / every morning,” forced them to “[forget] who was dying, who was already dead.”  He “gobbled” the “crushed diamonds and fire,” portraying him as an animal, a monster, who turned her family’s house into a zoo.  Yet despite his devastating and self-destructive habits, Diaz remarks how her “parents’ hearts kept / growing back,” suggesting the unconditional love that comes with family, no matter how much hurt a son or brother can cause.  The reader’s first impression of Diaz’s poetry is of unabashed honesty that evokes sympathy and heartbreak.</p>
<p>Diaz experiments with structure in many of her poems to prove how the organization of a poem is every bit as important as its content.  “When My Brother Was an Aztec” follows a stair-step pattern to show that as Diaz and her family follow her brother farther and farther down his destructive path, there is no way to return.  “Hand-Me-Down Halloween,” an endearing and heart-wrenching recollection of the speaker’s first Halloween off the reservation, uses slashes to break up clusters of words.  When the reader omits the words between every other set of slashes, s/he removes the skin-color designations and, subsequently, the emotional impact of the poem.  “Abecedarian Requiring Further Examination of Anglikan Seraphym Subjugation of a Wild Indian Rezervation,” uses an elementary technique reserved for learning: the first line begins with A, the next with B, the third with C, and so on and so forth until Z.  Diaz also makes sure to include each letter of the alphabet in the title, hence why certain words feature alternate spellings.</p>
<p>Joining writers like Louise Erdrich and Sherman Alexie, Diaz cements her place in Native writing by portraying the suffering that comes from colonization.  She alternates between startling, vulgar imagery and stunning, powerful language to engage the reader in Native storytelling.</p>
