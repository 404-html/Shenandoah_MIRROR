					<description><![CDATA[Glad to read &quot;Witness Tree...&quot; in the spring issue of Shenandoah.  I&#039;ve enjoyed the serendipitous fact that you and I are both &quot;literary neighbors&quot; in the spring issues of both The Hudson Review and The Sewanee Review.  I especially like &quot;Pull, Don&#039;t Push&quot; in Hudson.  Reading your Crossovers volume now and looking forward to reading Catchment.  (I&#039;m going to be a &quot;belated&quot; literary neighbor in Shenandoah--&quot;Poem Noir&quot; is slated for its summer issue.)  Take care, and keep up the good work.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a masterful piece.  There&#039;s such distinctly different characterization between Henry and Beth - Henry blunt and strong and willing to risk, Beth more held back, cautious - and so much of it captured and conveyed in the details, the little things (Henry needing Beth to stop her from biting her own cheek, it was Henry who suggested the ice boat). I love that this story starts with (or starts immediately after) Beth doing what Beth would rarely do: taking a risk. But she tried the safe path with Leonard, and what did they get her? And so here, we see her changing - risking so much by telling Henry, risking as the Jeep slid across the ice. &quot;The littleness of what she wanted could make her bones ache if she let it&quot; - this line is so right and true and perfect.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Women relate in such a complicated universe of contradiction, expectation, jealousy, and tacit understanding. Beth and Henry are authentic, recognizable. You caught the intrinsic truth that age does not alter our self-image and self-doubts, that women in their sixties still feeling the hurt and insecurity of adolescence--still fantasize about romantic possibilities, still compete, even with their best friend.The difference is that they recognize and regret the incongruity of feelings that they suspect belong by right to the young. I learned a lot about a way of life with which I am totally unfamiliar. I found myself rereading passages to more explicitly comprehend the mechanics of ice- fishing, the role of the ice house, the sliding spree in Sir Wildgin. I liked being challenged that way. I loved the independence, skills, and strength of these women who defy literary stereotypes and who are so much more real. Thanks for a great, engaging read!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This piece is so powerful. I agree that schools should focus on the value and complexity of many different languages, rather than sticking to a canon that privileges mainly white, male, and Western writers. I also think that there is sometimes more room for diversity of language, dialect, etc. in poetry than there is in prose, and I hope that will change with time. No writer should ever feel discouraged by language &quot;rules&quot; when the content and what moves others is all that really matters, at least to me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like this a lot—an excellent tension between humor and the genuinely sinister. The predatory, truly mean Charles Russell is still funny. Selene’s gift of hot dogs is curiously touching but also comically inept. I hope she develops more effective ways of dealing with the likes of Charles Russell, but I’m not optimistic about either character’s ability to change—so the story might be grimmer than it seems. (The names are perfect, by the way).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love this poem. I read Marianne Moore for the first time in a Modern American poetry class last semester, and I think that you&#039;ve captured the eccentricities form and style beautifully. I also think that the poem would be powerful even without that knowledge. The poem doesn&#039;t just mimic Moore; it is a testament to her.]]></description>
