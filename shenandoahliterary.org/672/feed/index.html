								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There has always been something operatic, even tragic, about the idealistic sweep and hypocrisy of the American experiment, an ongoing narrative-in-the making perhaps never more bombastic and perversely dramatic than in our current historical moment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Carmen Gillespie’s “recitatif” moves into the American spectacle/debacle, focusing in order to do so on the microcosm of Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello and giving voice to its haunted and haunting understory of racism, pretense, chauvinism, and varnished distortion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The book takes as its formal trope a musical “recitatif”—defined on Wikipedia as “a style of musical declamation that hovers between song and ordinary speech, particularly used for dialogic and narrative interludes during operas and oratories. An obsolete sense of the term was also ‘the tone or rhythm peculiar to any language.’”&nbsp; With its cast of five key players—Thomas Jefferson, his deceased wife Martha, his slave/mistress Sally Hemings, Sally’s mother Betty, and enslaved artisan/overseer Isaac Jefferson—and its program notes, overture, movements, intermission, and coda—the collection makes use of and subverts the traditional Western musical form, presenting voices vernacular, silenced, or otherwise suppressed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One suspects that Gillespie, in choosing her title, also had in mind Tony Morrison’s short story “Recitatif,” a tour de force tale of the fictions of memory and of parenthetical identity between orphan girls of different races.&nbsp; The genius of Gillespie’s book-length poem lies in the ways in which she manipulates refrain, rhyme, homonyms, punning, and other linguistic utterances to allow the identities of the powerful and the powerless to float over and turn into one another everywhere, in a frisson of ire, sympathy, and pathos.&nbsp; And while Thomas and Isaac punctuate the performance, both with a heavy dose of dramatic irony, it is the women in this performance—Sally, her mother, and Martha—whose overlapping voices, moving in threnody and counterpoint, form the beating heart of the recitatif.</p>
<p>Gillespie opens the book with “Program Notes” that consist of a found poem comprised of two side-by-side columns.&nbsp;&nbsp; The left is made of language from the actual&nbsp; “Monticello Digital Classroom—Reading Level:&nbsp; Elementary School” (“Thomas Jefferson was an incredible man” etc.) with the right-hand column offering a catalogue of parenthetical excerpts from <em>Jefferson’s Notes on the State of Virginia</em> (“. . . never yet could I find that a black had uttered a thought above the level of plain narration . . .”) as well as passages from more contemporary texts about Monticello and Jefferson.&nbsp;&nbsp; These introductory “notes” for Gillespie’s recitatif signal what to expect in the “performance” that follows:&nbsp; “plain narration,” often repetitive, in which meaning emerges from accrual, overlap, and the revelatory ironies of rhymes of all sorts—between words, between people, between circumstances.&nbsp; There are few words in the book, for example, that couldn’t be read and/or understood by a child or an illiterate person.&nbsp; Often the poems have the drive, swing, and encoded simplicity of field songs, spirituals, or prayers.&nbsp; Yet, juxtaposed and taken together, these utterances by the “ghosts of Monticello” add up to a stunning, compassionate picture that is both indicting and revelatory.</p>
<p>Isaac Jefferson, who dictated a memoir of his time at Monticello after he was freed, and Thomas Jefferson himself both left behind records of sorts, so particularly moving in Gillespie’s account are the voicings she gives to the <em>women</em> in her quartet—Betty (who was Sally Hemings’s enslaved mother but also the mistress of the father of Martha Jefferson, Thomas Jefferson’s wife—making Martha and Sally half-sisters, both probably nursed in infancy by Betty), and particularly Sally and Martha, both bound—in very different ways—by the strictures of their time and place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gillespie’s plain-spoken utterances, offered without editorializing or politicized rhetoric, offer a fiercely feeling look at the plight of the powerful and the powerless in the realm of Monticello, and, by extrapolation, America, as these lines from “Martha and Sally Chant” suggest:</p>
<blockquote><p>his slaves,<br />
his caprice,<br />
his possession</p>
<p>the U – S</p>
<p>and us.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here is a poem in Martha’s voice, spoken from the grave (Jefferson loved Martha; on her deathbed in her early 30s, she made Jefferson promise never to remarry.&nbsp; He never did, but he did have a life-long relationship afterward with his much younger slave, Sally Hemings, who, again, was Martha’s half-sister):</p>
<blockquote><p>No surprise, this familiar landscape,<br />
no escape to beyond, we are here.</p>
<p>No prologue, no Notes . . .<br />
We locked near can hear</p>
<p>for all the years<br />
just the beat of your lash</p>
<p>and the splash<br />
of the down low.</p>
<p>In this house where we laid,<br />
and, laid here, now we stay.</p>
<p>Bitter as roots do we stay,<br />
unafraid to parlay</p>
<p>the low down—</p>
<p>sound mocks the abyss,<br />
long prisoned unpromise—</p>
<p>How I hear?&nbsp; Can’t you hear?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sister, please re-enter here—</p></blockquote>
<p>From the beyond, Martha can finally speak (“unafraid to parlay”) of both the “down low” (what her family kept discreet) and the “low down” (the out-ed truth).&nbsp; In a poem of her own, “Sally Sings,” Hemings acknowledges this sister-rhyme, but also articulates its limits:</p>
<blockquote><p>Never odd nor even that is the breath of time.<br />
The windy voice of leaves in eaves speaks of ocean<br />
and tides wash the sand and rock the sand to rock.</p>
<p>What was is.&nbsp; What is was.<br />
Now—</p>
<p>What love, what word, what now, what song?<br />
What’s in the breath of time?&nbsp; Some wrong<br />
way along this stay.&nbsp; What is today?&nbsp; Where went yesterday?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This rhyme is mine, but not the song.</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps most moving are the poems in which both sisters speak in counterpoint, to and at one another, completing each other’s sentences and borrowing each other’s phrases from other poems, to striking effect:</p>
<p>This Familiar Landscape</p>
<blockquote><p>
SALLY:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No surprise, this familiar landscape.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No escape to beyond, we are here.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No prologue.&nbsp; No premier.&nbsp; We will hear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for all the years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, he was mine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and will be for all time.</p>
<p>MARTHA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this house where we laid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and where we were laid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all and each entwined<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and entombed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it seems we are each confined.</p>
<p>SALLY:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now as bitter roots we stay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>MARTHA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unafraid to delay what we know we must say—</p>
<p>SALLY:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a sweet sound mocks this abyss,</p>
<p>MARTHA: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so long delayed this prisoned unpromise.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In the poem’s antepenultimate poem, “Betty’s Chant,” the narrator looks into the future, admonishing anyone wrongly shackled or dehumanized to “run / out of the gate / it is not too late / to end your hundred years of wait&#8211; / Run.&nbsp; Keep the walk, your movement free / century by century.”&nbsp;&nbsp; One important take-away from this original, important sound act of history is expressed in a poem in which the walls of Monticello themselves speak:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Look around at what survives.&nbsp; I see.&nbsp; I see.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But oh, how then to be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; free?</p>
<p>Freed of what I know,<br />
what they have done,</p>
<p>from what they have sown.<br />
from what they still own.</p>
<p>from what they must own.&nbsp;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The stereoscopy of the phrases “still own” and “must own”—the pitch between wrongful possession and admitting and taking responsibility for that wrong—captures the inspiration and the ongoing lesson of <em>The Ghosts of Monticello</em>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This train is bound for glory, this train . . .<br />
</em>comes in the voices of fellowship<br />
from the Holiness Refuge Tabernacle<br />
on the Hill. Rooted in a road-side gully,<br />
a salt-loving wild morning glory<br />
has set out bearing crimson flowers.<br />
Leaves tremble in the trade wind, all notched<br />
like a hoof, or heart, the vine bound for<br />
the Great Salt Pond atop a dormant<br />
underground volcano. Runaway slaves<br />
were drowned there in chains, the pond<br />
a ledger in which the master entered<br />
profits and losses. Seeds float from the vine<br />
to live forever, returning faithfully<br />
to gullies and waste ground<br />
in spindrift blown from the pond.<br />
It’s the glory this train is bound for.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em> </em><em>-Catalpa speciosa</em></p>
<p>-March 26, 1951</p>
<p>How long have they idled, motor throttled<br />
down, off the two-track, at rest on snow-crust<br />
in his ’47 Dodge, its chrome bumper,<br />
its yellow fog lamps, facing the catalpa tree,<br />
the heater madly whirring against<br />
a night gone entirely cold?<br />
The man at the wheel is her first husband,<br />
the woman who will soon enough<br />
be my mother is seated beside his body,<br />
hand lifting to her lip-sticked mouth,<br />
the air in the Dodge so lit, fully blown<br />
of gun-powder, of sloe gin and cotton wadding,<br />
a waxy shell ejected, clattering<br />
against the right-side dash.<br />
She has bruised an ear drum, she says,<br />
from the blast of that .12 gauge, hammered<br />
flat at close range. This, the shock,<br />
her bedlamic shriek, will muddle her<br />
thoughts, make it hard to hear the coroner,<br />
to understand the parish priest,<br />
to weep sincerely, some whisper, until<br />
his baffled parents order a marker<br />
from the VFW, and drive back to Terre Haute.<br />
How did the pump-action shotgun,<br />
cut to riot-length, its butt at-rest<br />
in the rear foot-well, its coal-blue barrel<br />
angled at the driver’s side of the bench seat—<br />
go off? Who clicked three shells into the magazine,<br />
who racked the pump, and was the safety on?<br />
The detectives who rumble out, sirens<br />
wailing, from the far-off county seat,<br />
who swaddle her in wool blankets,<br />
who smoke Luckies and toe them deftly<br />
into the snow, who light-up her footprints<br />
with flashbulbs and prowl-car spots—<br />
they want only sensible geometry<br />
and a few hard facts, but she cannot say<br />
why her husband placed the shotgun like-so,<br />
why they idled, motor lowing, so long into the dark,<br />
why his cob-yellow brains and bits<br />
of seat-fluff stipple her tight pink sweater<br />
and the blown-out windshield, or why,<br />
high above them, the wintered seed pods<br />
of the catalpa tree—longish, thin,<br />
but for where the adamantine seeds swell<br />
the pods’ tobacco-brown casings—<br />
are splattered with the song-less tongue<br />
and silent lips of that long-rumored,<br />
half-hearted man.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are driving through our laments for<br />
what this town has become, almost lost though we turn</p>
<p>routes so familiar I hardly need to steer. The clubs gutted<br />
to build shops and chain restaurants, the all-night diner</p>
<p>where I once drank coffee and watched the world shrink into light<br />
a condo now, the bowling alley beside campus a Target</p>
<p>where students can buy gym shorts and toilet paper, all these lead<br />
to a recital of what stood in  each non-existent building</p>
<p>and remade space. Without speaking, we are steering out of town,<br />
along a two-lane road still robed in shade, trees pressed</p>
<p>close to the road’s blunt shoulder, lower limbs bend groundward<br />
like animals come to drink at an oasis. Then</p>
<p>the road widens and light splashes the asphalt, the wall of trees<br />
broken to reveal a cut clear, still littered with tree trunks</p>
<p>lying askew, broken limbs dangling, casualties of the ongoing battle<br />
between space and commerce. And beyond, houses, all twinned</p>
<p>in their sameness. I slow the car. No evidence anyone lives here.<br />
No one mowing or pulling weeds from beds uniformly mulched</p>
<p>in pine bark. No kids shooting baskets or riding bikes. My brother and<br />
his ex- dwelled for a while on a similar street. I had to count</p>
<p>doors to find their place. The fourth one on the left. Or maybe<br />
the sixth. When I moved here, this road was barely paved, a path</p>
<p>through trees, its few houses hidden by pin oak and pines. A good place<br />
to lead an invisible life. Now, slashes of orange paint color</p>
<p>the ground, sign that this road is due to be widened, repaved. A decade ago,<br />
when our daughter would only nap in the car, I would</p>
<p>drive this road and a maze of others, circling the satellite towns of<br />
the county before the bosses began building glass towers</p>
<p>that shine like new needles, even at might. Ground is broken, then come<br />
carpenters, masons, crane operators, craftsmen who will never</p>
<p>walk the rich carpets that will fill halls that exist only on paper now<br />
or “take a meeting” around tables as big as a front porch.</p>
<p>Then come computer jocks, software manipulators with their needs for<br />
Thai food, bike lanes, fair trade coffee. Now restaurants can</p>
<p>charge eighteen bucks for an appetizer. The bar where I got drunk for<br />
the last time is a lot loaded with earth movers now. Past the colony</p>
<p>of still-life houses, we see a mailbox, its top half crowned by the dome<br />
of a skull, the bottom adorned by jawbone, so opening the mailbox</p>
<p>offers the illusion of a skull yawning for reasons, both good and evil.<br />
In the side yard, a windmill, not built of angle iron, curved blades</p>
<p>dicing the wind, but something from a book a child reads, built of wood,<br />
its tiny windows leaded into diamond shapes. I’d call it</p>
<p>life-sized, but how many in recent years have seen such a thing?<br />
Let’s say it was large enough for its job. Which, right now, is</p>
<p>pulling our attention from the road as we slow and then pull over,<br />
the car slanted on a shallow ditch bank, our bodies still as the street</p>
<p>we just passed. No matter how motionless our bones, time continues<br />
its slow walk forward, stubborn as a morning runner who knows</p>
<p>the limits of his aging legs but keeps his dogged pace. Time will roll over<br />
all our wishes for the past to hold. We need to breathe deeply enough</p>
<p>to appreciate the allotment of days we treat like the abandoned houses<br />
of our youth, places to be occupied, then destroyed. Denied</p>
<p>a last drink, I stood outside the loud bar, emptied, feeling the start that would<br />
change. And keep changing. If this was a poem, if I was a wiser man,</p>
<p>I’d find some explanation for what it all means, lessons from a self-created<br />
Virgil or just myself in the guise of a man almost whole. But</p>
<p>I’m just a man sitting beside his wife, staring at something I’ll never have<br />
the patience or skill to make. Maybe once I would have bent close enough</p>
<p>to draw a brush over each plane of wood, coloring each ne to contrast<br />
its neighbors, each an irreplaceable part of the whole. The lie bosses tell</p>
<p>workers until they falter. But the windmill, with its ability to snare the eye<br />
echoes a more cautious time, when painting a structure or sanding</p>
<p>a piece of wood correctly meant something. While we stare, the eyes in the skull<br />
flash red, little hazard lights, a caution that someone is watching,</p>
<p>pulling us from what thickens in the capsule of our car: how easily we have<br />
dreamed ourselves into this place, a paradise artificial</p>
<p>as the new structures we curse but can’t stop from coming. We drive away,<br />
accelerating back into our lives, returning to our porch where we see</p>
<p>cranes above the trees, busy at the rebuilding there is no end of.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>But there is no crash or shatter.<br />
Only a hush, a slow rousing,<br />
the eider ducks’ merest mutterings.<br />
Light seeps into the sky</p>
<p>as though leaking from unfurled<br />
fingers, and here, delivered<br />
on an open palm, the bay against the sky<br />
a margin of incandescence.</p>
<p>One by one, larks vie<br />
for most intricate solo. An onshore wind,<br />
helping things along, articulates<br />
snaking ribbons of tidal current.</p>
<p>I, too, almost inexorably, start<br />
to move into morning tasks, projects<br />
I may not finish before this day’s lingering<br />
is extinguished. But how abrupt</p>
<p>the radio’s news reminds me<br />
that elsewhere on this insistent, revolving planet,<br />
one more war lifts its head, awakened<br />
or having never slept. In some other place,</p>
<p>in its morning’s first scattering light<br />
bereft of bird-song and leaf-toss,<br />
a village is blasted into rubble,<br />
and a soldier, too young to have to know</p>
<p>such despair, dodges crosshairs.<br />
A short while ago, he shrugged off half<br />
a moon. Now he goes down with half a face<br />
as all around him, day breaks.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>. . . if I find your grief exceeds due measure I shall be more greatly distressed than by the misfortune itself.    &#8212; Plutarch</p></blockquote>
<p>Upon learning of Timoxena’s death,<br />
unable to write her name until late<br />
in his letter, he asked his wife this favor:</p>
<p>Do not let your grief exceed due measure.<br />
Death is no more than one’s state before birth.<br />
There was no grief before our daughter came.<br />
Why should we grieve now that she is gone?<br />
All that has passed is a two-year life,<br />
eight seasons of small delights.<br />
Should such a gift be mourned?<br />
And a life so brief the soul lacked time<br />
to stiffen into a mold she would find<br />
difficult to shed. You ask me how<br />
one measures pain, how one bottles<br />
tides. Dear wife, this is virtue’s test.<br />
Let us grieve quietly, together, alone.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday afternoon, my wife taught me<br />
blueberry plants come with all the parts<br />
they need to bear fruit, both male and female.</p>
<p>To get one full of berries, though, you need<br />
to plant it right next to some blueberries<br />
from a different family. The only way they’ll fill</p>
<p>with blossoms and fruit is to cross pollinate.<br />
Swarms of bees bring the goods from one plant<br />
to the next, and the lot grow healthy and prosper.</p>
<p>Two plants, a small garden, and enough bees<br />
to outlast our dog’s urge to snap them<br />
out of the air as they fly from bloom to bloom.</p>
<p>Such a simple equation, this. So sensical<br />
that togetherness, time, and a little help<br />
will fill our bowls to overflowing.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As if the heart had turned coat<br />
and fisted herself into a knot,<br />
tightwadding breath, blocking off<br />
thought and the light in the kitchen, the road<br />
to the daughter’s house just down the way<br />
and the whole<br />
of the soft,<br />
soft morning in May.</p>
<p>As if the heart were a weapon formed<br />
against you, an enemy at the gate<br />
and not the lone runner from the outskirts<br />
bent under the weight, the gravity of the word<br />
she carried, collapsing at your back door,<br />
the body’s crumple the only<br />
word she can muster.<br />
As if she herself<br />
were not breaking.</p>
<p>As if she were not your own<br />
truest self, there in your kitchen in the morning,<br />
nor the open windows<br />
of your daughter’s house down the road.<br />
As if your heart were not, for you, the whole<br />
soft breath of May,<br />
and everything else<br />
of this world<br />
you’ve known along the way.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I live beneath the hawk untouched<br />
and bare, but sometimes it descends<br />
determined, wings spread.</p>
<p>Today I cut through a parking lot to follow it,<br />
walked along the pines beyond my neighborhood.<br />
I took my camera there.</p>
<p>It was as if it waited just for me,<br />
its feathers ruffled by the wind.<br />
I wanted to spread my hands and bury them</p>
<p>beneath the black and white and rust,<br />
a red-shouldered, the face so pleasing,<br />
I might have fallen in.</p>
<p>But the hawk’s eyes went bright,<br />
then locked, and when it flew,<br />
the man at the church across the lot</p>
<p>raised his dark arms.  <em>Did you get it?  Did you?<br />
</em>I lifted my camera and my pale hand,<br />
“Yes. Beautiful!” and turned.  I felt the river</p>
<p>between us, like a stream of hardship.<br />
We couldn’t see it, but it was there,<br />
and still we cheered.</p>
<p>Our voices signaled to the smaller birds<br />
tucked in the brush.  The hawk long gone,<br />
and as always everywhere.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Michael Bonacci died the night of the Father-Daughter Dinner Dance.&nbsp; He died at home in his bathroom.&nbsp; Technically, it was the next day.&nbsp; Like Cinderella, Michael might have joked, he expired just after midnight, his lungs filled, his heart aflutter, his mind plunged into the cold black expanse.</p>
<p>He was sober when he got up that morning at five. &nbsp;He walked in the dark to the bathroom, feeling his left hand out for the door frame, then the wall, then the light switch that he did not turn on because his wife was sleeping. &nbsp;By five thirty, he sat in one of the club chairs in his study, feet off the floor and tucked, arms resting in his lap, counting breaths. &nbsp;He started over when he got to ten, beginning to let go. &nbsp;Then, for the fifth time that week, he was interrupted by the paper woman’s headlights. &nbsp;They spoiled the darkness, sliding along his study wall, slowly at first, and then quickly as the white hatchback passed and the high beams flashed across his face.&nbsp; It was annoying to him that after a year and a half, she still paused in front of houses that had never received the paper.</p>
<p>Michael was at the window when the woman drove back around from the end of the cul-de-sac, snailing past each house. &nbsp;A deep manvoice exuded from the hatchback and drifted over his lawn, past the tired maple, reaching his ear as an undertow of chopped sound. &nbsp;She was probably in her late sixties, drove through their neighborhood on the wrong side of the road each morning, paused often to study what must have been a list of addresses written with a shaky hand.&nbsp; Even after her car passed and was no longer visible, her brake lights dashed any hope of recovering his meditation.&nbsp; Michael shook his head and felt old frustrations rising.&nbsp; Better to have a fresh-faced kid, like it used to be, he thought, beating down the street on a bike, pitching the morning papers for strikes, the large canvas strap of the bag full of news slung diagonally across his chest, maybe a baseball cap turned backwards so the wind wouldn’t blow it off.&nbsp; One nickel in his pocket for every dollar tossed.&nbsp; It struck him as he stood there that he had not seen a paperboy in twenty years.&nbsp; Where had they all gone?&nbsp; His thoughts went back to the old woman who drove the paper route in her used car.&nbsp; She looked to be in her late sixties and was driving every morning in the dark before the crack of dawn.&nbsp; She could not keep her houses straight, she delivered a dying medium, and she worked a job once reserved for kids.</p>
<p>Michael’s annoyance transferred from the paper woman to the circumstances that he started imagining had brought her to his neighborhood each morning in the twilight of her life.&nbsp; Then he noticed himself in the reflection of the window as the red afterglow disappeared. &nbsp;He had lost fifteen pounds during the first thirty days of sobriety in a combination of exercise and abstinence. &nbsp;Today was day number forty.&nbsp; He left the window and went to find his running shoes, thinking about himself and where he fell on the line between the paperboys and the old woman.&nbsp; I am an old woman, he thought and laughed at himself, remembering those words from a John Prine song, though the name of the song escaped him at the moment.</p>
<p>As he stooped to tie his shoes, his mind already was racing again, and he thought about whether he was going to have a drink at the dinner dance that night. &nbsp;He pictured the drink, the martini glass filled with ice cubes bathed in water to chill while the gin was poured into a silver shaker, more ice packed, shaken hard and carefully set aside, the ice water emptied from the martini glass, and then the smooth pour, the gin chilled so that it seems to stack along the slanted sides of the glass almost like shaved-ice slush, until it filled from the bottom and the last drops were coaxed out by the bartender’s smooth tapping finger, the final fat olive speared and perched toward on the rim, a whisper of vermouth creating a liquid plume in the near-frozen gin.</p>
<p>A week or two ago, Michael’s wife had suggested a journal to help with the anger that came on when he quit. Her therapist recommended journaling, she said. It was the opposite of what you assumed, he thought. When he drank, he felt warm and content, not violent. But the edge was there when he was sober; he felt that nobody listened unless he yelled. &nbsp;When he was drunk, he didn’t care if anyone listened or not.&nbsp; Write about that, his wife suggested the morning after they argued deep into the night and he had thrown the coffee grinder to make a point, cracking the plastic.&nbsp; Michael hated the idea of fixating on himself in writing, scribbling like some mad man under the glow of an electric lamp, the scratch of the pen feeling all wrong and akin to crumpled paper. &nbsp;But he had started the argument that night and she left a journal and a blue ink pen beside a note in the kitchen. He decided he would not write about himself, but set out to write bad poetry.</p>
<p>“What did the Bard write when he retired down at that river town?” Michael wrote one morning.&nbsp; “What did he read if he could not read his own Upon Avon?”</p>
<p>He continued:</p>
<p>Imagine long walks,<br />
Perhaps with a cane, perhaps<br />
With a wife, or a dashing young boy,<br />
Lean and willing, but writing nothing, playing nothing, keeping up with precisely<br />
Nothing.<br />
Painful to remain silent and be thought the fool,<br />
He remembered, than to speak and,<br />
Without regret, remove all doubt droll-fully.</p>
<p>Bad poetry helped. It was like betting against your favorite team. &nbsp;You could not lose. &nbsp;If they lost, you won. &nbsp;If they won, you didn’t care that you lost. &nbsp;Bad poetry had saved him once before. &nbsp;Just out of college, his first job since working construction in summers, he lived at the end of a hall of tenth grade boys in a dorm at a New England boarding school, a teaching fellow. &nbsp;His window overlooked a small mound with a circle of green saplings, a hedgerow, and a boundary of older trees that lined a gravel lane connecting the campus to a cornfield. &nbsp;He could see a portion of one of the fields in the distance through the gap the road created.&nbsp; He arrived on campus at the end of summer when the corn had not yet been harvested and the sky stirred pungent with moisture in the late afternoons.</p>
<p>Michael ran, sometimes, down the gravel lane that swung through the farmer’s fields and around the farmhouse and emerged eventually on the state highway a mile or so north of campus. &nbsp;From there, he could double back, which he often did, or if he was feeling adventurous and strong, which he started to feel in full autumn when the football conference games arrived and the charter buses rumbled through campus to tour the fall foliage, then he would cross the highway and venture on the trails that zigzagged across the mountains, foothills really, and old logging roads that were maintained more or less for hikers and runners and snow mobiles and, he assumed, the late winter assault on the maple trees for sap when snow still covered the ground.</p>
<p>These trails were steep and upkeep varied. &nbsp;Somehow he felt he could run farther when the terrain was unstable and he was forced to concentrate not on whether he had run a mile or more, but whether he was putting his foot in the right location, whether the rock was going to slide, whether the leaves covered a hole or something else tricky to traverse, whether a branch was going to slap him in the face. &nbsp;Time warped on the mountain trails, the sunlight became something tangible, stabbing through the autumn leaves, catching the tree dust and suspended woodland air that he could not see, but that seemed thick until a gust of wind swept through and swirled it clean. &nbsp;He wrote a bad poem about this. &nbsp;He wrote bad poetry about his students, his college girlfriend, his terrible JV soccer team, his morning commute on foot across the campus from his dorm near the river to the main buildings, over the field where ice formed on a foot of snow so that it bruised his shins when his feet busted through the crusted layer.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>On the morning of the day Michael died, he wrote a bad poem about a door that was carved and hung for the first time on a New England home in 1797. &nbsp;“There is something that doesn’t love a door,” he began. &nbsp;Then he turned his attention to the azalea bush outside of his study windows, thriving in the humid city he had migrated to shortly after law school. &nbsp;The bush had been anemic all fall, just beyond the shade of the maple, barely getting enough to drink.</p>
<p>The sprinkler system needed an update. &nbsp;A pipe, he thought, must have split somewhere under his yard, out of sight, pressure released, system fail. &nbsp;But the bush held despite a few mornings where it looked brittle, sapped, and tired. &nbsp;There had been rain that winter, a small flood, and general dampness into the New Year. &nbsp;The bush revived. By mid- February, the bush had leaves and during a few days of eighty-degree weather, unseasonably hot in February by historic measures, even for Houston, the bush grew buds and one of those buds even flowered into delicate white, tissue-like pedals.</p>
<p>His wife would find the poem several weeks after his death. &nbsp;She would read it once, misunderstand the triggers, find meaning where there was none, and save the notebook for the remainder of her long life, even after she remarried and moved east for her second husband’s career on Capitol Hill, even after he, too, died and she moved back to Texas where she had been born and was raised and where she still had a few old friends to talk to on the patio of the old club where the grandkids could order Shirley Temples and she could enjoy the sound of babies with their mothers.&nbsp; She would not remember the bruises on shins from ice in spring.&nbsp; She would not recall the smell of the mountain laurel on those long, crisp afternoons amid the buckets that were nailed to the trees like suckling tin dolls to gather the oozing sap that yet was weeks away.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Michael started his run with the memory of those New England jogs still fresh in his mind and his bad poetry safely tucked in his study drawer. &nbsp;He knew the club would look perfect for the dinner dance that evening. &nbsp;The uniformed men waiting at the valet, the sweep of stair, the bone white columns, the intimate foyer where some would mingle and greet, cocktail in hand, waiter and waitress staff gliding with small round trays of wine, beef tartar on crusty baguette slices, escargot. &nbsp;Through the open double doors into the grand ballroom, the big band would be poised and the polished wooden floors would glow beneath the crystal chandeliers ready for light and festive feet.&nbsp; The men would wear white tie, their daughters, semi-ball gowns.&nbsp; If he chose, it would be his first drink in forty days.</p>
<p>Michael recalled the first time he had inhaled wealth, back east—a towel of all things, thick and luxurious. &nbsp;He had stayed with an aunt who was not rich but who lived in a resort community while her husband struggled as an architect.&nbsp; The aunt and uncle had access to a club through his university. &nbsp;They took Michael to the resort on his uncle’s days off. &nbsp;The towels were at the entrance. &nbsp;They were stacked, ten high and three rows back, on a low shelf beneath the shade of a cabana. &nbsp;Michael reached for one, noticing nothing else until he heard a clicking tongue, and looked up to see a boy, just a year or two older, forming a big, wide grin. &nbsp;The older boy held out an identical towel from another stack, this one beside a director’s chair where the boy was perched. &nbsp;Michael felt himself flush beneath the boy’s gaze. &nbsp;Unlike the summer pool back home, this place was quiet. &nbsp;There was no off-the-reservation laughter, no country music piped in from suspended speakers, no mother shouting for her child to come on back and get some sunscreen on before he turned lobster—just the cool, soft-spoken hush of wealth.</p>
<p>Michael nodded at the boy as he took the towel, feeling its weight, sensing the boy watching him and passing through the gaze to the other side, where the spell was snapped as quickly as it had arrived, first by his uncle who mocked one of the sunbathing men wearing a gold chain, and then by his aunt who followed, a bit overweight, a bit underdressed, and laughing a bit too loud at his uncle’s crooked smiles.</p>
<p>His aunt and uncle ordered Old Fashioneds poolside. &nbsp;The name seemed perfect to Michael when he saw them, the cherry lodged in maple-colored crystal like a mosquito caught in amber from one of the National Geographic magazines his grandparents subscribed to him.</p>
<p>Only one way to go, Michael thought, remembering his aunt and uncle, their white skin and floppy hats, their short limbs reclining in the sun, the umbrella, never quite perched in the right location to protect all the three vitals—their bodies, their drinks, their beach bag that looked more like a canvas grocery sack. &nbsp;And so the drinks remained shaded, cool, iced, and well-tended by the young waiters who strolled from umbrella to umbrella, chair to chair, group to group.&nbsp; And the beach bags faded and Michael got his first bad sunburn of his life that he could recall.</p>
<p>Bad Poem, No. 34 By Michael</p>
<p>Late autumn days when the Pilgrims recalled the harvest,<br />
The Pequot raced for game, and signs of winter torched the breeze<br />
That slightly sounded so all could see that summer’s laze had shrunk.<br />
Down here, winter’s hints, they never come. The breeze it flies<br />
From the Gulf that is thick with preludes, grand storms, salt<br />
To delta mud, like whiskey, heat so thick it coats the gravy sky.</p>
<p>After his run, wet with sweat, Michael walked back to his bedroom where his wife was still laying down. &nbsp;One of the children, their youngest, had made his way from his bed to theirs, and was snoozing with his worn, stuffed elephant, his fingers in his mouth, always two fingers rather than a thumb. &nbsp;She was reading a novel, a paperback with seashells on the cover that her sister had discarded. &nbsp;&nbsp;On his side of the bed, magazines were stacked, a measure of the months, dusty to the touch perhaps, but not visibly. &nbsp;There was something slightly worn about the magazines, so different from when each arrived, as if pressed, smooth, and surprising. &nbsp;By the bed, they were picked over and smudged.&nbsp; He headed for the shower.</p>
<p>From the time he took a shower until lunch when he ate a hotdog with his daughter and his son at Weenie Stand Number Three, Michael moved through his punch list of odd jobs around the house. &nbsp;The garage door opener needed a new fuse. &nbsp;The hole that the dog had dug and that Michael had filled with sand and dirt and planted with grass was, by some great mystery, a hole again. &nbsp;The sprinkler system needed to be repaired to ensure the survival of the azalea bush so that it, in turn, could inspire more bad poetry. &nbsp;He completed exactly none of those tasks, but managed to read an article about the mathematical connection between the mating rituals of rabbits, the syllables in Sanskrit poetry, and the shape of his ears. &nbsp;In reality, Michael was just biding his time until his wife got back from the morning basketball games with the kids so that he could escape with them from the house for hotdogs and the park.</p>
<p>“Why do you put coleslaw on your hotdog?” his daughter asked. “That’s disgusting.”</p>
<p>“That’s the only way to eat a hotdog,” he answered.</p>
<p>She looked at him and sighed, and he thought how it was just recently that she had learned to sigh.&nbsp; It wasn’t clear to him whether she had mastered it, though she seemed to have innate talent.</p>
<p>“Sometimes,” he said, “I put chili on it, and relish, too.”</p>
<p>“That’s really disgusting,” she said and bit into her own hotdog, dressed only in ketchup.</p>
<p>They went to a park near their house. &nbsp;Thirty years earlier, the land had been a vast field and men sometimes walked with dogs and shotguns to hunt dove or quail.&nbsp; He thought about this as he sat on a bench, watching his son run around a playhouse, pausing every now and then to pick up an armful of wood chips that carpeted the area and throw them in the air, laughing.&nbsp; His daughter played on a seesaw with a girl half her age, gently pushing the plank up for the girl whose legs did not reach the ground, even on the downside.</p>
<p>The park stretched out toward a block of houses, clipped grass and a few trees here and there.&nbsp; There was a baseball diamond at the far end, a basketball court, and a pair of tennis courts where neighborhood kids met private coaches to practice their serves. &nbsp;On days when the wind blew in from the Gulf or down from the high plains with nothing to stop it save the neighborhoods that circled outward like a snail shell, people would fly kites in the outfield of the baseball diamond. &nbsp;He always thought it was a great idea when he saw it, but he had never done it.&nbsp; He had never gone to the store to buy a kite.&nbsp; Where would one even find a good kite that was made of something real, not cheap plastic that got twisted and torn? He wasn’t sure. &nbsp;That afternoon, there were no kites. &nbsp;The air was still, the sky cloudless. &nbsp;Tomorrow, he thought, he would buy a kite for when the wind next blew.</p>
<p>Looking out at the playing fields, Michael tried to imagine the farmland that once dominated. &nbsp;He imagined his grandfather, a retired veteran who had spent his last thirty years hunting dove in cornfields in Virginia and North Carolina, set up in a blind with his retriever darting out for a fallen bird after the crack of the shotgun blast.&nbsp; He could not imagine it.</p>
<p>Instead, he recalled a moment when he was a boy with his grandfather, laying in the back seat of his grandfather’s diesel Volkswagen Rabbit. &nbsp;The morning began with frost and Michael recalled watching his grandfather turn the key in one direction to heat the coil and then turn the key the other direction to start the engine in a guttural sigh.&nbsp; The blast of air turned to heat by the time they drove along the ocean front avenue toward the road that lead out of town.</p>
<p>“I’m tired,” Michael’s son said, a streak of mud across his cheek and a bit of snot caked around his nostrils.</p>
<p>“Do you want to go home and take a nap?” Michael asked, stooping to wipe the kids face with general movements.</p>
<p>“No nap!” the boy said and ran off, making his way toward the jungle gym until he tripped on something invisible and started crying, a few wood chips stuck to his face.</p>
<p>Michael called to his daughter.&nbsp; It was time to go.</p>
<p>In the bathroom, an hour before the dinner dance was set to begin, Michael shaved. &nbsp;He had been careless and the water from his shower had pooled on the hard tile floor.&nbsp; It was slick, but he did not have time to mop it up with a towel.&nbsp; His daughter showered in a separate bathroom and worked with his wife to comb her hair and put on her new, white dress. &nbsp;They met in the hallway, she did a self-conscious twirl and he laughed, hugged her, kissed her forehead.&nbsp; The front porch light was on, the night was warm but with a breeze that promised kite-flying weather in the morning.&nbsp; The moon was oblong and hanging high in the sky. &nbsp;He placed his arm around his daughter’s shoulder.&nbsp; They made their way down the footpath, away from home, her smile anticipating dinner and dancing and friends amid the live oaks and beneath the shimmering lights of chandeliers that held at bay the black night sky.</p>
