					<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed reading this as it brought back fond memories of the time that I spent at summer camp at Rock Point as a young girl.  It was for girls only and we stayed in the main house in large dorms that we shared with 3 others and had wonderful meals in the dining room.  We also made lanyards out of those plastic strings.  I was a member of St. Paul&#039;s Church and in a girl&#039;s club called GFS - Girl&#039;s Friendly Society.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just read &quot;Swallows&quot; and thought it remarkable in its narrative simplicity.  You certainly imagine Claire Wilson (and Hazel Hicks) unforgettably for your readers.  This line, and others, triggered my remembrance of remarks that David made about spending time with his grandchildren during our conversation in the car on the last poker night: &quot;I would teach children about the age of these campers, and I would try to find opportunities for them to witness the extraordinary events that sometimes happen in ordinary settings.&quot;]]></description>
