					<description><![CDATA[On rereading the poem I am struck and moved by the similarities with Virginia Woolf&#039;s To the Lighthouse.  That novel concludes with near-sighted artist Lily Briscoe, after much reminiscing and re-imagining, finally completing her painting, a painting that recovers from the ashes of history not only the moments of joy and the power of grief, but also endows meaning to the Ramsay family life. Sarah Gordon&#039;s poem attains a parallel artistic accomplishment.  Her recovery of just the right detail phrased with just the right words in just the right order shows there is such a thing as &quot;graceful retrieval&quot; after all. As the poem empties a life it fills it as well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wonderful, wonderful poem, moving and profound. Many of us of a certain age (I&#039;m 85) will find this poem expressing what we think and feel in quiet moments of reflection--our lives mostly behind us, scattered pieces of memory, loss, and meaning that don&#039;t quite fit together--except in this poem. This is the poem I have been looking for for the past ten years.]]></description>
