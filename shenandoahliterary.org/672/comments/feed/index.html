					<description><![CDATA[On rereading the poem I am struck and moved by the similarities with Virginia Woolf&#039;s To the Lighthouse.  That novel concludes with near-sighted artist Lily Briscoe, after much reminiscing and re-imagining, finally completing her painting, a painting that recovers from the ashes of history not only the moments of joy and the power of grief, but also endows meaning to the Ramsay family life. Sarah Gordon&#039;s poem attains a parallel artistic accomplishment.  Her recovery of just the right detail phrased with just the right words in just the right order shows there is such a thing as &quot;graceful retrieval&quot; after all. As the poem empties a life it fills it as well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wonderful, wonderful poem, moving and profound. Many of us of a certain age (I&#039;m 85) will find this poem expressing what we think and feel in quiet moments of reflection--our lives mostly behind us, scattered pieces of memory, loss, and meaning that don&#039;t quite fit together--except in this poem. This is the poem I have been looking for for the past ten years.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Captures well the irony of the concurrence of things, uncorrelated joys and tragedies along with the mundane all observing the same clock tick.  Nice sense of form to accentuate the sense of poetic experience.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love the thought, sounds, and presentation of this poem.  Is there such a word as sensical?  I don’t care, just couldn’t resist asking.  Write on, Jack!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed reading this as it brought back fond memories of the time that I spent at summer camp at Rock Point as a young girl.  It was for girls only and we stayed in the main house in large dorms that we shared with 3 others and had wonderful meals in the dining room.  We also made lanyards out of those plastic strings.  I was a member of St. Paul&#039;s Church and in a girl&#039;s club called GFS - Girl&#039;s Friendly Society.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just read &quot;Swallows&quot; and thought it remarkable in its narrative simplicity.  You certainly imagine Claire Wilson (and Hazel Hicks) unforgettably for your readers.  This line, and others, triggered my remembrance of remarks that David made about spending time with his grandchildren during our conversation in the car on the last poker night: &quot;I would teach children about the age of these campers, and I would try to find opportunities for them to witness the extraordinary events that sometimes happen in ordinary settings.&quot;]]></description>
