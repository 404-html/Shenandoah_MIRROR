<em> <span class="s1">to catch hold of the subjects beyond our reach</span></em><br />
<span class="s1"> &#8211;Julia Hartwig, “Meditation (On Czeslaw Milosz)”</span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>My favorite literary feud came to its moment of crisis in 1979, in an interview that took place with the novelist and essayist Mary McCarthy on Dick Cavett’s talk show. Cavett, a comic with intellectual pretentions, had an easy-going quality that belied his ability to entice guests into saying snarky or outrageous things. Is there any writer of your generation you regard as over-rated? asked Cavett of his guest. McCarthy’s answer: Lillian Hellman.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Every word she writes is a lie, including ‘the’ and ‘and.’”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>1<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At that time the two writers had been battling one another for years, originally because of politics: in the 1930s, Hellman was a Stalinist, McCarthy a Trotskyite. But the causes of their disdain for one another also surely had to do with professional jealousy&#8211;McCarthy apparently resented Hellman’s financial success: her plays and their movie adaptations brought in a lot of bucks. Hellman seems to have longed for McCarthy’s reputation as a Serious Intellectual, something Hellman was not. Mind you, Hellman seems to have indeed had a bit of a problem with the truth. Her best-selling memoir, <i>Pentimento</i>, tells us that in the 1930s she undertook a dangerous mission to Berlin, carrying a big wad of cash in her pillbox hat, money destined for the Anti-Hitler resistance. (In the movie adaptation of the book, Jane Fonda plays Hellman, sporting a very stylish fur pillbox hat.) The mission was supposedly arranged by Hellman’s friend “Julia”&#8211;a member of the resistance. And Hellman tells us that for various reasons she cannot identify Julia by her real name, even though the book was published in 1973, when the only remaining Nazi higher-ups were either in Spandau Prison or donning wigs and fake beards in Paraguay and Argentina. In all likelihood, Julia never existed, though Hellman seems to have based the Julia character on a real life American spy, Muriel Gardiner, who she never met. Hellman reacted to McCarthy’s putdown by slapping her, Dick Cavett, and PBS (which aired the Cavett show), with a 2.5 million dollar lawsuit that wound its way through the courts for a good many years, until finally being dropped by her heirs after Hellman’s death. I’m attracted to this particular literary spat in part because McCarthy’s putdown is so deliciously merciless. But I am also drawn to it for nostalgic reasons. Mary McCarthy knew a liar when she saw one, and was willing to stick to her guns in defending her statement, at a huge financial cost, and in what turned out to also be a terrific strain on her health. And McCarthy furthermore knew that if someone lies about one thing, that person is likely to lie about others. Truth is good and lies are bad, and, incidentally, a pattern of falsehood makes for bad writing.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>As evidence to this latter claim, we need only look at the Tweets that are tapped out by the tiny little thumbs of our current president. Shortly after his election, the website <i>PolitiFact </i>asserted that on the campaign trail an astonishing 70% of Donald Trump’s statements were falsehoods, 26 % misleading half-truths, and only 4% legitimate truths.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>2 <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And of course the lies are not just outrageous, they are uttered with a doltish bellicosity, and with the intention to dismiss any statements which disagree with his own as “fake news” generated by the liberal elites and the media.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is exactly the sort of divisiveness that allows those forces which support Trump&#8211;be they Breitbart, Fox, or White House advisor Kellyanne Conway yammering on about “alternative facts”&#8211;to peddle falsehoods as truth, false equivalencies as credible analogies, and wacko conspiracy theories as plausible and worthy of investigation. Not too many years ago, Stephen Colbert lampooned this indifference to factuality by calling it “truthiness,” but now the jargon is moving in a more ominous direction that isn’t funny at all. In 2016 the Oxford Dictionary named “post-truth” as its Word of the Year. The word’s definition: </span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s3">“adjective. Relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.” 3</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>Given this state of affairs, it’s not surprising that the science fiction writer Philip K. Dick has in recent years come to seem less like a journeyman who cranked out fodder for the pulps and more like a prophet. And, given his penchant for psychedelics and speed, he might rightly be described as a prophet of the “wild-eyed” variety.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not long before his death in 1982, Dick relocated to Orange County, just down the road from Knott’s Berry Farm, Disneyland, and the birthplace of that most storied of nutcase organizations, the John Birch Society. There he wrote a screed that Kurt Anderson&#8211;in a singularly distressing analysis of the paranoid strain in American culture entitled <i>Fantasyland: How America Went Haywire: A 500 Year History&#8211; </i>describes as Dick’s<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“perfect summary of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>his dread about the transformation of American society and culture as the real and the unreal become indistinguishable.”4 Anderson quotes from this document at length, as well he should:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">We have fiction mimicking truth and truth mimicking fiction. We have a dangerous overlap, a dangerous blur. And in all probability it is not deliberate. In fact, that is part of the problem&#8230;.The problem is a real one, not an intellectual game. Because today we live in a society in which spurious realities are manufactured by the media, by governments, by big corporations, by religious groups, political groups—and the electronic hardware exists by which to deliver these pseudo-worlds right into the heads of the reader, the viewer, the listener.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And it is an astonishing power: that of creating whole universes, universes of the mind. I ought to know. I do the same thing. It is my job to create universes.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I consider that the matter of defining what is real—that is a serious topic, even a vital topic. And in there somewhere is the other topic, the definition of the authentic human. Because the bombardment of pseudo-realities begins to produce inauthentic humans very quickly, spurious humans—as fake as the data pressing at them from all sides. Fake realities will create fake humans. Or, fake humans will generate fake realities, and then sell them to other humans, turning them, eventually, into forgeries of themselves. So we wind up with fake humans inventing fake realities and then peddling them to other fake humans. It is just a very large version of Disneyland.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>5</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Around the very same time that Dick penned these words, the French post-structuralist philosopher Jean Baudrillard was at work on his maddeningly ponderous but equally prophetic tome, <i>Simulacra and Simulation. </i>For Baudrillard, the problem is even more dire. It is not simply that fake realities are indistinguishable from the real: we have instead arrived at a cultural juncture in which, wittingly or unwittingly, we have come to see the fakery as <i>more</i> real than what is authentic. Early in the volume he says this: “It is no longer a question of imitation, nor duplication, nor even parody. It is a question of substituting the signs of the real for the real&#8230;Never again will the real have a chance to produce itself—such is the vital function of the model in a system of death, or rather of anticipated resurrection, that no longer even gives the event of death a chance. A hyperreal henceforth sheltered from the imaginary, and from any distinction between the real and the imaginary, leaving room only for the orbital recurrence of models and for the simulated generation of differences.” 6<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our new era of the hyperreal not only blunts our ability to distinguish truth from lie, it also lobotomizes the notions which those of us with artistic temperaments hold so dear—mimesis, creativity, idealism. Baudrillard’s forebears, fellow mandarin philosophes such as Roland Barthes and Michel Foucault, giddily announced that the author was dead. Baudrillard goes them one better: now it is the imagination itself which has bitten the dust. Now that the eon of the hyperreal has dawned, will we ever be able to again recognize that which is real, or, as artists, produce works that are <i>akin </i>to the real, works that express that mysterious mimetic acuity which has traditionally been one of the principle consolations that characterize the creative process?</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>And during a time when the very notion that art can offer consolation has come to seem quaint, a vestige of the Victorians and the more churchy versions of the High Modernists, the search for such consolation can be slantwise, circuitous and fraught. Not long ago I spent a snowbound Saturday afternoon with my teenage sons, watching Ridley Scott’s masterly 1982 film, <i>Blade Runner, </i>one of many cinematic adaptations of Philip K. Dick’s novels, in this case the woefully entitled <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? </i>The boys had not seen the film before, but they had recently seen its deeply flawed sequel, </span><span class="s4">Denis Villeneuve’</span><span class="s1">s <i>Blade Runner 2049. </i> Both films posit a future in which various models of androids called “replicants” have been manufactured by a sinister multinational corporation. The replicants, identical to actual humans in almost every respect—save that they possess superhuman strength&#8211;are menials and slaves. The males are sent to off-world mining colonies to do work too perilous for actual humans; the females must labor in off-world brothels. But certain models of the replicants have a tendency to malfunction; they decide return to earth incognito, and to pass as real humans. This is relatively easy for them to do: each replicant has an individual physiology, and each has been programed to believe at least in some degree that it is a human and not a machine. They have been programmed with childhood memories, and been issued small caches of photographs from made-up pasts. They require nothing more elaborate, for each of them is also programmed to break down—to crash like a computer—five years after it has been manufactured. The nominal hero of the film, Rick Deckard, played by Harrison Ford, is a Blade Runner, whose job is to retire (or kill, if you’re of an anthropomorphic bent) reprobate replicants. His job is far from easy, and has been made more so at the time the film begins. The androids have begun to stage an outright rebellion against their human masters, and are led by an especially charismatic replicant named Roy Batty, played by the Dutch actor Rutger Hauer. The film becomes a cat and mouse game between Roy, as he attempts to gather converts to his rebellion, and Deckard, as he tries to capture Roy and retire him. The plot is a gorgeous mish-mash, part hard-boiled detective story in the mode of John Huston, part Kubrick’s <i>Spartacus. </i>Set in a dystopian Los Angeles where it is perpetually raining,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>where the streets and buildings are gaudy and trashy, and lit by garish signage that evokes a futuristic Times Square or Piccadilly Circus, the film is always visually stunning—and the sets have a palpable quality that the computerized willfulness of the sequel cannot match. The film’s climax is a lengthy fight scene between Deckard and Roy, whose rebellion against the humans has come close to being successful. Roy has assassinated the head of the multinational and creator of the replicants, and thus Roy’s de facto father. But Roy’s time of obsolescence is approaching. He is about to crash, and Deckard’s task is to draw out their battle to the point that he can outlast Roy. It’s an eerie sci-fi prizefight, taking place in the upper floors and roof of an abandoned hotel. As Roy nears the end of his existence, the dialogue is wholly his. While Deckard simply groans as his bones get broken—here we’re reminded, not that we needed to be, of Harrison Ford’s limitations as an actor—Roy declaims one of those brink-of-death speeches you find in the fifth acts of Jacobean dramas. There’s some Shakespeare here, and a good bit of John Webster. But then it dawns on us: as Roy’s end approaches and as he continues to speechify, we realize that Scott’s inspiration is neither Philp K. Dick, nor <i>Spartacus</i>, nor <i>The Maltese Falcon</i>. It is Milton’s <i>Paradise Lost, </i>specifically <i>Paradise Lost</i> as viewed by the romantics, where Satan is a tragic hero. In fact, as Hauer’s Roy stands naked before the camera, his white skin glowing opalescent against the background of the rain, his stance is identical to that of Blake’s famous watercolor of Milton’s Satan. (Scott is a sucker for this sort of quotation from art history: his first film, <i>The Duelists</i>, is set during the Napoleonic wars, and its backgrounds scrupulously reference the moody fog-bound landscapes of the German Romantic painter Caspar David Frederich.) At this point in the film, we must radically reconfigure our assumptions: Roy and his fellow replicants are the real heroes of the story, who, by expressing their old-fangled revolutionary longings&#8211;aspiring to Liberty, Equality, Fraternity&#8211;are more authentically human than their makers. This theme also figures in </span><span class="s4">Villeneuve’</span><span class="s1">s sequel to <i>Blade Runner</i>, though as kitsch rather than as tragedy: Ryan Gosling’s doe-eyed replicant protagonist is singularly un-Miltonic. Instead, he’s Pinocchio, longing to be a real boy. Scott’s <i>Blade Runner</i> is a remarkable accomplishment and at an advance screening of it described in Lawrence Sutton’s biography of Dick, the writer heaped effusive praise on Scott. 7 The film, he said, was the most successful adaption of one of his books that he could possibly have imagined. The pair then posed for a publicity photo. Dick died of a stroke not long after the event. Scott, for his part, has confessed that he never finished the novel the film was based upon. 8 </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>As the credits of the film began to roll on the DVD, I tried in the least lofty terms I could muster to explain to my sons about why Scott’s <i>Blade Runner</i> is superior to its sequel. But they were having none of it. Why? Because the special effects of Scott’s film make it look so dated and “retro,” a word they used with special disdain. As the DVD was ejected, they immediately picked up their phones to text or Snapchat. I came to suspect that to dwell in Baudrillard’s Eon of the Hyperreal was perfectly ok with them.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>Where does this state of things leave poetry and poets, practitioners of an art that is vastly more retro than a 35-year-old sci fi film? There are various camps of poets who would insist that our condition of Hyperreality should suit us just fine. The Language Poets began to say this forty-odd years ago. Let’s just enjoy the new status quo, they say. This way we can abandon entirely the notion that selves write poems, for the very concept of selfhood is a quaint delusion. And for more “mainstream” readers who crave something like a “sincere” and good-for-you-in-an-oat bran-way traditional lyric, there’s always the cult of Mary Oliver, whose assembly line epiphanies may as well have been outsourced and produced in various factories in China. (Although, to their credit, the readers of Mary Oliver seem to deeply crave encounters with poetic authenticity.) Where can we look to find a poetry that speaks against Hyperrality and for a recognition of that deeply endangered condition, Plain Old Reality? Though I would hasten to add that reality is never plain, and never easy to glimpse or engage—or to dwell in for more than an instant. This is the message of one of Wallace Stevens’ very last poems, written in the early 1950s, when he knew that his cancer was terminal. You may have already guessed the title I am referring to—“Reality is an Activity of the Most August Imagination.” It’s an uncharacteristic poem for Stevens, as it seems based on an honest-to-God <i>event—</i>some people are driving at night, “from Cornwall to Hartford.” The speaker finds himself entranced by the sights he views from the car window, though he hastens to add that they are blurred and occluded, not like “a night blown at a glassworks in Vienna or Venice,” but instead “a grinding going round/under the front of the western evening star.” There seems to be nothing “lyric” here, nothing sublime. Yet the speaker hastens to insist that the sublime is <i>in there</i>, if only as glimpsed for a fraction of a second before it retreats: “The vigor of glory, a glittering in the veins,/As things emerged and moved and were dissolved.” 9 It’s an “insolid billowing of the solid.” But if you are vigilant, if you look with the proper fixity, the solid can be abstracted, reality can be seen, if only insofar as we can recognize that it is continually elusive, continually in flux. And, yes, you need an august imagination to make such a reckoning, one that we are untrained for during a time when we’d prefer to scroll through our phones for YouTube clips of kittens and puppies doing something cute. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>In the pages that follow, I would like to make a highly subjective and admittedly quixotic list of the qualities that characterize a Poem of Reality, and to discuss some poems that exemplify it. In doing so I hope to offer something more eloquent than bullet points. Stevens has already given me my first point, though. The goal is not to define reality but to glimpse it, to get a sighting, to be like those birders who see, or think they see, what may be a long-extinct Carolina Parrot; or that National Geographic film crew who, after months of stumbling through the Himalayan snow, finally have their footage of a yeti creeping down a rock face, though it may be only a mountain goat; it may be a trick of light.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>Let me move to my second quality, and it is exemplified again and again in the majestic poems of the Polish poet Czeslaw Milosz, who foresaw the Age of Hyperreality with uncanny prescience and terrific dread. By the time of his defection to the West in 1951, having narrowly escaped arrest by the Stalinist authorities he had previously served, Milosz was finished with ideologies in any form. And although he was, and remained, a profoundly spiritual poet, he increasingly found himself drawn to spiritual systems founded upon paradox, doubt, and hermeticism. During his years of exile in the gilded cage of UC Berkeley, he frequently taught a course on that most unabashedly gloomy of religions, Manicheism, which sees the forces of good and of evil perpetually locked in a kind of theological Mexican Standoff. He read deeply in Gnosticism as well, a belief system built upon a kind of cosmic conspiracy theory, in which the material world is thought to be fashioned by deluded gods known as Archons. A believer may find a truth that lies beyond the vast Potemkin Village that is our world, but doing so is never easy. This is a principal message found in the great devotional poem of the Gnostics, “The Hymn to the Pearl,”<i> </i>probably composed in the third century, and a title that Milosz liked so much that he used it for one of his own collections.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Given his immersion in systems such as these, it is not surprising that Milosz’s poems frequently question the nature of reality—and with it language’s inability to evoke the real. This sort of skepticism is repeatedly expressed in interviews conducted with the poet. Here is a typical example: “But what is ever really real? Neither when we experienced it or now, when we put it in words. The poem keeps harkening back to one thing—the inattainability of the real. What we want to get our hands on. The language changes and we change with it. We acquire distance; we are influenced by language&#8230;Language is always an obstacle to perception.” 10 This tone of exasperation also figures in many of Milosz’s poems. They may in places arrive at an affecting lyricism, but this quality is apt to be critiqued as soon as it is expressed. “Gathering Apricots,” from Milosz’s 1991 collection, <i>Provinces,</i> is an elegy to Milosz’s long-suffering wife, Jana. It is achingly tender—and then it is not:<span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span></span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">In the sun, while there, below, over the bay</span><br />
<span class="s1">Only clouds of white mist wander, fleeting,</span><br />
<span class="s1">And the range of hills is grayish on the blue, </span><br />
<span class="s1">Apricots, the whole tree full of them, in the dark leaves,</span><br />
<span class="s1">Glimmer, yellow and red, bringing to mind</span><br />
<span class="s1">The garden of Hesperides and apples of Paradise. </span><br />
<span class="s1">I reach for a fruit and suddenly feel the presence</span><br />
<span class="s1">And put aside the basket and say: “It’s a pity</span><br />
<span class="s1">That you died and cannot see these apricots,</span><br />
<span class="s1">While I celebrate this undeserved life.” </span></p>
<p><span class="s1"> COMMENTARY</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Alas, I did not say what I should have. </span><br />

<span class="s1">Nobody will be able to see her face.</span><br />
<span class="s1">And form itself as always is a betrayal. 11 </span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">       </span>The poem begins with a bucolic description, but even in its opening the details are subtly fraught. Milosz and his co-translator Robert Hass offer the English version of the poem in a stately blank verse—yet the poem’s first line, with its three caesuras, is metrically dissonant, as if to enact the way the sun glints through the fog-bound vista of the bay. (Milosz evokes the landscape of California in many of his poems, but rarely in tourist bureau fashion: in a churlish poem of homage to Robinson Jeffers, he see the Carmel coastline as a place where “Prayers are not heard. Basalt and granite./Above them, a bird of prey. The only beauty.”). 12 When the fruit-laden apricot tree does appear, it comes less as a feature of the speaker’s garden than as a vision from a dream, though not a particularly pleasant one. The apples of the Hesperides, you’ll remember, were guarded by a dragon. As for the apples of paradise, we know what happened when they were consumed. And, as the speaker reaches to pluck an apricot for his basket, the phantom presence of the dead beloved is suddenly acute. The speaker’s subsequent revelation is a heartfelt and straightforward articulation of the poet’s loss: “It’s a pity/ that you died and cannot see these apricots/ while I celebrate this undeserved life.” It expresses the survivor guilt that figures so insistently in Milosz’s later poems, and also pays homage to the elegiac melancholy of classical Chinese and Japanese poetry. Consider Buson’s great haiku: “The piercing chill I feel&#8211;/my dead wife’s comb/in our bedroom, under my feet.” The final lines of the poem’s opening stanza offer a similar abjection and immediacy. But as soon as we arrive at this moment of pained epiphany, Milosz offers his section of “Commentary,” which calls into question everything that the poem’s initial section had asserted. Milosz has of course scrupulously prepared us for this reversal, which turns out not to be such a reversal after all—there’s the metrical shredding of the poem’s opening line, the description of the fog-bound landscape, and even the poet’s choice to use apricots as the vehicle for his revelation: the fruit is symbolically associated with female genitalia, but in medieval Europe it was also associated—and the dauntingly erudite Milosz would have known this—with <i>doubt</i>. Still, to follow the poem’s most emotionally wrenching moment with the deadpan, “Alas, I did not say what I should have” seems almost shocking, and it is not a simple case of Milosz noting the insufficiency of the lyric poem. While the first part of the poem used “fog and chaos” as a vehicle for poetic effect, for a “distillation,” the poet now realizes that these forces represent a cosmic disorder and turmoil that eludes expression, that the voice of the dead beloved is only one among a unnumbered legion of the dead, all of them keening so loudly and insistently that no single voice among them can be discerned. The poem’s true moment of revelation is not the speaker musing as he places his apricot in the basket: that is something that happens<i> in poems. </i>Instead, Milosz offers with a far more inconsolable conclusion: “Nobody will be able to see her face./ And form itself as always is a betrayal.” The final line seems less a critique of our impulse to memorialize the dead through art than it is a “distillation” of the Gnostic belief that material reality is an aberrant construct. Still, brutally pessimistic though the poem’s ending may be, it nevertheless seems oddly bracing. The impulse to elegize, to memorialize&#8211;a quality that has defined what it means to be human at least since the time of the Neanderthal flower burials unearthed in Shanidar Cave—remains undiminished in Milosz’s eyes. Milosz’s poem simply insists on the difficulty—and perhaps the impossibility&#8211;of these endeavors. Its pathos arises from doubt. Here then, is a second feature of the poem of reality: it must accept, to reiterate Milosz’s observation, “the unattainability of the real.” </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>And yet, to accept that condition is not to acquiesce to it. Doubt does not nullify Milosz’s spiritual yearning, nor does it diminish the urgency of the quest for spiritual renewal. A similar quest is undertaken in the poems of the Kaveh Akbar, whose debut volume, <i>Calling a Wolf a Wolf, </i> published in 2017, is a savage and relentless parable of addiction and recovery, a struggle that is most notably evidenced in Akbar’s “Portrait of the Alcoholic&#8230;.” sequence, a series of ten poems, interspersed throughout the collection.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each is a skewed and expressionistic self-portrait, sometimes written in third person, sometimes in first, and bearing titles such as “Portrait of the Alcoholic with Home Invader and Housefly,” and “Portrait of the Alcoholic Frozen in Block of Ice.” The book has garnered considerable attention, and for good reason. Although the collection’s subject matter is harrowing, and Akbar’s treatment of it relentless, he has shorn the poems of the artifice, irony, and benumbing professionalism that so bedevils the work of other young poets. Akbar’s models are unfashionable ones, most notably confessional poets such as Robert Lowell and Anne Sexton, and the poets of the Deep Image, particularly James Wright and W.S. Merwin. The poems’ dramatic situations recall the jagged dark nights of the soul found in poems such as Lowell’s “Skunk Hour,” and Sexton’s “The Double Image.” In their imagery, the poems harken back to the hushed, post-apocalyptic manner of Merwin in collections such as <i>The Lice. </i> As with middle-period Merwin, the voice of Akbar’s poems seems wounded at one moment, prophetic in the next. And it is fitting that the poems are formally dissonant, favoring couplets and quatrains made jarring through the use of surprising applications of white space and startling enjambments. Here, for example, is the opening of a poem entitled “Unburnable the Cold is Flooding Our Lives”:</span></p>

<p class="p10"><span class="s1">To garner a full appreciation of Akbar’s method, with its tonal shifts, astringent sonics and snarling use of metaphor, one needs to examine a poem in its entirety. Here is the volume’s concluding effort, “Portrait of the Alcoholic Stranded Alone on a Desert Island”:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">I live in the gulf</span><br />
<span class="s1">between what I’ve been given</span><br />
<span class="s1">and what I’ve received.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Each morning I dig into the sand</span><br />
<span class="s1">and bury something I love.</span><br />
<span class="s1">Nothing decomposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">It might sound ungrateful to say</span><br />
<span class="s1">I expected poetry, but I did—</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">palm forests and clouds above them</span><br />
<span class="s1">arranged like Dutch still lives,</span><br />
<span class="s1">musically colored fauna lounging</span><br />
<span class="s1">in perpetual near-smiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Instead, these tumors under the surf.</span><br />
<span class="s1">Wildness: to appear</span><br />
<span class="s1">where you are unexpected.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">My favorite drugs are far from here.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Our father, who art in heaven—always</span><br />
<span class="s1">just stepped out, while Earth,</span><br />
<span class="s1">the mother, everywheres around.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">It all just means so intensely: bones</span><br />
<span class="s1">on the beach, calls from the bushes,</span><br />
<span class="s1">the scent of edible flowers</span><br />
<span class="s1">floating in from the horizon.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">I hold my breath.</span><br />
<span class="s1">The boat I am building</span><br />
<span class="s1">will never be done. 14</span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>Akbar’s speaker is a post-modern version of Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe, and his plight is in many ways identical to that of Defoe’s hero, whose tale is less a thrilling yarn of survival and rescue than a dogged&#8211;and undramatic—quest for redemption, deeply informed by Defoe’s Dissenter piety. The novel’s action is repeatedly halted so that Crusoe can offer uplifting spiritual counsel. As he makes a life for himself on his solitary island, Crusoe notes, for example, that “the evil which in itself we seek most to shun, and which, when we are fallen into, is the most dreadful to us, is oftentimes the very means or door of our deliverance&#8230;.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>15 Like Crusoe, Akbar’s speaker is waiting not for a sail to appear on the horizon, but for a spiritual transformation that will sustain him through any form of calamity. The poem speaks the language of surrealism in its “bones /on the beach, calls from the bushes,” but it also alludes to the lingo of 12-Step Programs: “I live in the gulf/between what I have been given/ and what I have received.” The speaker’s island is the scene of his “searching and fearless moral inventory.” Read in this way, the poem’s final trope, “the boat I am building/will never be done,” is simply a highly inventive metaphorical recasting of the Tenth Step: “we </span><span class="s5">continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.”</span><span class="s1"> Akbar’s collection may be seen as his own version of “The Hymn to the Pearl,” as a species of devotional literature. Yet one has to look back to the likes of Donne and Hopkins to find a devotional poetry of such relentless invention and physicality. Akbar’s poem also represents another feature of the Poem of Reality: it may take the form of a quest or initiation, and, as with all quests, the journey is fraught with peril.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>And we must recognize these perils, if only obliquely, from the very moment of our departure. “The Body Mutinies,” the title poem of the late Lucia Perillo’s second collection, published in 1996, is a steely account of one such recognition:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p14"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">              </span><b><i>The Body Mutinies</i></b></span><br />
<span class="s1"><i><span class="Apple-converted-space">               </span>&#8211;Outside St. Pete’s</i></span></p>
<p><span class="s1">When the doctor runs out of words and still</span><br />
<span class="s1">I won’t leave, he latches my shoulder and</span><br />
<span class="s1">steers me out of doors. When I see his blurred hand,</span><br />
<span class="s1">through the milk glass, flapping goodbye like a sail</span><br />
<span class="s1">(&amp; me not griefstruck yet but still amazed: how</span><br />
<span class="s1">words and names—medicine’s blunt instruments—</span><br />
<span class="s1">undid me. And the second, the half seconds,</span><br />
<span class="s1">it took for him to say those words). For now,</span><br />
<span class="s1">I’ll just stand in the courtyard, watching bodies</span><br />
<span class="s1">struggle in then out of one lean shadow</span><br />
<span class="s1">a tall fir lays across the wet flagstones.</span><br />
<span class="s1">Before the sun clears the valence of gray trees</span><br />
<span class="s1">and finds the surgical supply-shop’s window</span><br />
<span class="s1">and makes the dusty bedpans glint like coins.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>16</span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>Perillo, who died at the age of 58 in 2016, managed to at once be her poetic generation’s most unflinching investigator of the subject of illness and mortality (she was long afflicted with crippling multiple sclerosis), and a poet of the most savage and outlandish wit. As a social satirist, whether she was lampooning Viagra commercials, the anthropological scams of Carlos Castaneda, or describing the caretaker of a “Tsunami Museum,” Perillo had no contemporary equal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But Perillo’s levity was always a form of gallows humor; in a haunting essay entitled “A Glimpse,” written near the end of her career, Perillo, bemoans how the experience of living with affliction has sapped and eroded her capacity for black comedy: “&#8230;..my version of my illness has left me—slowly, over the course of twenty years—ever more physically compromised, and I have felt deficient of both willpower and spiritual vigor in being unable to control the slip and swoop and skid. To speak of this does not seem <i>seemly </i>because our tribe likes to hear stories of the body rising.” 17<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“The Body Mutinies” is a premonition of this loss of control, a poem about the first recognition that the trope of the body rising will no longer apply. The account of the speaker’s diagnosis has a smidgen of Perillo’s characteristic waggishness—the doctor “latches” the speaker’s shoulders to lead her from the consultation room, and later gracelessly waves to his patient from his window. He’s the epitome of social cluelessness. In the movie version of the poem, he’d be played by Don Rickles or John Cleese. </span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>The poem’s other descriptions are meted out with painstaking gravity. This effect is achieved in no small part because of the poem’s form. It’s a flawless hybrid sonnet: envelope stanzas in the octet, and a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Petrarchian sextet that employs what is sometimes called “tail rhyme,”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>with the rhyming mate for the last line’s “coins” appearing three lines earlier; the tidiness of a concluding couplet has been eschewed, a gesture that is surely befitting in a poem designed to evoke apprehension and dread. Yet the poem’s formal dexterity is more than matched by the resonance of its imagery: the speaker’s diagnosis is described as a brutalization, “medicine’s blunt instruments.” And as the speaker stands benumbed in the cusp between the realms of the healthy and of the afflicted, she glimpses her future through details set forth with cinematic brio: the fir tree casts an ominous shadow as “bodies struggle in and out” beneath it. But then the chastening sun appears, and with it comes a distinctly shadow-less foreshadowing. It “finds the surgical supply shop window/ and makes the dusty bedpans glint like coins.” We’re reminded of the grimly harsh light of operating rooms and laboratories, and the speaker seems to spy the place where she will one day make her crossing; she even sees the coin that she will offer to Charon. </span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>I fear, dear reader, that my discussion of the Poem of Reality has thus far favored only poems of “harsh reality.” Perillo’s poem is magisterially executed, but it is also wrenching and bereft. The import of Milosz’s and Akbar’s poems is less so—but not much less. Can the sort of poem I hope to define here embrace the “real” but also, however guardedly, approach the sublime? I think it can, though not often, and only via some slantwise and conflicted strategies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>And my example will come to you from what seems an unlikely source—a poem by Robert Penn Warren, whose work as a poet has now been quite nearly forgotten. Although a handful of recent poets have spoken admiringly of his verse, Natasha Tretheway among them, the eclipse of Warren’s poetic reputation has far exceeded the critical re-adjustment that tends to follow in the wake of a writer’s death. This process was already fairly well along 16 years ago, when I reviewed John Burt’s 2001 edition of Warren’s <i>Selected Poems</i> in <i>Poetry—</i>a three-hundred-page distillation of a 1998 <i>Collected</i> nearly three times that length&#8211;and observed that, at times, Warren is an uncontestably great poet. Looking back at the review today, I’m somewhat chagrined by the fact that this claim is buried under pages of caveats about Warren’s limitations and infelicities. Snarky one-liners abound: “Warren serves up the Big Abstractions the way Burger King churns out Whoppers” being the most egregious one, but there are others. If you were a reader curious about Warren’s poetry but unfamiliar with it, the review would likely have destroyed that interest. </span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>It’s not that my assessments were wrong, exactly. But with hindsight, I’ve come to see Warren’s bad writing—from his awkwardness to his ham-fisted grandiosity—as the product of ambition rather than clumsiness or ineptitude.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like Hardy, another novelist who turned exclusively to poetry in his old age, even his best poems are marred by some howlers. But I have become more forgiving of both writers, in no small measure because I am no longer a young poet, nor even a “poet in mid-career.” I am now “a poet of a certain age,” and derive immense solace from the fact that Warren, again like Hardy, wrote his best poems at the end of a very long life. It’s only with his 1968 collection, <i>Incarnations</i>, published when the writer was in his sixties, that Warren can be said to be a of poet of significance, and with that book he became dauntingly productive, issuing seven further collections before his death in 1989. And there is yet another parallel with Hardy: Warren had been practicing to write like a geezer throughout his career. (For example, his first published volume, <i>Thirty-Six Poems</i> (1935), features a galumphing effort entitled “Aged Man Surveys the Past Time,” which contains some jaw-droppingly wretched lines typical of early Warren, among them “Grief’s smarting condiment may satisfy/His heart of lard the wry and blasphemous theme.”) 18 When the time for social security checks finally arrived, Warren had the Old Man Act dead to rights. More importantly, though, during the writing of <i>Incarnations, </i>Warren had somehow turned his defects as a writer into a sort of dogged authenticity. The change is partly due to Warren abandoning the somber Eliotic modernism of his early career in favor of the vernacular and autobiographical verse that so dominated American poetry in the ‘60s and ‘70s. </span><span class="s5">James Wright, a great admirer of Warren, offered one of the most astute appraisals of how Warren’s work had changed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In a 1956 review of Warren’s <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>Promises, </i>a collection<i> </i>that anticipated the essential poetry which he was to write in his old age, Wright observed that Warren had “deliberately shed the armor of competence&#8211;a finely meshed and expensive armor, forged in heaven knows how many bitter intellectual fires&#8211;and [went] out to fight the ungovernable tide.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>19 A halting, stammering music now characterized the poems, one which sought to replicate the immediacy and illogic of the self in moments of crisis, moments when ecstasy can abruptly metamorphose into despair and back again. Wright notes that, although Warren regards himself as a poet of philosophical intention, given to existential brooding on the nature of Truth and Time, his writing is also aggressively visceral: “The really curious and exciting quality [of Warren’s work] is the way the poems can almost drag the reader, by the scruff of the neck, into the experiences which they are trying to shape and understand.”20 </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>How do these qualities relate to my effort to define the Poem of Reality? Some tentative answers to this question can be found in <i>Incarnations</i>’ most resonant lyric, “Masts at Dawn.” Like Philip Larkin’s “Aubade,” the poem commences with an aging speaker fighting insomnia. He’s in the midst of that REM-state-deprived brooding that experts tell us is characteristic of the sleep patterns of the elderly. The speaker has long given up on his efforts to fall back to sleep; now it’s simply a matter of toughing out the last couple hours of darkness. The view from his window is bucolic—a harborscape, likely somewhere in Italy. But the scene Warren evokes is weirdly askew:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s3">Past second cock-crow yacht masts in the harbor go slowly white.</span></p>
<p><span class="s3">No light in the east yet, though the stars show a certain fatigue.</span><br />
<span class="s1">They withdraw into a new distance, have discovered our unworthiness. It is long since</span><br />
<span class="s1">The owl, in the dark eucalyptus, dire and melodious, last called, and</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Long since the moon sank and the English</span><br />
<span class="s1">Finished fornicating in their ketches. In the evening there was a strong swell.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Red died the sun, but at dark wind rose easterly, white sea nagged the black harbor headland.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">When there is a strong swell, you may, if you surrender to it, experience</span><br />
<span class="s1">A sense, in the act, of mystic unity with that rhythm. Your peace is the sea’s will.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>21</span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1">No armor of competence here: the owl in the “dark eucalyptus” may have been hooting melodiously, but not our speaker. There are poetic effects a-plenty, but all of them are jarring: the jackhammer spondees of the opening line; the personified stars; the disjointed syntax with its oddball parentheticals and archaic-sounding inversions (“Red died the sun.”); the personified stars; the so-bad-it’s-good characterization of the English having finished “fornicating in their ketches”&#8211;and the personified stars. And then there are the baffling prosodic effects: the decision to alternate couplets and single-lined stanzas seems wholly arbitrary, as are many of the enjambments, particularly that “and” dangling out in the middle of nowhere. And of course the lines are too long to offer any metrical effect. In his notes to the poem in Warren’s <i>Collected</i>, editor John Burt remarks that Warren’s lines seem intended as “a feature of book design rather than of versification.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>22 In other words, Warren simply liked the way his behemoth lines looked on the page. Burt also lets us know that “Masts at Dawn” looked even weirder in an earlier version that appeared in a quarterly—instead of giving us stanza breaks, Warren followed each line with a trio of asterisks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yet for all of this, the effect of the poem’s opening is mesmerizing, for Wright is absolutely correct: we are being pulled by the scruff of the neck into the consciousness of a speaker querulously trying to make sense of events that should be rhapsodic, but decidedly are not. The poem begins in almost utter stillness: the actions described are so kinetic as to be frenzied, but they have all taken place earlier. The owl has called it a night, the English have fallen into a post-coital slumber; those personified stars are weary of twinkling. But the masts in the harbor “go slowly white,” an odd description, given that in the poem’s next line we are told there is of yet no light to illumine them. The speaker asks that the reader surrender to the rhythms of the tides, yet this injunction is oddly unsettling, recalling the “oceanic feeling” that Freud tells us can accompany the death wish. “Mystic unity” with the sea’s rhythm seems an invitation to oblivion. And, as the poem continues, the poem’s sense of existential alarm grows ever more adamant:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">But now no motion. The bay-face is glossy in darkness, like</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">An old window pane, flat on black ground by the wall, near the ash heap. It neither</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Receives nor gives light. Now is the hour when the sea</span><br />
<span class="s1">Sinks into meditation. It doubts its own mission. The drowned cat</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">That on the evening swell had kept nudging the piles of the pier and had seemed</span><br />
<span class="s1">To want to climb out and lick itself dry, now floats free. On the surface, a slight convexity only, it is like</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">An eyelid in darkness, closed. </span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1">The rhythms of the poem are now insistent; even the caesuras and enjambments can’t impede the sense that the speaker is fiercely grappling with the meaning of what he sees. The personification Warren so favors remains—the sea “doubts its own mission”—but it is the metaphors and stark descriptions that now move the poem forward, and they are brilliant: the sea likened to a windowpane laid flat on the ground, and later like “an eyelid in darkness, closed.” And then there’s the drowned cat, at first bumping against the pier but now floating free; the image is so striking and kinetic that the poem seems to suddenly reconfigure itself around it. The cat is the <i>punctum</i>, the center around which every other detail in the poem revolves, and when Warren follows this description by likening the sea surface to “an eyelid in darkness, closed,” it’s almost impossible for us not to conflate this metaphor with our mental image of the cat. We are no longer seeing the water’s surface, we are instead left with a vision of <i>that cat</i>, affixed in the pupil of an eye, affixed there even if that eye—as the speaker will later tell us&#8211;is closed in a darkened room.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Warren has now set us up for the poem’s finale:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">                                       You must learn to accept the kiss of fate, for</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">The masts go white slow, as light, like dew, from darkness</span><br />
<span class="s1">Condenses on them, on oiled wood, on metal. Dew whitens in darkness.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">I lie in my bed and think how, in darkness, the masts go white.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">The sound of the engine of the first fishing dory dies seaward. Soon</span><br />
<span class="s1">In the inland glen wakes the dawn-dove. We must try</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">To love so well the world that we may believe, in the end, in God.</span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1">This scene is so powerfully evocative that we do not at first see how utterly strange it is. The dew on the harbored boats condenses and glows; the masts seem to whiten not from the dawn’s light, but from some ghostly inner force. And of course the speaker does not witness this scene; he’s in bed imagining it. The dove-cry and the sputter of the fishing dory are real, but the scene of dawn breaking upon the harbor is all speculation—reliable speculation, but not unassailable. Once we are made aware of this, the poem’s ending, which might at first seem to us a non sequitur or rhetorical trick, speaks to us with authentic grandeur. And not as grandiosity: it is an exigent but ambivalent plea, a stuttering agnostic prayer, its wisdom—and I have no hesitation about using that word—derives from Warren’s bewildered astonishment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let me add that “Masts at Dawn” represents yet another characteristic of the Poem of Reality: it must stammer and self-correct itself toward sublimity. The poem’s method must reflect the rough and circuitous workings of the poet’s mind; elegance would be inauthentic. For half a century, we have used such language to describe the archly nonlinear poetry of John Ashbery. But Warren here maps consciousness with just as much acuity—and with a far greater urgency.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1"> *</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>As I write this, a simulacrum sprawls behind its desk in the Oval Office. Every word it utters is a lie, including “and” and “the.” Other fake humans gather round it, passing it a pen to use as it prepares to sign another Executive Order. It dwells in a pseudo-world, where the pseudo-country that it claims to run has been made Great Again. Philip K. Dick foresaw the arrival of this creation, and predicted how it has imperiled us all; its fakery does not diminish the immensity of its danger. And that prediction, or prophecy, is indeed an activity of the most august imagination.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is there any place for poetry in this new reality? Or should I label it this new unreality? I think there may be. What makes Warren’s poem heroic&#8211;if I may use another durable but unfashionable word—is its capacity to unrelentingly struggle against what Milosz calls “the unattainability of the real.” As Milosz well knew, in that struggle the poet will invariably lose. But, as I hope I have shown here, poets have some strategies at their disposal that will allow them to approach if not attain the real. And to engage in such an effort during a time when fakery and the public lie so prevail, is an act of moral as well as aesthetic imperative.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It may not save us, but at least we will go down fighting.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“It is pleasant to read about whales through their own spectacles,” Ishmael says, and I will have to take his word for it, not having a strip of sperm whale cuticle to test out the matter for myself. He is referring to the “infinitely thin” and transparent layer that encases the whale from fluke to forehead and that, once peeled and dried and broken into shards, functions for him as a bookmark, and even “exerts a magnifying influence” upon the words of the whale books that he reads. I have my doubts about the magnifying power of desiccated whale dermis.</p>
<p>I have read this passage over and over. It appears in Chapter 68 of <em>Moby-Dick</em>, “The Blanket,” and when I read it, I am looking not through whale skin but through Ishmael himself. He is my lens, and he has just blithely admitted to his distorting power. He, for the breadth of this chapter, is reading not his whale books, but the whale itself, specifically the marks that crisscross the captured whale, the lines scored upon its body by its encounters in the sea with rocks and corals, other animals, other whales, other harpooners.</p>
<p>Ishmael’s imagination is excited by these marks, these “hieroglyphics” and “mysterious cyphers,” and by this point in the story we have come to expect what his mind will do with them. The “mystic-marked whale remains indecipherable” but nonetheless charged with energy. The markings testify to contact, to an embodied history, even if they remain that which Ahab chiefly hates, an “inscrutable thing.” Ishmael, on the other hand, is roused by the mystery, driven to ecstatic flights of fancy.</p>
<p>Each time I read this chapter, I expect to find the word “palimpsest,” but with its European origin in domesticated animals and medieval manuscripts, that word is, rather significantly, one of the things that does <em>not</em> come to Ishmael’s mind. Instead, he likens the marks to Indian characters chiseled on the banks of the Upper Mississippi, and rocks on the New England coast that have been grazed by icebergs. His sperm whale is, somehow, American and ancient all at once.</p>
<p>I wish I could tap Ishmael on the shoulder as he bends over his magnifying skin and tell him what I learned just the other day, that there are bowhead whales currently swimming off Alaska’s Arctic waters who were alive when he was. We know this, because the Eskimo who are still allowed to hunt for subsistence have caught whales with nineteenth-century harpoon points lodged in their flesh. It is not hard to hear Ishmael’s reveries on this matter.</p>
<p>Can anyone question that the sperm whale is Ishamel’s? If the whale ship is his Yale College and his Harvard, his textbook is the whale itself. It is my firm contention here that Ishmael, before and after he is a merchant sailor and a whaler and the writer of the voyage of the <em>Pequod</em>, is a reader. Magnified or distorted, whatever I read in <em>Moby-Dick</em> I read doubled through Ishmael, who is constituted wholly by the cognitive act of reading the whale. This, for me, is what accounts for the spectral nature of his presence in the novel. He is not actually there, just like I am not actually in my chair when I read <em>Moby-Dick</em>. He is the projection of a reading mind within the pages of an adventure tale. Intensely alive and yet absent in so many ways.</p>
<p>We have already spoken of what effect the inscrutability of the whale’s markings has on Ishmael. We must needs speak at much greater length about the fact that, even before you can read the whale, the very skin of the whale forms for Ishmael a “not unvexed subject.” Not unvexed at all. One might go so far as to say “vexed.” Because as it turns out, “experienced whalemen afloat, and learned naturalists ashore” cannot even say for certain what whale skin<em> is</em>.</p>
<p>We are in strange territory in “The Blanket.” We must dive down below the glassine layer on the surface of whale, which cannot possibly count as its skin, being “thinner and more tender than the skin of a new-born child.” It is Ishmael’s contention that the true skin is the blubber, the yellowish-white fat between ten and twenty inches in thickness. On what basis does Ishmael make his case? Well, in part because the markings that he reads so keenly are seen through the thin outer layer. The writing is within.</p>
<p>But here my doubts surface again. Are there <em>really</em> controversies among naturalists as to what constitutes something so basic and palpable as a whale’s skin? What are the poles of the controversy and whose opinion does Ishmael counter?</p>
<p>Melville’s favorite cetological source during the ardent eighteen months in which he composed<em> Moby-Dick</em> was Thomas Beale’s <em>The Natural History of the Sperm Whale</em> from 1839.</p>
<p>We know it was his favorite, because he underlined and check-marked and annotated it more exhaustively than any other book in his library. And we know about all those xxs and circles in the margins because they have recently been painstakingly revived by a dedicated corps of scholars after a century of erasure. Melville’s copy of Beale’s book was sold from his estate after his death, and it passed through a number of hands, at least one of which was a librarian, who surely must have been the one to obliterate his pencil marks. The book was stickered for a library collection and then sometime later sold again, at which point its stickers were stripped. Finally in the 1930s someone bothered to read Melville’s inked signature on the half-title page, and it only took thirty more years for the book to end up at Harvard’s Houghton Library. In this decade, under the penetrating gaze of cameras and Photoshop, the traces of Melville’s hand have once again surfaced. To put a very fine point on it, we know what Melville knew because a team of sub-sub librarians have read the palimpsests, deciphered the hieroglyphs, accurately detected the true skin of the book that was once under Melville’s scrutiny.</p>
<p>And there it is in Chapter One: a checkmark in the margin right next to Beale’s statement that the sperm whale’s skin is “frequently marked on the sides by linear impression, appearing as if rubbed against some angular body.” Turn the page and Melville has flicked another mark next to the staunch declaration that the blubber is the <em>cutis vera</em> of the whale.</p>
<p>But if we are curious enough to flip to Chapter Eight of Beale’s work, we find that he takes up the matter at greater length, as indeed he must, for there are not two layers to the sperm whale as Ishmael might have you believe, but three: the cuticle or rete mucosum, the cutis, and the blubber. The middle stratum is villous, pliable, and ridged. Beale suddenly introduces italics to his prose, and all indications are that he is heading into treacherous waters, for this middle layer “seems to the <em>termination of the cellular membrane of the body more closely united</em>, having smaller interstices, and becoming more compact.” If I am not mistaken, he is suggesting with no little urgency that the cutis is where we find the gossamer outer sheath giving way to interiority. And yes, there it is: “the whole has more the appearance of <em>one uniform substance</em>.” But on the very next page Beale has returned to his earlier tenet on blubber. Again, Melville placed a mark.</p>
<p>Could Beale be equivocating where Ishmael does not? He does not explicitly refer to dissension on the matter, but he does attribute his opinion to Professor Jacob of Dublin, in what now reads to my eye like a dodge. To Professor Arthur Jacob, then, a doctor of Anatomy and Physiology in the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.</p>
<p>When a bottlenose whale was stranded on the beaches of Killiney a few miles from Dublin, he seized upon the animal for dissection, and later he measured a six-weeks-dead whale that had been found floating some distance from Innisturk. His papers in the <em>Dublin Philosophical Journal</em> are, I see, well-known among learned naturalists, and his opinion, though backed only by Professors Hamilton, Pallas, and Giescecki, is distinctive enough that all feel compelled to mention it. Jacob strenuously argues that the blubber is the “true <em>reticulated</em> <em>skin</em>” of the whale, and he uses one of the very same criteria by which Ishmael also nominates the blubber: the impossibility of raising any other integral layer from the body.</p>
<p>So Ishmael was right—the controversy does rage, and he, Jacob, and Beale are the renegades. I find that my feelings are mixed and that part of me wanted to discover that the dispute was Ishmael’s literary device, that we are reading not a whale but a book that swims in the ocean. The other part me of dearly wants to know more about this whale.</p>
<p>The consensus view can be found in Melville’s other foundational source for the cetological chapters of <em>Moby-Dick</em>, William Scoresby, Jr.’s <em>An Account of the Arctic Regions with a History and Description of the Northern Whale Fishery </em>of 1820. What does Mr. Scoresby—explorer, scientist, son of a whaleboat captain, tamer of polar bears, inspiration for the character of Lee Scoresby in Philip Pullman’s <em>His Dark Materials</em>—say on the matter, on behalf of Professors Ray, Tyson, Pennant, Hunter, and Cuvier, among others?</p>
<p>Scoresby’s stance is striking for the lack of anxiety which surrounds it. Furthermore, Charles Darwin, whose copy of Scoresby’s book I am reading, found nothing within these pages worth underlining or commenting on. Quite simply, the true skin of the whale is neither cuticle nor blubber. It is a layer between the two, “which is white and tough” and a great delicacy to the Eskimo, who crowd around whaleships just returned from the hunt to snag pieces and feed them to their babies. The strips with bits of blubber still attached are especially prized, and I sense Scoresby mentions this not so that you will know how properly to eat whale skin the next time it is offered, but to rebut the view that nothing but cuticle and blubber can be peeled from the whale.</p>
<p>Scoresby also just casually tosses off mention of a fourth layer to this seemingly infinite matter. Above the true skin but below the cuticle lies the rete mucosum, generally about three-fourths of an inch thick in the adult sperm whale.</p>
<p>It is enough to make the non-cetologist despair. Beale too mentioned the <em>rete mucosum</em>. Can this really be so difficult? I feel submerged within the layers. Can we not ride on an Eskimo whaleship and watch as the blanket is peeled to enumerate the strata? But no, my only recourse is a pencil, and I flip through my notes on Scoresby and Beale and draw whale skin cross-sections in the margins to ascertain that Beale’s <em>rete mucosum</em> is different than Scoresby’s. The two cannot be reconciled.</p>
<p>The <em>rete mucosum</em>, for Scoresby, deserves nothing more than a brief mention, though it is a layer unto itself. Beale, on the other hand, equates it with the cuticle, which we set aside at the very outset. It is Beale who encourages me to pick it back up, with this staggering assertion: “It is the cuticle which gives the colour to the animal; and in parts that are dark, I think I have seen a dirty coloured substance washed away in the separation of the cuticle from the cutis.”</p>
<p>I squint in vain for a checkmark in the margin next to Beale’s revelation. How is it possible that Melville abstained from marking this passage? I truly cannot believe it. How does the rete mucosum not arrest Ishmael’s fantasies of spelunking into the whale’s skin? How does it not disorder his entire story of the whale with no color? The rete mucosum suddenly seems like Ishmael’s blind spot, that which should have troubled his mind to the point of fervent philosophizing. That which gives the whale its color, that which can leak its color into the sea upon a certain provocation, that which whales share with humans, at least according to the nineteenth-century medical journals that I am now consulting, having set aside the natural history books in my state of pure shock.</p>
<p>John Bell in his <em>Anatomy and Physiology of the Human Body</em> of 1834 contains some eerily familiar passages. Bell confidently identifies the true skin of the human, which is the cutis, above which sits three laminae: the cuticle, the rete mucosum and the vascular membrane. The rete mucosum is “the seat of colour in the skin,” and in brown-skinned people it is darker on the bottom than the top of this stratum, proof that its pigment is independent of the sun.</p>
<p>Was this the consensus view? I find a copy of Bransby Blake Cooper’s <em>Lectures on Anatomy</em> of 1830 which, a watermark on each page tells me, has been digitized by Google. I am startled to see a hand in the margins holding down some of the pages, a hand belonging to a black woman, a sub-sub-librarian with pink nail polish and two silver rings. Yes, the cutis is the true skin, Cooper says almost impatiently, but the human dermis has only three layers in total: a cuticle, cutis, and a rete mucosum attached firmly to the surface of the cutis. In dark-skinned people but not light-skinned ones, this structure is so thick in portions “as very much to resemble the rete mucosum of the cetacei.”</p>
<p>I do not have words for the sensation that comes over me as I read these words. How do you describe the palpability of absence, the near certainty that someone has retracted himself into invisibility right in front of you? I have as few words to describe this sensation as I do the act of reading itself. Ishmael, the one whose face I can never see because I peer from behind it, is outlined by the antique words of Professors Beale, Jacob, Scoresby, Bell, and Cooper. He is right there, in what he knows and what I have just felt rise into my mind.</p>
<p>“The Blanket” ends with an exhortation. No matter the true skin of the whale; the entire “fathom-deep enfoldings” contain a clear moral: “herein we see the rare virtue of a strong individual vitality, and the rare virtue of thick walls, and the rare virtue of interior spaciousness. Oh, man! admire and model thyself after the whale!” And I have always thought that <em>Moby-Dick</em> is the record of a man doing just that, by turning himself into a book, for what else has those inner dimensions?</p>
<p>Yet what a curious conclusion to draw about a chapter which is, after all, about skin. About surface and envelope, membrane and casing. The visible. The colored.</p>
<p>Ishmael’s quest to become the whale takes him through its very belly, a Jonah on the beach. After noting that he has “chiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect,” Ishmael admits that it is now time to “unbutton him still further” and present the whale “in his ultimatum.” He recalls the time when he attained the “rare knowledge” of the Sperm Whale’s insides by clambering through a skeleton, preserved intact on the island of Tranque in the Arsacides. With a ball of twine and a bough for a measuring-rod, he “wandered, eddied long amid his many winding, shaded colonnades and arbors.” Finally he resurfaced on the beach with his measurements—which he then proceeded to tattoo on his right arm. He tells us, “I was crowded for space, and wished the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem I was then composing.” Depth has once again been inscribed on the casing.</p>
<p>Ishmael goes into the whale and emerges with an abrasion from the contact. If he is like the whale, he is even more like the one in <em>Moby-Dick</em> who is already modeled after the whale.</p>
<p>I am speaking of Queequeg, the dark-skinned human with a rete mucosum as thick as the cetacei, the tattooed human whose markings Ishmael cannot decipher, though he knows that they are nothing less than “a complete theory of the heavens and the earth, and a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth; so that Queequeg in his own proper person was a riddle to unfold; a wondrous work in one volume.”</p>
<p>Though Queequeg cannot read—not even his own body, as Ishmael learns to his surprise—he can interpret the signs that say he will die, and so he builds a coffin which he then carves with “all manner of grotesque figures and drawings” as if “to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on his body.” This manuscript so painstakingly copied from the scribe himself becomes, of course, Ishmael’s life preserver.</p>
<p>Ishmael is saved by the unread book of Queequeg, buoyed by its hollowness, its interior spaciousness, but we must note, we must never let out of our sight that Ishmael says of the harpooner, “For whatever is truly wondrous and fearful in man, never yet was put into words or books.” And he does not try. He does not try, and he does not even call our attention to his deliberate refusal to read the book of Queequeg. Unless of course it is Queequeg who is the subject of the poem on Ishmael’s body, the blank page—the blind spot, kept opaque even to himself.</p>
<p>Ishmael blooms inside my head, finally, by what he chooses not to say, by the unfathomable expanse of everything between his words that he has somehow made immanent to me. Truly, I only wanted to know if the vexed subject of the whale’s true skin was a literary device or not, but only begin to think like Ishmael, and you find yourself writing, like him, “a little treatise on Eternity.” If I’ve got it right, it goes something like this: we should be like the whale, which is to say, like a book, which is to say, like Ishmael, which is to say, like Queequeg.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>                                    Hidden Sex</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>It’s arguable in some cases, indisputable in others, that writing about unrequited love yields penetrating work. It’s the particular agonizing discomfort of the emotion that gives an artist both the single-minded focus to write at his rawest, and also all the unbroken time in which to do it. Generally speaking, when one is happy, in love, going about the flower-picking, melody-humming business of daily life, he doesn’t need his work as much. He can write about the changing seasons, he can meditate upon the state of the world, sift through the travails of childhood to uncover the very moment in time when he became disillusioned. But once someone is broken over love, it can become an obsession, at which point there is no better work desk, no better quill, no better conductor for art than unrequited love.</p>
<p>But also it can be cloying, melancholic, self-pitying. The language can be purple, sometimes unoriginal. All that single-mindedness, all that inward festering, can show up on the page like a wound, and not a healed one that glimmers like mica, but a wet, new one, unsavory and explicit.</p>
<p>What if the artist cannot be honest? What if the artist must mask her obsession, and what if, further, it’s not just one person who is not returning her feelings, but an entire gender, an entire world of desire?</p>
<p>Where most artists who pine-write are hermetic in their pining, that is not so in the case of Charlotte Mew.</p>
<p>Mew was born in Bloomsbury, into a family that aspired to a higher social class, but was riddled with setbacks. Her brother and sister were diagnosed with schizophrenia and confined to institutions. Three other siblings died in early childhood. Her architect father died without leaving any money to provide for the remaining family. So Mew, her other sister, Anne, and their mother took in lodgers, and Mew turned to the vocation preferred by women of her aspirant class who needed to earn a living: she began to write.</p>
<p>Her mother, priggish and snooty, wanted her to act the lady. By contrast, Mew wanted to wear mannish clothes and roll her own cigarettes. She and her remaining uninstitutionalized sister vowed never to marry, so that they might never pass on their mental illness genes to another generation. Mew traveled to France and spent time on the docks with the boat boys. She became fascinated by the underbelly of society, feeling a kinship with its marginalized citizens.</p>
<p>For a decade, Mew published short stories in journals like <em>The Yellow Book</em>, but it wasn’t until the publication of “The Farmer’s Bride,” in <em>The Nation</em> in 1912, that Mew found her place.</p>
<p>Soon after, she had become respected by the best minds of her time; Thomas Hardy said “she was by far and away the best living woman poet,” a statement echoed in some form by Virginia Woolf, Ezra Pound, among others.</p>
<p>There were two significant loves in Mew’s life: Ella D’Arcy and May Sinclair. Both spurned her, in different ways. Mew met D’Arcy when she was contributing to <em>The Yellow Book, </em>where D’Arcy was an assistant editor, and they become great friends, but D’Arcy was a confirmed heterosexual and rebuffed Mew—it seems from poems Mew wrote during the time—during a ghastly night in a hotel room in Paris. The unrequited love for Sinclair ended more cruelly. Though at first Sinclair pursued Mew, sending her notes and requesting a meeting, in the end Sinclair told their mutual friends of Mew’s fanatical feelings, recounting a scene where she once had to jump over a bed to get away from Mew.</p>
<p>Sadly for her, happily, perhaps, for her readers, Mew had to open her longing up in certain ways. Her narrators could not be her, thinly veiled. They could not even be her gender. Either they were men, as in “The Farmer’s Bride,” or they were genderless. Most of her poems’ subjects address a loved one who has gone away or died.  Meanwhile the speaker is this neutral beast; even her male speakers have an almost universal, mythic quality. Of course this likely emanated from a strained mind, and there must have been many difficulties in the shrouding, but what remains on the page is a remarkable ease, so that Mew’s essentially-masked poetry is more freeing and produces a more interesting effect than, say, a man writing about a woman he loves.</p>
<p>“The Farmer’s Bride” was, in fact, the poem which drew May Sinclair’s admiration, leading the novelist to court Mew’s friendship with a note of adulation. At the time of the poem’s publication, a wife could not legally refuse her husband’s sexual advances. But at Mew’s writing, attitudes to marriage were rapidly changing.</p>
<p>Of course, one could read the poem very simply, for the way it addresses the clash between society and individual, for its caretaking sentiment of the bride, as though the poet were merely making a statement on the patriarchal abusiveness of the law.</p>
<p>But if you read it more closely, a very obsessive heart hums at the base of every line. The narrator is the farmer himself, speaking in his dialect—<em>when us was wed, runned away</em>, etc, likely an Isle of Wight tongue, where Mew spent her childhood summers; she was forbidden by her mother to speak in that dialect at home in London—about the wife he chose, who was too young, perhaps, and more interested in the animals in the barn than in consummating her marriage to him.</p>
<p>Of course, the farmer would feel frustrated at this. After all, he is legally owed a conjugal relationship with his wife, and there she is, fluttering about with the birds and rabbits, but growing fearful and slipping away whenever any men come near.</p>
<p>One way to read the poem is to assume that Mew is the bride herself. As a woman who likes women, it would make sense that she feels this great anxiety over what society expects from her. The men coming to hunt her and force her into the strictures of that society would have filled her with great trepidation.</p>
<p>But there is yet another way to read it.</p>
<p><em>Sweet as the first wild violets, she,<br />
</em><em>To her wild self. But what to me?</em></p>
<p><em> </em>In these lines, one can hear another tone. Yes, the farmer is still speaking, he is still frustrated. But suddenly, there is a sharpness, a depth that transcends the farmer’s local speech and rises to something greater. Here, it seems the poet herself is speaking. The speaker is no longer the bride that wants to escape the pursuant menfolk on the farm, but a person who is in great emotional pain, who craves something that will not love her back—that, in fact, runs from her.</p>
<p>The farmer returns, with his casual frustration, for another stanza and a half. And then we arrive at the final three lines, a marvel of imagery, sound, and plangent obsession:</p>
<p><em>            Betwixt us. Oh! my God! the down,<br />
</em><em>The soft young down of her, the brown,<br />
</em><em>The brown of her – her eyes, her hair, her hair!</em></p>
<p><em> </em>These lines, the utter mania of them, seem to reach up through the page, grabbing the reader by the throat and saying, Don’t you see! How I suffer!</p>
<p>The repetition, indeed, throughout this piece and others, is something Mew uses to heighten the hysteria. But it isn’t a violent and mannish hysteria; it’s closer to a fierce but muted cry.</p>
<p>Suddenly it seems the poet is not the bride at all, but a fellow worshipper of the bride, someone who is not a man, someone who does not want to enter her and force his will, but who wants to admire and love her. Of course, all types of obsessive love are difficult for the subject to endure, regardless of gender. And the speaker of the poem seems blind to that, much the way May Sinclair alleges that Mew was blind to her disinterest. But beyond these narrative elements, the voice of the poem, because it is mired in this confusion, because perhaps the poet herself was at various times in her mind the bride, or the farmer, and sometimes neither, but a watcher who saw it all and was rendered despondent by the state of affairs, is wonderfully unbiased. Like water it flows. Like oil and vinegar it separates and accuses itself and argues. For of all these reasons, the poem sings beyond itself. It manages to pine from multiple directions, and to counter the pining at the same time.</p>
<p>In “Fame,” there is a different metier. The poem is full of lovely, shocking, claustrophobic images (<em>the over-heated house, the moon’s dropped child)</em>. The speaker derides the people who are on her stairs, who do not love her beyond her art. She wants to leave Fame, even as she has just now found its apex (<em>Fame, still with such eyes and that bright hair!)</em> but she can’t leave it, because Fame is her ticket to the world of women like May Sinclair. Without Fame, Mew would just be a woman who loves women, without the possibility that one of these women might love her work first, and later, her.</p>
<p>Often this sort of manic yet conciliatory understanding of the way the world works can be gleaned just from the aforementioned repetition in Mew’s work.  In “The Narrow Door,” the words, <em>The narrow door, the narrow door</em> begin the poem and then appear twice more throughout.</p>
<p>In “The Peddler,” we have, <em>The road, the road, beyond men’s bolted doors. </em>In that poem, the speaker asks the subject for the key that locks her heavy heart. This speaker is reminiscent of the speaker in “The Farmer’s Bride.”  There is a broken-up pining.</p>
<p>Then there is this stanza:</p>
<p><em>While my gay ghost caught and kissed yours, as ghosts don’t do,<br />
</em><em>And by the wayside, this forgotten you and I<br />
</em><em>Sat, and were twenty-two</em></p>
<p>The notion of a gay ghost, of course, strikes one if they know Mew’s sexual preference. This poem could be about D’Arcy, as the timeline would suggest.</p>
<p>But the word <em>ghost</em> is far more telling than the word <em>gay</em>.  It speaks to the filmy part of Mew’s self that does not see the light or, perhaps, the side of her that has been killed.</p>
<p>Still, there is something about the word <em>gay</em> that catches, that echoes, that even bristles. Like schoolchildren one might have the urge to rifle through Mew’s poems to find the word. If one were looking to brand Mew, using this word, her own word, against her, then one might feel successful. In “Jour de Morts,” there is the line, <em>But white and wistful ghosts of gayer roses</em>, quite a lovely line and again there is, too, the word, <em>ghost</em>.</p>
<p>In this poem one finds many similarities in tone to “The Farmer’s Bride,” and it also echoes Yeats’ “When You are Old.”</p>
<p><em>Ah! no! come out with me before the grey gate closes<br />
</em><em>            It is your fête and here is your bouquet.         </em></p>
<p><em> </em>The speaker seems, again, to be a genderless watcher, in love with a woman as she fades into the sunset of her life.</p>
<p>Returning to the word, <em>gay</em>:<br />
In “Afternoon Tea,” we have<em> Gay Kate’s stolen kisses…</em></p>
<p>In “Song,” we have, <em>my gayest game.</em></p>
<p>In “A Farewell,” we have, <em>And should she not be gay, Poor lady! Well she too must have her day. </em></p>
<p>Therein lies the trouble with society, and likely the one that Mew was trying to avoid by keeping her narrators neutral. One is somewhat trained to read each poem looking for a phallus, or the anti-phallus, the smooth marble, untouched. And indeed what is it about society – that we still do this – how long will the homophobic hangover last, that we still need to comb through a text for the word <em>gay</em> as though we were investigators?</p>
<p>It can be argued that only because homosexuality did then and still does carry so much baggage—even beyond homophobia, there is still a clandestine cast to same-sex relationships—  must we pay attention to the ways in which it might have strangled an artist. In Mew’s case, the argument is that the strangulation produced a striking effect. One has to consider that this argument is cloistering in itself, that it is unfair and, perhaps, a backtracking, a negation of progression.</p>
<p>Sometimes, Mew’s speakers are very male, boundlessly so, almost exuberantly so. In “The Fête,” the narrator is a young man, but more specifically he is all young boys. One can feel the exaggeration, almost, in the phrase, <em>us boys</em>, and perhaps see Mew dressed up like Viola as Cesario—indeed Mew did dress in men’s attire, so this is not a terrific stretch, however this poem feels steeped in such images.</p>
<p>In the last stanza of “The Fête,”</p>
<p><em>All my life long I shall see moonlight on the fern<br />
</em><em>                      And the black trunks of trees. Only the hair<br />
</em><em>            Of any woman can belong to God.<br />
</em><em>The stalks are crudely broken where we trod,<br />
</em><em>                                    There had been violets there,<br />
</em><em>                                    I shall not care<br />
</em><em>            As I used to when I see the bracken burn.</em></p>
<p>The poem is about a boy whose life was forever altered by one night with a circus performer. But what is most striking is the line about the hair of women, which for Mew is clearly the symbol of her desire, it’s the thing that drives her mad with longing. And more important still is the voice of the narrator, this young man, all young men— Mew has sharpened their ability to convey their lust and desire for women in words, but at the same time she has softened it, so that the desire exists on a more altruistic plane. The desire is for the woman to endure as an exalted being, and not in the way some men worship women, but in the way that the flowers and the birds might revere a forest sprite.</p>
<p>By writing from the point of view of a man, Mew of course inures herself to being called a lesbian. She also inures herself to denunciations of her opinions. She can scorn society as a man, as easily as she can pine for a woman, like a man. In this way, when one arrives to an actual genderless poem, one may appreciate it even more, for being even quieter than usual.</p>
<p>In “Left Behind,” the final stanza:</p>
<p><em>And one fine morning in a sunny lane<br />
</em><em>            Some boy and girl will meet and kiss and swear<br />
</em><em>                        That nobody can love their way again<br />
</em><em>                                    While over there<br />
</em><em>            You will have smiled, I shall have tossed your hair.</em></p>
<p>The beauty here is in the indentation. The first two lines describe a typical scene—two young lovers betting their love is the first and only that has existed with such profundity of feeling and scope. <em>While over there</em>, in the discreet middle of the line, seems to hide itself, seems to almost wink at its subject, as though to say, You and I once were there, where no one saw us.</p>
<p>When Mew speaks of men who’ve died, as in “Arracombe Wood,” she does not weep for men as a man might, or as a woman might, but in this gender-fluid way, that is perhaps the most unadorned, unencumbered. It renders the obsession not mild but infinitely palatable. Like something one will never tire of eating.</p>
<p>This follows in “My Heart is Lame,” which begins, <em>My heart is lame with running after yours so fast. </em>Mew is weary, and her poetry has that air of weariness. Not a fierce passion, but a weary one. It succeeds inconspicuously, as do all things of passion written with enough distance to be gorgeous and not merely bloody.</p>
<p>That weariness would follow her all her days, because she could not find love that would stay. After Sinclair, Mew had several other friendship-romances, and whether or not they were physically consummated is unknown.  Of course one can’t overlook the patriarchy of the time, as in Yeats’ branding of Mew as the finest living <em>woman</em> poet. But for Mew her fears were not driven by career. Unlike others, her career was incidental, it was a way in which she might first make money, and later find love, by being exposed to other intelligent women like herself, progressive enough to give into any homosexual predilections.</p>
<p>But how fine the art is, how open it becomes when she made it larger to hide herself, and to accommodate herself. Her words aren’t full of growth simply because the narrator might be anyone. There is a greater alchemy involved. Her poems are so breathtaking because there is an inversion that happens. The narrowing impulse leads to a “widening gyre,” a funnel of poetry.</p>
<p>Mew’s last days ended as her life began, in fear and loneliness. After Mew’s sister, Anne, died of liver cancer, Mew began to suffer delusions. She would see visions, for example, of her sister’s body dappled with dark specks.  All her life she’d feared ending up like her schizophrenic siblings, and now here the nightmare was actually happening. She placed herself into a nursing home and eventually committed suicide in 1928, by swallowing a bottle of Lysol. That there was no one there to tell her the dark specks she saw were not delusions, but that her sympathetic, perspicacious mind might be seeing the cancer personified, the way her poetry personified a loneliness that was greater than the sum of the genders—that there was no one there to tell her is one of those misfortunes of life.  Some have none, and some have more than they need, to write as stunningly as they might.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="c4"><strong><span class="c11">A: INTERESTING OTTER FACTS</span></strong></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c1">A few years ago, while on a wildlife sightseeing cruise in Alaska, our boat encountered a group of North Pacific Sea Otters swimming placidly off the port bow. As the passengers scrambled about the deck, trying to get the best view of the animals, the captain activated the p.a. system and provided the following nuggets of Otter-specific narration:</span></p>
<ol>
<li class="c4 c5"><span class="c1">Although they live in the water, Sea Otters do not belong to an aquatic genus; they are actually the largest members of the <em>Weasel</em> family.</span></li>
<p></p>
<li><span class="c1">The North Pacific Sea Otter must consume half its body weight in food every day. This means that an average Otter will eat fifty pounds of fresh Alaskan shellfish daily.</span></li>
<p></p>
<li><span class="c1">The Otter has the densest pelt of any mammal alive today. An Otter has between 600,000-800,000 hairs </span><em><span class="c0">per square inch</span></em><span class="c1"> on its body!</span></li>
<p></p>
<li><span class="c1">Unfortunately, the unique quality of Otter pelts was almost their undoing. Otter pelt scarves, hats, and shawls were markers of wealth and status across Europe and Russia. In the early days of Alaska, they were hunted almost to extinction because of the luxurious quality of their furs.</span></li>
<p></p>
<li>Actually, the reason that Russia sold Alaska to the United States in 1867 is that, believing that there were no more Otters left to hunt, they decided that the land wasn’t worth much anymore. So they sold it . . . On account of the otters. Or rather, the perceived paucity thereof.</li>
<p></p>
<li><span class="c1">The plural term for a group of Otters is a </span><em><span class="c0">raft</span></em><span class="c1">. As in, “at the boat’s eleven o’clock, you will see </span><span class="c0">a <em>raft of otters</em></span><span class="c1">.”</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="c4"><strong><span class="c11">B: PASSENGER REACTIONS TO THESE OTTER FACTS</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li class="c4"><span class="c1">The </span><em><span class="c0">weasel</span></em><span class="c1"> family? We would never have guessed! The word weasel—besides bringing to mind the pleasing </span><em><span class="c0">pop!</span></em><span class="c1"> of the children’s song—conjures in the mind’s eye cartoon rodents committing some petty act of larceny against good-natured farm animals. But the otter is not only a </span><em><span class="c0">member</span></em><span class="c1"> of this family, it is its </span><span class="c0">largest</span><span class="c1"> representative. King of the weasels! This is a game changer on the weasel front. We were wrong to judge the entire genus </span><em><span class="c0">weasilicus </span></em><span class="c1">(or whatever the actual term is) for the actions of a few overzealous and cheeky representative species contained therein. If the weasel family is responsible for giving us the otter, then the slate is wiped clean; weasels are fine in our book.</span></li>
<p></p>
<li class="c4"><span class="c1">Fifty pounds of shellfish? How jealous we are of the otter! To think of eating<br />
so much seafood, and of such marvelous freshness, and to not even worry about gaining weight from it because of your prodigious metabolism. Oh, how we wish we had fifty pounds of shellfish. Oh, why did we only bring trail mix and energy bars as snacks? (Note: it is  possible that there were people onboard who were allergic to shellfish; I assume that these cursed souls, while also envious of the otter, had a slightly more cosmic bent to their jealousy. Why, cruel world, can I not eat crab? Why must even the otter, peaceful and adorable in its </span><em><span class="c0">raft</span></em><span class="c1">, remind me of what I am denied by fate and histamines?)</span></li>
<p></p>
<li class="c4"><span class="c1">600,000-800,000? That is a huge number of hairs per square inch, but, it is<br />
impossible for us to process more specifically than this. If the captain had said 50,000 hairs per square inch, that too would have seemed incomprehensibly dense. If he had said ten million (which we now believe to be </span><em><span class="c0">impossibly</span></em><span class="c1"> dense, 100 times as dense as the otter’s pelt, which we now know to be the densest on record) we would have taken it at face value; we would plan to parrot it to people at dinner parties for years to come. To sum up: we know very little about pelt density but for the fact that otters manifest its pinnacle. Further, we are completely dependent on the captain not to mislead us about otter pelt density (a subject which we have become convinced is not trivial) and, for now, we have complete confidence that he will not abuse this sacred charge.</span></li>
<p></p>
<li class="c4"><span class="c1">Upon hearing that word, </span><em><span class="c0">extinction</span></em><span class="c1"><span class="c1"><span class="c1">, we experience all the highs and lows of human existence in the span of 3-4 seconds.<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span class="c1">a) We feel great sadness for the otter, almost wiped from memory under the ignoble stewardship of our shortsighted predecessors. We look at those innocent creatures floating, nay, </span><em><span class="c0">rafting</span></em><span class="c1"> in the water, wanting nothing more than to eat shellfish and to hold their adorable young upon their stomachs, and we wonder how the humans of the past (with whom we share genetics and, assuming a metanarrative view of history, a unifying story of human purpose) could be so cruel and wasteful in their arcane vanity. We wonder if we are doomed to continue their ottercidal violence in our own generation. And then we realize that we do not need to wonder; we remember reading articles and book reviews from scientists who can confirm that we, the human race of the present moment, are absolutely as bad as if not worse than every human who has preceded us. All hope is lost. We too will vanish from the earth and from the memory of all who live upon it. We will be judged by those who come after us to have wasted the sacred gifts of life and of a fertile planet on which to spend it. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span class="c1">b) Conversely. Look at these peculiar and happy creatures in the kelp green water: the otters </span><span class="c0">are <em>not</em></span><span class="c1"><em> extinct</em>. The otters have endured! Buoyed by their giant stocks of shellfish the otters are </span><span class="c0"><em>thriving</em>!</span><span class="c1"> Humanity has not brought slack and ruin upon </span><em><span class="c0">all</span></em><span class="c1"> that it touches! There is still hope!</span></p>
</li>
<li class="c4">Russia sold Alaska to America because they thought there were no more otters? Really? That doesn’t sound completely true. But maybe it’s the fact that it doesn’t sound true that makes it so believable? What a truly peculiar lie that would be! And what would the captain’s incentive be to tell it? No, surely it must be true. In fact, we have never heard a competing explanation as to how America obtained Alaska (nor sought one for that matter). Usually these kinds of things are complex and/or boring and/or involve some kind of depressing conquest; we are refreshed by the eccentric simplicity of the Otter Hypothesis. It is hilarious and satisfying and mildly disturbing, though it is hard to pin down in what proportions. In fact, the entire question requires further analysis.</li>
<p></p>
<li class="c4">A <em><span class="c0">raft </span></em><span class="c1">of otters? How pleasing the English language can be sometimes! How lovely it is when a plural term seems to be mimetic of the group it describes (otters, holding onto each other in the water, </span><em><span class="c0">do</span></em><span class="c1">, after all, resemble a drifting raft). And what about other such terms? A </span><em><span class="c0">grumble</span></em><span class="c1"> of pugs! A </span><em><span class="c0">crash</span></em><span class="c1"> of rhinoceros. A </span><em><span class="c0">gaggle</span></em><span class="c1"> of geese! How fitting that these group nouns should be as diverse and energetic as the animals they describe.</span></li>
<p></p>
<li style="list-style-type: none;"></li>
</ol>
<p class="c4"><span class="c11"><strong>C: DEEP DIVE ON THE OTTER HYPOTHESIS: WHY IS IT SUCH A SATISFYING HISTORICAL NARRATIVE</strong>?</span></p>
<ol>
<li class="c4">Let us set aside the question of its prospective “truth” for the moment; on the boat, we have no means to fact check it. The Otter Hypothesis is a purely discursive construction, perhaps making it a prime example of how theorists like Hayden White think about history. White argues that because history is disseminated through language we should primarily consider it belonging to the realm of discourse, and, that, though history has its own scientific methodology, we primarily understand historical meaning through the same kinds of story structures that are found in literature—tragedy, comedy, farce, romance, etc.—even though it cannot be said that “sets of real events are intrinsically tragic, comic or epic, such that those events as a tragic comic or epic story can be assessed as to its factual accuracy” (392). For White, the same set of events (such as the very real diminishment of the Alaska’s otter population, and the subsequent sale of the territory) are not so much constructed differently by different historians, so much as interpreted as belonging to different plot types. And, because narrative structure is as central to how humans understand the world as language itself, our perception of a historical moment then reflects how we can reconcile the narrative structure used by the historian with the narrative structures available to us in our culture. And so, to understand what makes a historical narrative convincing or satisfying, we must analyze it in literary/rhetorical terms.</li>
<p></p>
<li class="c4"><span class="c1"><span class="c1">How the Otter Hypothesis works as a narrative (independent of history): This is a highly entertaining narrative structure that, similarly to a fable, celebrates the comeuppance of a hubristic villain.</span></span><br />
 	</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span class="c1">a) The Russians are attempting to fleece the hapless Americans into buying what they think to be </span><em><span class="c0">otterless</span></em><span class="c1"> and thus </span><em><span class="c0">worthless</span></em><span class="c1"> land.  This casts them in the role of an unscrupulous used car dealer (perhaps the sort that would be animated as a standard weasel in a hypothetical Disney cartoon history of the event), trying to sell an old woman a station wagon without an engine. The Russians </span><em><span class="c0">know</span></em><span class="c1"> about the otter situation (both the otter scarcity and what this does for the value of the land being discussed) but, owing to their greed and lack of good faith bargaining, they choose to </span><em><span class="c0">conceal</span></em><span class="c1"> this information. If we imagine this as a scene, we are left with complicated diplomatic negotiations in which the Russian contingent spends days sitting across a table from its American counterpart </span><em><span class="c0">struggling to keep a straight face</span></em><span class="c1">, perhaps needing to take periodic breaks just to go outside and privately relieve their laughter at the fraud they are perpetrating. We can picture the sale concluding, and the Russians sailing back to their land, laughing hysterically at their victory, sharing drinks of celebration and exclaiming (I like to imagine) in heavy accents: </span><em><span class="c0">those fools! They paid all this money and they won’t get any otters!</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span class="c1">b) But, of course, the Americans get the last laugh. History proves out that Alaska has a great deal of value (minerals, timber, oil) </span><span class="c0">and <em>otters to boot</em></span><span class="c1">! The shady car dealer has sold an old lady a car with no engine, but, it turns out, </span><span class="c0">the <em>car can fly</em>!</span><span class="c1"> Or, channeling classic fables, we can see a version of Jack and the Beanstalk: the Russians have sold America a handful of beans, and the beans turnout to lead to a golden goose! Setting aside Russia, America, Alaska, or otters, the boat captain’s story takes a classic form that we can easily process as a kind of fable.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="c4"><span class="c1"><span class="c1">As a historical narrative, the Otter Hypothesis offers a unifying theory or “historical metanarrative” for those who would like to find one:</span></span><br />
 	</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span class="c1">a) American exceptionalism: If you are interested in confirming your belief that the United States is the culmination of societal development (and that all that came before led to this shining beacon on a hill) then you could do worse than beginning with America scamming Russia out of Alaska because of some otter confusion. Not only does it establish America as a global power in an era where it was still scuffling to organize itself domestically in the wake of the Civil War, it does so without casting it as an </span><em><span class="c0">imperial</span></em><span class="c1"> power (having so recently overthrown the yoke of an empire in its eponymous revolution). Americans by and large seem to love the idea of American global </span><em><span class="c0">dominance</span></em><span class="c1">, but seem uncomfortable with the idea that we are (or ever have been) a </span><em><span class="c0">colonial</span></em><span class="c1"> power. Under the Otter Hypothesis, it is not the threat of American </span><em><span class="c0">intervention</span></em><span class="c1"> that secures us Alaska; it is the </span><em><span class="c0">guile</span></em><span class="c1"> and foresight of our crafty negotiators who, miraculously, saw past the lure of the otters to the resources of the future that would await them in that rugged northern territory.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span class="c1">i) It is especially significant that this victory was over </span><em><span class="c0">Russia</span></em><span class="c1">, as it allows those who view even 19</span><span class="c15">th</span><span class="c1"> century history through the 20</span><span class="c15">th</span><span class="c1"> century lens of the Cold War to take a unique thrill in knowing that early America triumphed over what would become our greatest (or at least most narratively comprehensible) rival.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span class="c1">ii) Why it is we connect 19</span><span class="c15">th</span><span class="c1"> century human beings with the people who occupied the same space a century later is a more complicated question, but, sticking with the narrative qualities of history, I suppose there is a comfort in connecting the vast swaths of time that precede us with the comparatively miniscule (read: grain of sand in a vast galaxy) time that we occupy, lest we be forced to consider our cosmic irrelevancy.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span class="c1">iii) It is also important that this victory over Russia was, in a way, secured </span><span class="c0">by <em>the</em></span><em><span class="c1"> </span><span class="c0">otters</span></em><span class="c1">. This not only makes the Russian adversaries appear comically unprepared for these negotiations (one can recall the episode of </span><em><span class="c0">Seinfeld</span></em><span class="c1"> where Kramer ruins his chances at a giant monetary settlement from the coffee shop that sold him the scalding coffee, instead requesting all the café lattes he can drink) it suggests that </span><em><span class="c0">nature</span><span class="c1"> </span><span class="c0">itself</span></em><span class="c1"> (as represented in these proceedings by the adorable fur-muppets that are currently listing in the water, angling towards the aft of the boat) is an agent of American success.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span class="c1">iv) It is critical to all of this that the otters have survived. Extinction has a peculiar role in in historical narrative, sometimes seemingly in keeping with Darwinian notions of progress (the Dodo, for example, is seen to have gone extinct due to its own folly and unsuitability to modernity), other times reflecting the worst and most brutal aspects of that same progression (the bison, for example, in its now spectral form, is a signifier of what historical advance destroys; it flags what is lost and not gained as society moves forward). But, if the otters defeated Russia, </span><em><span class="c0">and</span></em><span class="c1"> the otters defeated extinction, then (by American syllogism) the </span><em><span class="c0">Russians</span></em><span class="c1"> were the agents of extinction, and the Americans were not. The otters swim happily before us; this story has no victims.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span class="c1">b) The metanarrative of global capitalism: for many of us, the most interesting part of the story is simply the fact that otter pelts were </span><span class="c0">ever </span><span class="c1">deemed to be so valuable. Not only is this a fun aspect of history (throwing us into an imagined past where one can buy a house with nothing but otter pelts as a down payment… or a strange future where a Russian awakes after 150 years of sleep and coolly walks into a bank with a stack of otter pelts, asking to deposit them), but this system of exchange is so clownishly primitive that it makes us (the spenders of paper </span><span class="c0">money</span><span class="c1">) feel advanced and civilized. In the pre-capitalist wild, otters were skinned and worn decoratively to signify wealth. Now, we have portfolios and digital empires. Clearly, the difference between the otter economy and the contemporary economy is that of an </span><span class="c0">evolution</span><span class="c1"> towards modern capitalism.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span class="c1">c) The metanarrative of the inevitable </span><em><span class="c0">collapse</span></em><span class="c1"> of global capitalism: though I doubt that many people on the boat (all of whom were paying $150 for the pleasure of gazing at glaciers before they melt, while aboard a vessel that was probably doing a mile per gallon if it was lucky) were planning for the fall of capitalism, the otters do offer a glimpse of it. The idea that nations are constructed (and territory apportioned) based on nothing but the availability of resources, and that huge parcels of land (and ostensibly the </span><em><span class="c0">people</span></em><span class="c1"> that inhabited it) could be swapped like trading cards, points to the unsustainability of our system. If otters are that valuable, it is only a matter of time before their scarcity causes a war. If the few hundreds of fur traders are able to control which nation possesses giant tracts of land, then surely they will realize that they have the power, and not the bourgeoisie who wear the pelts (fetish objects of the highest order).</span></p>
</li>
<li class="c4"><span class="c1"><span class="c1"><span class="c1"><span class="c0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The otters also </span><em>refute</em></span><span class="c1"> the notion of a historical meta-narrative:</span></span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span class="c1">a) I mean… they are </span><em><span class="c0">fucking otters</span></em><span class="c1">! Their furry faces can be found in gift shops across Alaska on postcards that say YOU OTTER BE HERE.</span><sup class="c15"><a id="ftnt_ref1" href="#ftnt1">[1]</a></sup><span class="c1"> Nothing could fly more in the face of history conforming to a single coherent linear flow than the notion that such a significant historical event as the sale of Alaska would happen, not because of an intellectual development (e.g. the enlightenment leads to the French Revolution) or because of a great man inspiring his people, but because of a disagreement over the quantity and value of pelagic weasels! </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span class="c1">b) To many onboard (myself included), this thought is oddly comforting. The more chaotic and eclectic the turns of history are, the less unique we are in our feelings of cosmic irrelevancy. The questions and incumbent responsibility that accompany notions of human agency are less daunting in the face of primal entropy. For many of us, the otter is the </span><em><span class="c0">avatar</span></em><span class="c1"> of history: capricious and whimsical.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="c4"><strong><span class="c11">D: FACT CHECKING</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li class="c4"><span class="c1">Are otters weasels? This seems debatable. Otters comprise the taxonomic subgrouping </span><span class="c0">Lutrinae</span><span class="c1">, which appears, by all accounts, to be weasel-free. They are, however, part of a larger group, </span><span class="c0">Mustelidae</span><span class="c1">, that does include weasels, but also includes badgers, minks, and other sundry carnivores. So, unquestionably, otters and weasels are </span><span class="c0">related</span><span class="c1">, but perhaps not as closely as the boat captain implied.</span></li>
<p></p>
<li class="c4"><span class="c1">50 pounds of shellfish a day? The consensus seems to be that otters need to eat 25% of their body weight daily, and that they weigh between 50-100 pounds. This (by my calculations) would put their daily intake at between 12.5-25 pounds. 50 pounds a day thus seems like an exaggeration in excess of a rounding error. Our captain has proved willing to play fast and loose with the truth!</span></li>
<p></p>
<li class="c4"><span class="c1">How dense are their pelts? The same website that informed me of the captain’s exaggerations of otter eating habits (and for the methadologically curious, I googled SEA OTTER FACTS, and clicked on the first link) actually CONFIRMS the captains’s hair claims. In fact, he seems to have undersold the density of the otter’s pelt! The good people at “seaotter-sealion.org” peg the number at 850,000-per square inch! (Whether their .org status gives them an officialdom that outpaces that of “Captain Tim”, or whether their split focus between otters and sea lions makes them </span><span class="c0">less</span><span class="c1"> credible, are questions I leave to the reader.)</span></li>
<p></p>
<li class="c4"><span class="c1">The sad history of otter trapping seems indisputable. Whether or not the decimation of sea otter populations in Alaska motivated the Russian decision to sell it, there seems to be no question that it affected their operations in the territory, as the population dwindled to such low numbers that it sent the trappers—a class referred to in the liturature as the “promyshlenniki”—to head south on the coast towards California. Additionally, the conservationists who organized the 1911 Fur Seal Treaty believed there to be roughly fifty animals alive at the time of its inception. No doubt, the otters we witnessed in the water on that day had narrowly avoided perdition.</span></li>
<p> 	</p>
<li class="c4"><span class="c1">Why did Russia sell Alaska? And how much did otters have to do with it? Okay. This is where it gets a bit complicated.</span><br />
 	</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span class="c1">a) The consensus seems to be that there were other, much more important factors than the lack of otters in Russia’s decision to sell Alaska. In fact most of the evidence points to two primary factors: the inability of Russia to defend the Alaskan territory in the event it was challenged (something that seemed inevitable given the promises of the Monroe Doctrine), and the need to allocate scarce debts to other imperial projects (such as paying the debts of the Crimean war, and defending territory in southeast Asia). Under this interpretation, Russia saw the loss of Alaska to be inevitable (they did, after all, have fewer than 1,000 representatives on the ground there), and undertook the sale to save face and to cut their losses (Bolkhovitinov  91). This seems like an eminently reasonable explanation (albeit not nearly as entertaining and satisfying as the Otter Hypothesis).</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span class="c1">b) This does not mean that there is no scholarly disagreement. In fact, it has been a subject of much disagreement, especially on the Russian side. Some thought the Tsar’s officials had been </span><span class="c0">bribed—</span><span class="c1">with otter pelts?—into accepting such an unfavorable sale (Bolkhovitinov 92), while others took the kinder view that the Tsar had just been foolish and incompetent (Bolkhovitinov  93). Some even claim that the original sale was actually a </span><span class="c0">loan</span><span class="c1">, and counted down to the days that Russia would reclaim Alaska (no doubt making Sarah Palin’s day as she gleefully scrambled the national guard, should she still have been in office), though there seems to be little government momentum for persuing such a claim. These debates, once hotly contested in certain Russian historical circles, now seem settled, and Nikolai Bolkhovitinov’s views seem to have taken hold. (His essay is worth reading simply for his scathing indictments of his opponent’s methodology on their own. One wonders if, among historians, this kind of invective functions as a seemingly civil stand in for the obscenities they might want to hurl: </span><span class="c0">your mother didn’t properly document her sources!</span><span class="c1"> Etc.) </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span class="c1">c) There also seems to be clear refutation of the implication that Russia thought that Alaska had no value without otters. In fact, Soviet historian S.B. Okun wrote that “it was impossible to protect [Alaska] from the widespread rumors concerning the presence of gold” (92), that partially motivated the sale. Russia knew that the territory had great value, with or without otters. (Though, they also knew that they had little on-hand infrastructure to reap those resources; unlike otter hunting, mining and logging required huge amounts of manpower and capital.)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span class="c1">d) Among all of the sources I was able to find, only one backed up Captain Tim’s sea otter hypothesis. Here is the passage: “But as sea otters became less numerous along the coast of North America, Russia placed less value on the settlements it had established to support hunting, setting the stage for U.S. Secretary of State William Seward to buy the Alaska territory for $7.2 million in 1867.” Pretty compelling? Perhaps conflating correlation with causation, but isn’t that was the whole historical game is about? Assigning causality? However, it is hard not to notice that this single bit of evidence comes not from a peer reviewed historical journal, but from a website called “Seaotters.com.” It is possible that in </span><span class="c0">their</span><span class="c1"> metanarrative, otters play a somewhat over-determined role. If forced to render a judgment, I would have to say that the Otter Hypothesis does not seem </span><span class="c0">particularly </span><span class="c1">true.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span class="c1">e) And yet.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span class="c1">i) Strangely, one cannot separate the Otter Hypothesis’ likely falsehood from its initial seeming plausibility. If anything, it struck us as true </span><span class="c0">precisely</span><span class="c1"> </span><span class="c0">because</span><span class="c1"> it seemed too weird to make up. It seemed like the odd quirk of history that confirms life’s chaotic essence.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span class="c1">ii) Regardless of how it fails as capital ‘H’ “History” (overdetermined metanarrative) or event lower case ‘h’ history’ (a small record of a particular event, as it was), the Otter Hypothesis seems true to how we want to tell history and how we want to hear it. Captain Tim did not come up with this story, nor do I accuse him of knowingly <span class="c1">transmitting something partially false.</span><sup class="c15"><a id="ftnt_ref2" href="#ftnt2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c1"> But he judged, perfectly, what we wanted. As an audience of stories, humans seem to like simple historical narratives but not stories of simple causality. In history, as in literature, narrative convenience is unconvincing. The Otter Hypothesis is the perfect combination of simplicity (one factor: otters) and complexity (the one factor defies our expectations).</span></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span class="c1">iii) The Otter Hypothesis also reflects a central element of </span><span class="c0">American</span><span class="c1"> history: that we want the sausage but don’t want to see how it was made. We want the spoils but not to be seen doing the spoiling. Our entitlement extends beyond material surplus; we seem to covet narratives that confirm we deserve it.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span class="c1">iv) Are we sure the otter story isn’t true? Otters were slaughtered; this did change Russia’s position in Alaska. That change culminated in the territory being sold. White says that there is no intrinsic plot to events. Causality seems almost inevitably overdetermined. And so, perhaps the Otter Hypothesis is no</span><span class="c0"> less</span><span class="c1"> true than any other overdetermined narrative?</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span class="c1">v) A professor of mine once told me that, in the face of nebulous historical causation, a historian has three options. She can make an argument for causation (elevating a single factor), identify and depict a </span><span class="c0">moment</span><span class="c1"> where the historical change can best be described (whether or not this clarifies causation), or she can find a symbolic moment that describes the transition: a kind of objective correlative (to use the literary term) that externalizes the historical moment.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span class="c1">vi) I think that the Otter Hypothesis succeeds in the third count. This period of American history was one characterized by violence and wildness masked as statecraft. The idea that Alaska would be sold because of a lack of otters feels true to the chaos of the moment. And, in its synthesis of historical chaos and pleasing overdetermination I think it is also the perfect correlative for historiography.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span class="c1">vii) I don’t think the otters give a fuck way or another. In this way, the Otter Hypothesis also reflects a central tension in environmental history: do we consign the environment to the background of human behavior, or do we endow it with agency (and thus an agenda) to drive our actions?</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span class="c1">viii) I don’t think the otters would really give a fuck about that question either.</span></p>

<li class="c4"><span class="c1">The proper term for a group of otters is actually a </span><span class="c0">romp</span><span class="c1">, not a </span><span class="c0">raft</span><span class="c1">.</span><br />
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span class="c1">a) That’s kind of a bummer. </span><span class="c0">Raft</span><span class="c1"> is such a perfect term. I wish that were true.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span class="c1">b) I guess </span><span class="c0">Romp</span><span class="c1"> is pretty good too.</span></p>

He was down on the dock, and his smoking was holding us up. Captain Tim told him to stop smoking so we could go, and the man responded by throwing the cigarette into the water (an environmental no-no). The man saw Captain Tim’s look of disapproval and, with an entitled tone, yelled up at him “what do you expect me to do?” Captain Tim responded, without hesitation: “I expect you to be a man, put it out on your palm, and get on the fucking boat!”</span></p>
