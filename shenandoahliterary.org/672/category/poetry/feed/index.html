								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This train is bound for glory, this train . . .<br />
</em>comes in the voices of fellowship<br />
from the Holiness Refuge Tabernacle<br />
on the Hill. Rooted in a road-side gully,<br />
a salt-loving wild morning glory<br />
has set out bearing crimson flowers.<br />
Leaves tremble in the trade wind, all notched<br />
like a hoof, or heart, the vine bound for<br />
the Great Salt Pond atop a dormant<br />
underground volcano. Runaway slaves<br />
were drowned there in chains, the pond<br />
a ledger in which the master entered<br />
profits and losses. Seeds float from the vine<br />
to live forever, returning faithfully<br />
to gullies and waste ground<br />
in spindrift blown from the pond.<br />
It’s the glory this train is bound for.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em> </em><em>-Catalpa speciosa</em></p>
<p>-March 26, 1951</p>
<p>How long have they idled, motor throttled<br />
down, off the two-track, at rest on snow-crust<br />
in his ’47 Dodge, its chrome bumper,<br />
its yellow fog lamps, facing the catalpa tree,<br />
the heater madly whirring against<br />
a night gone entirely cold?<br />
The man at the wheel is her first husband,<br />
the woman who will soon enough<br />
be my mother is seated beside his body,<br />
hand lifting to her lip-sticked mouth,<br />
the air in the Dodge so lit, fully blown<br />
of gun-powder, of sloe gin and cotton wadding,<br />
a waxy shell ejected, clattering<br />
against the right-side dash.<br />
She has bruised an ear drum, she says,<br />
from the blast of that .12 gauge, hammered<br />
flat at close range. This, the shock,<br />
her bedlamic shriek, will muddle her<br />
thoughts, make it hard to hear the coroner,<br />
to understand the parish priest,<br />
to weep sincerely, some whisper, until<br />
his baffled parents order a marker<br />
from the VFW, and drive back to Terre Haute.<br />
How did the pump-action shotgun,<br />
cut to riot-length, its butt at-rest<br />
in the rear foot-well, its coal-blue barrel<br />
angled at the driver’s side of the bench seat—<br />
go off? Who clicked three shells into the magazine,<br />
who racked the pump, and was the safety on?<br />
The detectives who rumble out, sirens<br />
wailing, from the far-off county seat,<br />
who swaddle her in wool blankets,<br />
who smoke Luckies and toe them deftly<br />
into the snow, who light-up her footprints<br />
with flashbulbs and prowl-car spots—<br />
they want only sensible geometry<br />
and a few hard facts, but she cannot say<br />
why her husband placed the shotgun like-so,<br />
why they idled, motor lowing, so long into the dark,<br />
why his cob-yellow brains and bits<br />
of seat-fluff stipple her tight pink sweater<br />
and the blown-out windshield, or why,<br />
high above them, the wintered seed pods<br />
of the catalpa tree—longish, thin,<br />
but for where the adamantine seeds swell<br />
the pods’ tobacco-brown casings—<br />
are splattered with the song-less tongue<br />
and silent lips of that long-rumored,<br />
half-hearted man.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are driving through our laments for<br />
what this town has become, almost lost though we turn</p>
<p>routes so familiar I hardly need to steer. The clubs gutted<br />
to build shops and chain restaurants, the all-night diner</p>
<p>where I once drank coffee and watched the world shrink into light<br />
a condo now, the bowling alley beside campus a Target</p>
<p>where students can buy gym shorts and toilet paper, all these lead<br />
to a recital of what stood in  each non-existent building</p>
<p>and remade space. Without speaking, we are steering out of town,<br />
along a two-lane road still robed in shade, trees pressed</p>
<p>close to the road’s blunt shoulder, lower limbs bend groundward<br />
like animals come to drink at an oasis. Then</p>
<p>the road widens and light splashes the asphalt, the wall of trees<br />
broken to reveal a cut clear, still littered with tree trunks</p>
<p>lying askew, broken limbs dangling, casualties of the ongoing battle<br />
between space and commerce. And beyond, houses, all twinned</p>
<p>in their sameness. I slow the car. No evidence anyone lives here.<br />
No one mowing or pulling weeds from beds uniformly mulched</p>
<p>in pine bark. No kids shooting baskets or riding bikes. My brother and<br />
his ex- dwelled for a while on a similar street. I had to count</p>
<p>doors to find their place. The fourth one on the left. Or maybe<br />
the sixth. When I moved here, this road was barely paved, a path</p>
<p>through trees, its few houses hidden by pin oak and pines. A good place<br />
to lead an invisible life. Now, slashes of orange paint color</p>
<p>the ground, sign that this road is due to be widened, repaved. A decade ago,<br />
when our daughter would only nap in the car, I would</p>
<p>drive this road and a maze of others, circling the satellite towns of<br />
the county before the bosses began building glass towers</p>
<p>that shine like new needles, even at might. Ground is broken, then come<br />
carpenters, masons, crane operators, craftsmen who will never</p>
<p>walk the rich carpets that will fill halls that exist only on paper now<br />
or “take a meeting” around tables as big as a front porch.</p>
<p>Then come computer jocks, software manipulators with their needs for<br />
Thai food, bike lanes, fair trade coffee. Now restaurants can</p>
<p>charge eighteen bucks for an appetizer. The bar where I got drunk for<br />
the last time is a lot loaded with earth movers now. Past the colony</p>
<p>of still-life houses, we see a mailbox, its top half crowned by the dome<br />
of a skull, the bottom adorned by jawbone, so opening the mailbox</p>
<p>offers the illusion of a skull yawning for reasons, both good and evil.<br />
In the side yard, a windmill, not built of angle iron, curved blades</p>
<p>dicing the wind, but something from a book a child reads, built of wood,<br />
its tiny windows leaded into diamond shapes. I’d call it</p>
<p>life-sized, but how many in recent years have seen such a thing?<br />
Let’s say it was large enough for its job. Which, right now, is</p>
<p>pulling our attention from the road as we slow and then pull over,<br />
the car slanted on a shallow ditch bank, our bodies still as the street</p>
<p>we just passed. No matter how motionless our bones, time continues<br />
its slow walk forward, stubborn as a morning runner who knows</p>
<p>the limits of his aging legs but keeps his dogged pace. Time will roll over<br />
all our wishes for the past to hold. We need to breathe deeply enough</p>
<p>to appreciate the allotment of days we treat like the abandoned houses<br />
of our youth, places to be occupied, then destroyed. Denied</p>
<p>a last drink, I stood outside the loud bar, emptied, feeling the start that would<br />
change. And keep changing. If this was a poem, if I was a wiser man,</p>
<p>I’d find some explanation for what it all means, lessons from a self-created<br />
Virgil or just myself in the guise of a man almost whole. But</p>
<p>I’m just a man sitting beside his wife, staring at something I’ll never have<br />
the patience or skill to make. Maybe once I would have bent close enough</p>
<p>to draw a brush over each plane of wood, coloring each ne to contrast<br />
its neighbors, each an irreplaceable part of the whole. The lie bosses tell</p>
<p>workers until they falter. But the windmill, with its ability to snare the eye<br />
echoes a more cautious time, when painting a structure or sanding</p>
<p>a piece of wood correctly meant something. While we stare, the eyes in the skull<br />
flash red, little hazard lights, a caution that someone is watching,</p>
<p>pulling us from what thickens in the capsule of our car: how easily we have<br />
dreamed ourselves into this place, a paradise artificial</p>
<p>as the new structures we curse but can’t stop from coming. We drive away,<br />
accelerating back into our lives, returning to our porch where we see</p>
<p>cranes above the trees, busy at the rebuilding there is no end of.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>But there is no crash or shatter.<br />
Only a hush, a slow rousing,<br />
the eider ducks’ merest mutterings.<br />
Light seeps into the sky</p>
<p>as though leaking from unfurled<br />
fingers, and here, delivered<br />
on an open palm, the bay against the sky<br />
a margin of incandescence.</p>
<p>One by one, larks vie<br />
for most intricate solo. An onshore wind,<br />
helping things along, articulates<br />
snaking ribbons of tidal current.</p>
<p>I, too, almost inexorably, start<br />
to move into morning tasks, projects<br />
I may not finish before this day’s lingering<br />
is extinguished. But how abrupt</p>
<p>the radio’s news reminds me<br />
that elsewhere on this insistent, revolving planet,<br />
one more war lifts its head, awakened<br />
or having never slept. In some other place,</p>
<p>in its morning’s first scattering light<br />
bereft of bird-song and leaf-toss,<br />
a village is blasted into rubble,<br />
and a soldier, too young to have to know</p>
<p>such despair, dodges crosshairs.<br />
A short while ago, he shrugged off half<br />
a moon. Now he goes down with half a face<br />
as all around him, day breaks.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>. . . if I find your grief exceeds due measure I shall be more greatly distressed than by the misfortune itself.    &#8212; Plutarch</p></blockquote>
<p>Upon learning of Timoxena’s death,<br />
unable to write her name until late<br />
in his letter, he asked his wife this favor:</p>
<p>Do not let your grief exceed due measure.<br />
Death is no more than one’s state before birth.<br />
There was no grief before our daughter came.<br />
Why should we grieve now that she is gone?<br />
All that has passed is a two-year life,<br />
eight seasons of small delights.<br />
Should such a gift be mourned?<br />
And a life so brief the soul lacked time<br />
to stiffen into a mold she would find<br />
difficult to shed. You ask me how<br />
one measures pain, how one bottles<br />
tides. Dear wife, this is virtue’s test.<br />
Let us grieve quietly, together, alone.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday afternoon, my wife taught me<br />
blueberry plants come with all the parts<br />
they need to bear fruit, both male and female.</p>
<p>To get one full of berries, though, you need<br />
to plant it right next to some blueberries<br />
from a different family. The only way they’ll fill</p>
<p>with blossoms and fruit is to cross pollinate.<br />
Swarms of bees bring the goods from one plant<br />
to the next, and the lot grow healthy and prosper.</p>
<p>Two plants, a small garden, and enough bees<br />
to outlast our dog’s urge to snap them<br />
out of the air as they fly from bloom to bloom.</p>
<p>Such a simple equation, this. So sensical<br />
that togetherness, time, and a little help<br />
will fill our bowls to overflowing.</p>

tightwadding breath, blocking off<br />
thought and the light in the kitchen, the road<br />

<p>As if the heart were a weapon formed<br />
against you, an enemy at the gate<br />
and not the lone runner from the outskirts<br />
bent under the weight, the gravity of the word<br />
she carried, collapsing at your back door,<br />
the body’s crumple the only<br />
word she can muster.<br />
As if she herself<br />
were not breaking.</p>
<p>As if she were not your own<br />
truest self, there in your kitchen in the morning,<br />
nor the open windows<br />
of your daughter’s house down the road.<br />
As if your heart were not, for you, the whole<br />
soft breath of May,<br />
and everything else<br />
of this world<br />
you’ve known along the way.</p>

determined, wings spread.</p>
<p>Today I cut through a parking lot to follow it,<br />
walked along the pines beyond my neighborhood.<br />
I took my camera there.</p>
<p>It was as if it waited just for me,<br />
its feathers ruffled by the wind.<br />
I wanted to spread my hands and bury them</p>
<p>beneath the black and white and rust,<br />
a red-shouldered, the face so pleasing,<br />
I might have fallen in.</p>
<p>But the hawk’s eyes went bright,<br />
then locked, and when it flew,<br />
the man at the church across the lot</p>
<p>raised his dark arms.  <em>Did you get it?  Did you?<br />
</em>I lifted my camera and my pale hand,<br />
“Yes. Beautiful!” and turned.  I felt the river</p>
<p>between us, like a stream of hardship.<br />
We couldn’t see it, but it was there,<br />
and still we cheered.</p>
<p>Our voices signaled to the smaller birds<br />
tucked in the brush.  The hawk long gone,<br />
and as always everywhere.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Standish sacked Merrymount<br />
and drove the heathens out.<br />
Not to be outdone,<br />
Endicott the iconoclast<br />
came for the crumbs,<br />
leveling what was left<br />
of a maypole on its hill.<br />
I remember<br />
in darksome Devonshire<br />
many a maid in May<br />
wound round the bole.<br />
We frolicked and sang<br />
and crowned the white queen<br />
and pranked ourselves up<br />
with cowslip and crowfoot.<br />
We sported and shot<br />
to our hearts’ content,<br />
brave boys less intent<br />
on prayer than merriment,<br />
innocent of our sin,<br />
of the very word <em>pagan</em>—<br />
unlike that boisterous company<br />
that called itself merry,<br />
rogues their lord Morton<br />
like some antichrist<br />
suffered to free<br />
unto slavery<br />
to nature and appetite,<br />
bandettos and squaws<br />
that knew no laws<br />
or limits to their revelry<br />
(our holiday lasted<br />
but a few blasted<br />
days).—Still, when I read<br />
of Solomon’s green beds<br />
and rafters of fir,<br />
I remember.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mr. Warham’s first sea storm<br />
I sat with him in his chambers.<br />
We read together the Psalm<br />
about them that go down<br />
to the sea in ships. He was far<br />
he said, looking green,<br />
from having list to sleep<br />
with Jonah. I said it seldom<br />
falls out that a ship perisheth<br />
at storm if it have sea room.<br />
So he began to call his study<br />
his sea room. I told him<br />
about different names for gales—<br />
the dainty loom that was gentle<br />
and the fair frum as fit<br />
as a wind could blow.<br />
Becalmed the next morning,<br />
I said your prayers were heard.<br />
He said aye that sometimes<br />
it was all or nothing with the Lord,<br />
that when it rained it poured.<br />
I said aye we’re better off now<br />
walking the plain and even meadow,<br />
had we the feet for it.<br />
In a fog we fumbled about<br />
like a blind man he said,<br />
as we drummed for <em>The</em> <em>Lion<br />
</em><em>Whelp</em> and sounded with a line<br />
above a hundred fathom<br />
and found not bottom.<br />
He likened whales’ backs<br />
to little isles and said<br />
that islands in a fog were like to whales.<br />
And what’s a ship but an island,<br />
and isn’t it true we’re riding<br />
on the backs of whales ourselves,<br />
or else in their bellies?<br />
Pouring off water, the flukes<br />
of right whales rose like angels<br />
as they dove. Behold,<br />
they mount up to the heaven<br />
said the Reverend.<br />
They go down again to the depths.<br />
He thought the bladderwrack<br />
knit yellow above the bank<br />
were gillyflowers gleaned<br />
from the low meadows<br />
of New Jerusalem.<br />
Everything touched<br />
by his words was renewed.<br />
I hadn’t the heart to tell him.</p>
