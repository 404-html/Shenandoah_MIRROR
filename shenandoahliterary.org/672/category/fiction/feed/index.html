								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Michael Bonacci died the night of the Father-Daughter Dinner Dance.&nbsp; He died at home in his bathroom.&nbsp; Technically, it was the next day.&nbsp; Like Cinderella, Michael might have joked, he expired just after midnight, his lungs filled, his heart aflutter, his mind plunged into the cold black expanse.</p>
<p>He was sober when he got up that morning at five. &nbsp;He walked in the dark to the bathroom, feeling his left hand out for the door frame, then the wall, then the light switch that he did not turn on because his wife was sleeping. &nbsp;By five thirty, he sat in one of the club chairs in his study, feet off the floor and tucked, arms resting in his lap, counting breaths. &nbsp;He started over when he got to ten, beginning to let go. &nbsp;Then, for the fifth time that week, he was interrupted by the paper woman’s headlights. &nbsp;They spoiled the darkness, sliding along his study wall, slowly at first, and then quickly as the white hatchback passed and the high beams flashed across his face.&nbsp; It was annoying to him that after a year and a half, she still paused in front of houses that had never received the paper.</p>
<p>Michael was at the window when the woman drove back around from the end of the cul-de-sac, snailing past each house. &nbsp;A deep manvoice exuded from the hatchback and drifted over his lawn, past the tired maple, reaching his ear as an undertow of chopped sound. &nbsp;She was probably in her late sixties, drove through their neighborhood on the wrong side of the road each morning, paused often to study what must have been a list of addresses written with a shaky hand.&nbsp; Even after her car passed and was no longer visible, her brake lights dashed any hope of recovering his meditation.&nbsp; Michael shook his head and felt old frustrations rising.&nbsp; Better to have a fresh-faced kid, like it used to be, he thought, beating down the street on a bike, pitching the morning papers for strikes, the large canvas strap of the bag full of news slung diagonally across his chest, maybe a baseball cap turned backwards so the wind wouldn’t blow it off.&nbsp; One nickel in his pocket for every dollar tossed.&nbsp; It struck him as he stood there that he had not seen a paperboy in twenty years.&nbsp; Where had they all gone?&nbsp; His thoughts went back to the old woman who drove the paper route in her used car.&nbsp; She looked to be in her late sixties and was driving every morning in the dark before the crack of dawn.&nbsp; She could not keep her houses straight, she delivered a dying medium, and she worked a job once reserved for kids.</p>
<p>Michael’s annoyance transferred from the paper woman to the circumstances that he started imagining had brought her to his neighborhood each morning in the twilight of her life.&nbsp; Then he noticed himself in the reflection of the window as the red afterglow disappeared. &nbsp;He had lost fifteen pounds during the first thirty days of sobriety in a combination of exercise and abstinence. &nbsp;Today was day number forty.&nbsp; He left the window and went to find his running shoes, thinking about himself and where he fell on the line between the paperboys and the old woman.&nbsp; I am an old woman, he thought and laughed at himself, remembering those words from a John Prine song, though the name of the song escaped him at the moment.</p>
<p>As he stooped to tie his shoes, his mind already was racing again, and he thought about whether he was going to have a drink at the dinner dance that night. &nbsp;He pictured the drink, the martini glass filled with ice cubes bathed in water to chill while the gin was poured into a silver shaker, more ice packed, shaken hard and carefully set aside, the ice water emptied from the martini glass, and then the smooth pour, the gin chilled so that it seems to stack along the slanted sides of the glass almost like shaved-ice slush, until it filled from the bottom and the last drops were coaxed out by the bartender’s smooth tapping finger, the final fat olive speared and perched toward on the rim, a whisper of vermouth creating a liquid plume in the near-frozen gin.</p>
<p>A week or two ago, Michael’s wife had suggested a journal to help with the anger that came on when he quit. Her therapist recommended journaling, she said. It was the opposite of what you assumed, he thought. When he drank, he felt warm and content, not violent. But the edge was there when he was sober; he felt that nobody listened unless he yelled. &nbsp;When he was drunk, he didn’t care if anyone listened or not.&nbsp; Write about that, his wife suggested the morning after they argued deep into the night and he had thrown the coffee grinder to make a point, cracking the plastic.&nbsp; Michael hated the idea of fixating on himself in writing, scribbling like some mad man under the glow of an electric lamp, the scratch of the pen feeling all wrong and akin to crumpled paper. &nbsp;But he had started the argument that night and she left a journal and a blue ink pen beside a note in the kitchen. He decided he would not write about himself, but set out to write bad poetry.</p>
<p>“What did the Bard write when he retired down at that river town?” Michael wrote one morning.&nbsp; “What did he read if he could not read his own Upon Avon?”</p>
<p>He continued:</p>
<p>Imagine long walks,<br />
Perhaps with a cane, perhaps<br />
With a wife, or a dashing young boy,<br />
Lean and willing, but writing nothing, playing nothing, keeping up with precisely<br />
Nothing.<br />
Painful to remain silent and be thought the fool,<br />
He remembered, than to speak and,<br />
Without regret, remove all doubt droll-fully.</p>
<p>Bad poetry helped. It was like betting against your favorite team. &nbsp;You could not lose. &nbsp;If they lost, you won. &nbsp;If they won, you didn’t care that you lost. &nbsp;Bad poetry had saved him once before. &nbsp;Just out of college, his first job since working construction in summers, he lived at the end of a hall of tenth grade boys in a dorm at a New England boarding school, a teaching fellow. &nbsp;His window overlooked a small mound with a circle of green saplings, a hedgerow, and a boundary of older trees that lined a gravel lane connecting the campus to a cornfield. &nbsp;He could see a portion of one of the fields in the distance through the gap the road created.&nbsp; He arrived on campus at the end of summer when the corn had not yet been harvested and the sky stirred pungent with moisture in the late afternoons.</p>
<p>Michael ran, sometimes, down the gravel lane that swung through the farmer’s fields and around the farmhouse and emerged eventually on the state highway a mile or so north of campus. &nbsp;From there, he could double back, which he often did, or if he was feeling adventurous and strong, which he started to feel in full autumn when the football conference games arrived and the charter buses rumbled through campus to tour the fall foliage, then he would cross the highway and venture on the trails that zigzagged across the mountains, foothills really, and old logging roads that were maintained more or less for hikers and runners and snow mobiles and, he assumed, the late winter assault on the maple trees for sap when snow still covered the ground.</p>
<p>These trails were steep and upkeep varied. &nbsp;Somehow he felt he could run farther when the terrain was unstable and he was forced to concentrate not on whether he had run a mile or more, but whether he was putting his foot in the right location, whether the rock was going to slide, whether the leaves covered a hole or something else tricky to traverse, whether a branch was going to slap him in the face. &nbsp;Time warped on the mountain trails, the sunlight became something tangible, stabbing through the autumn leaves, catching the tree dust and suspended woodland air that he could not see, but that seemed thick until a gust of wind swept through and swirled it clean. &nbsp;He wrote a bad poem about this. &nbsp;He wrote bad poetry about his students, his college girlfriend, his terrible JV soccer team, his morning commute on foot across the campus from his dorm near the river to the main buildings, over the field where ice formed on a foot of snow so that it bruised his shins when his feet busted through the crusted layer.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>On the morning of the day Michael died, he wrote a bad poem about a door that was carved and hung for the first time on a New England home in 1797. &nbsp;“There is something that doesn’t love a door,” he began. &nbsp;Then he turned his attention to the azalea bush outside of his study windows, thriving in the humid city he had migrated to shortly after law school. &nbsp;The bush had been anemic all fall, just beyond the shade of the maple, barely getting enough to drink.</p>
<p>The sprinkler system needed an update. &nbsp;A pipe, he thought, must have split somewhere under his yard, out of sight, pressure released, system fail. &nbsp;But the bush held despite a few mornings where it looked brittle, sapped, and tired. &nbsp;There had been rain that winter, a small flood, and general dampness into the New Year. &nbsp;The bush revived. By mid- February, the bush had leaves and during a few days of eighty-degree weather, unseasonably hot in February by historic measures, even for Houston, the bush grew buds and one of those buds even flowered into delicate white, tissue-like pedals.</p>
<p>His wife would find the poem several weeks after his death. &nbsp;She would read it once, misunderstand the triggers, find meaning where there was none, and save the notebook for the remainder of her long life, even after she remarried and moved east for her second husband’s career on Capitol Hill, even after he, too, died and she moved back to Texas where she had been born and was raised and where she still had a few old friends to talk to on the patio of the old club where the grandkids could order Shirley Temples and she could enjoy the sound of babies with their mothers.&nbsp; She would not remember the bruises on shins from ice in spring.&nbsp; She would not recall the smell of the mountain laurel on those long, crisp afternoons amid the buckets that were nailed to the trees like suckling tin dolls to gather the oozing sap that yet was weeks away.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Michael started his run with the memory of those New England jogs still fresh in his mind and his bad poetry safely tucked in his study drawer. &nbsp;He knew the club would look perfect for the dinner dance that evening. &nbsp;The uniformed men waiting at the valet, the sweep of stair, the bone white columns, the intimate foyer where some would mingle and greet, cocktail in hand, waiter and waitress staff gliding with small round trays of wine, beef tartar on crusty baguette slices, escargot. &nbsp;Through the open double doors into the grand ballroom, the big band would be poised and the polished wooden floors would glow beneath the crystal chandeliers ready for light and festive feet.&nbsp; The men would wear white tie, their daughters, semi-ball gowns.&nbsp; If he chose, it would be his first drink in forty days.</p>
<p>Michael recalled the first time he had inhaled wealth, back east—a towel of all things, thick and luxurious. &nbsp;He had stayed with an aunt who was not rich but who lived in a resort community while her husband struggled as an architect.&nbsp; The aunt and uncle had access to a club through his university. &nbsp;They took Michael to the resort on his uncle’s days off. &nbsp;The towels were at the entrance. &nbsp;They were stacked, ten high and three rows back, on a low shelf beneath the shade of a cabana. &nbsp;Michael reached for one, noticing nothing else until he heard a clicking tongue, and looked up to see a boy, just a year or two older, forming a big, wide grin. &nbsp;The older boy held out an identical towel from another stack, this one beside a director’s chair where the boy was perched. &nbsp;Michael felt himself flush beneath the boy’s gaze. &nbsp;Unlike the summer pool back home, this place was quiet. &nbsp;There was no off-the-reservation laughter, no country music piped in from suspended speakers, no mother shouting for her child to come on back and get some sunscreen on before he turned lobster—just the cool, soft-spoken hush of wealth.</p>
<p>Michael nodded at the boy as he took the towel, feeling its weight, sensing the boy watching him and passing through the gaze to the other side, where the spell was snapped as quickly as it had arrived, first by his uncle who mocked one of the sunbathing men wearing a gold chain, and then by his aunt who followed, a bit overweight, a bit underdressed, and laughing a bit too loud at his uncle’s crooked smiles.</p>
<p>His aunt and uncle ordered Old Fashioneds poolside. &nbsp;The name seemed perfect to Michael when he saw them, the cherry lodged in maple-colored crystal like a mosquito caught in amber from one of the National Geographic magazines his grandparents subscribed to him.</p>
<p>Only one way to go, Michael thought, remembering his aunt and uncle, their white skin and floppy hats, their short limbs reclining in the sun, the umbrella, never quite perched in the right location to protect all the three vitals—their bodies, their drinks, their beach bag that looked more like a canvas grocery sack. &nbsp;And so the drinks remained shaded, cool, iced, and well-tended by the young waiters who strolled from umbrella to umbrella, chair to chair, group to group.&nbsp; And the beach bags faded and Michael got his first bad sunburn of his life that he could recall.</p>
<p>Bad Poem, No. 34 By Michael</p>
<p>Late autumn days when the Pilgrims recalled the harvest,<br />
The Pequot raced for game, and signs of winter torched the breeze<br />
That slightly sounded so all could see that summer’s laze had shrunk.<br />
Down here, winter’s hints, they never come. The breeze it flies<br />
From the Gulf that is thick with preludes, grand storms, salt<br />
To delta mud, like whiskey, heat so thick it coats the gravy sky.</p>
<p>After his run, wet with sweat, Michael walked back to his bedroom where his wife was still laying down. &nbsp;One of the children, their youngest, had made his way from his bed to theirs, and was snoozing with his worn, stuffed elephant, his fingers in his mouth, always two fingers rather than a thumb. &nbsp;She was reading a novel, a paperback with seashells on the cover that her sister had discarded. &nbsp;&nbsp;On his side of the bed, magazines were stacked, a measure of the months, dusty to the touch perhaps, but not visibly. &nbsp;There was something slightly worn about the magazines, so different from when each arrived, as if pressed, smooth, and surprising. &nbsp;By the bed, they were picked over and smudged.&nbsp; He headed for the shower.</p>
<p>From the time he took a shower until lunch when he ate a hotdog with his daughter and his son at Weenie Stand Number Three, Michael moved through his punch list of odd jobs around the house. &nbsp;The garage door opener needed a new fuse. &nbsp;The hole that the dog had dug and that Michael had filled with sand and dirt and planted with grass was, by some great mystery, a hole again. &nbsp;The sprinkler system needed to be repaired to ensure the survival of the azalea bush so that it, in turn, could inspire more bad poetry. &nbsp;He completed exactly none of those tasks, but managed to read an article about the mathematical connection between the mating rituals of rabbits, the syllables in Sanskrit poetry, and the shape of his ears. &nbsp;In reality, Michael was just biding his time until his wife got back from the morning basketball games with the kids so that he could escape with them from the house for hotdogs and the park.</p>
<p>“Why do you put coleslaw on your hotdog?” his daughter asked. “That’s disgusting.”</p>
<p>“That’s the only way to eat a hotdog,” he answered.</p>
<p>She looked at him and sighed, and he thought how it was just recently that she had learned to sigh.&nbsp; It wasn’t clear to him whether she had mastered it, though she seemed to have innate talent.</p>
<p>“Sometimes,” he said, “I put chili on it, and relish, too.”</p>
<p>“That’s really disgusting,” she said and bit into her own hotdog, dressed only in ketchup.</p>
<p>They went to a park near their house. &nbsp;Thirty years earlier, the land had been a vast field and men sometimes walked with dogs and shotguns to hunt dove or quail.&nbsp; He thought about this as he sat on a bench, watching his son run around a playhouse, pausing every now and then to pick up an armful of wood chips that carpeted the area and throw them in the air, laughing.&nbsp; His daughter played on a seesaw with a girl half her age, gently pushing the plank up for the girl whose legs did not reach the ground, even on the downside.</p>
<p>The park stretched out toward a block of houses, clipped grass and a few trees here and there.&nbsp; There was a baseball diamond at the far end, a basketball court, and a pair of tennis courts where neighborhood kids met private coaches to practice their serves. &nbsp;On days when the wind blew in from the Gulf or down from the high plains with nothing to stop it save the neighborhoods that circled outward like a snail shell, people would fly kites in the outfield of the baseball diamond. &nbsp;He always thought it was a great idea when he saw it, but he had never done it.&nbsp; He had never gone to the store to buy a kite.&nbsp; Where would one even find a good kite that was made of something real, not cheap plastic that got twisted and torn? He wasn’t sure. &nbsp;That afternoon, there were no kites. &nbsp;The air was still, the sky cloudless. &nbsp;Tomorrow, he thought, he would buy a kite for when the wind next blew.</p>
<p>Looking out at the playing fields, Michael tried to imagine the farmland that once dominated. &nbsp;He imagined his grandfather, a retired veteran who had spent his last thirty years hunting dove in cornfields in Virginia and North Carolina, set up in a blind with his retriever darting out for a fallen bird after the crack of the shotgun blast.&nbsp; He could not imagine it.</p>
<p>Instead, he recalled a moment when he was a boy with his grandfather, laying in the back seat of his grandfather’s diesel Volkswagen Rabbit. &nbsp;The morning began with frost and Michael recalled watching his grandfather turn the key in one direction to heat the coil and then turn the key the other direction to start the engine in a guttural sigh.&nbsp; The blast of air turned to heat by the time they drove along the ocean front avenue toward the road that lead out of town.</p>
<p>“I’m tired,” Michael’s son said, a streak of mud across his cheek and a bit of snot caked around his nostrils.</p>
<p>“Do you want to go home and take a nap?” Michael asked, stooping to wipe the kids face with general movements.</p>
<p>“No nap!” the boy said and ran off, making his way toward the jungle gym until he tripped on something invisible and started crying, a few wood chips stuck to his face.</p>
<p>Michael called to his daughter.&nbsp; It was time to go.</p>
<p>In the bathroom, an hour before the dinner dance was set to begin, Michael shaved. &nbsp;He had been careless and the water from his shower had pooled on the hard tile floor.&nbsp; It was slick, but he did not have time to mop it up with a towel.&nbsp; His daughter showered in a separate bathroom and worked with his wife to comb her hair and put on her new, white dress. &nbsp;They met in the hallway, she did a self-conscious twirl and he laughed, hugged her, kissed her forehead.&nbsp; The front porch light was on, the night was warm but with a breeze that promised kite-flying weather in the morning.&nbsp; The moon was oblong and hanging high in the sky. &nbsp;He placed his arm around his daughter’s shoulder.&nbsp; They made their way down the footpath, away from home, her smile anticipating dinner and dancing and friends amid the live oaks and beneath the shimmering lights of chandeliers that held at bay the black night sky.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are stories Marvin likes to tell now that he is rich.  When you have everything, sometimes you like to remind people you once had nothing.  He believes, maybe, that this imparts a lesson of some sort, to his graduate students in particular. <em>I, too, was once a creature of hunger.</em>  You would not know it from the house he shares with Lucinda, its stunning view of the ocean, the chef’s kitchen and marble staircase.  So much open space and clean light.  It all tastes of success.  He and Lucinda keep their walls bare.  A matter of deliberate preference.  His own art is secreted away in his studio, selling for god-knows-what now, but plenty—figures that, when mentioned directly, almost embarrass him. What’s true is that he does not have to teach these occasional graduate seminars; it’s a matter of principle.</p>
<p>Near the end of each semester, he invites his grad students over for a long, wine-soaked dinner on the back terrace.  He is generous now that he can afford to be.  Lucinda, too, is a gracious host, rising on her soft, bare feet to fill everyone’s glasses with wine and replenish the plates of charcuterie and cheeses.  She is beautiful even now, while he is proud, leonine.</p>
<p>After the sun sets and everyone’s eyes have softened with red wine, he tells stories, some of his early days as an artist.  Every so often, he tells the one story.  It’s a story that Lucinda has heard many times before, a story that makes her mouth tighten, one she’d prefer he not tell.  It is a story he knows holds something within it, although what that is, he cannot discern.  For years, the wisdom within the story has remained, despite his retelling, opaque.</p>
<p>During Marvin’s final semester of art school, things were not going well.  He was nervous and bug-eyed, overeager, and his professors did not particularly like him.  He had just broken up with a girl named Melanie, and now he seemed to run into her everywhere.  Melanie was beautiful and wild.  She’d been the first in her family to go to college, on a music scholarship.  After the breakup, Marvin had heard that Melanie was no longer going to class, no longer showing up to rehearsal, using pills, vomiting up her food.  When he saw her these days, she was busking: a beautiful, bedraggled girl, rawboned and rank, playing her viola on the street.  Like a fallen character in an opera.  When Marvin saw Melanie and her viola, he’d turn the other way.  The sight shamed him.   Yet who can help falling out of love?  Or never having loved to start with? It was not his fault, of course, not entirely—but still he understood he was meant to take the blame.</p>
<p>It was time for the senior exit show, and now, without Melanie, Marvin had no guests to invite.  His parents were far away in Minnesota, practical people, disinterested in the manner in which he’d chosen to waste his education.  He had a few friends, but it seemed an act of self-indulgence to request their presence.  So he invited no one, awaiting the art show with a sense of resignation, the way one might anticipate a dental procedure.</p>
<p>That night, he wore a white button-front shirt with a blue tie his father had bought him.  He wet a comb and tried to press down his cowlick.  In the mirror, he gazed back at himself: blinking and idiotic, a farmboy parading in his father’s clothes.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the arts center, he headed straight for a small table set up with refreshments and grabbed a plastic cup of red wine.  His work was at the farthest corner of the space, a position that he understood meant he was out of favor with his professors.  Marvin’s preoccupation at the time was the human form, and so his work was filled with naked bodies: bodies strewn against other naked bodies.  Landscapes and seas of naked bodies.  Naked bodies arranged in such a way that they become almost abstracted, lines and hillocks of flesh.  He never had a shortage of volunteers.  College students, young and nubile and firm, were never shy about signing up for group nudity, particularly if he provided complimentary beer.  They posed en masse, uninhibited for Marvin, heedless of how briefly perfect they all were.</p>
<p>So Marvin stationed himself in front of his wall of naked bodies with a cup of wine.  (Now he would tell his students that, in retrospect, his work was really not bad—visually arresting, if a little naive.  These early works of his were highly coveted now, praised for their formal inventiveness.)  Parents and friends of his classmates wandered through, many of them making their way down to his end of the room for a cursory look.  Polite.  He shook hands perfunctorily with an associate dean.  A French professor praised his work sincerely.  Most of the time, however, Marvin stood there, awkward in his name tag, watching the passersby mill about, forgetful of him.</p>
<p>The show was almost over when the man in the Hawaiian shirt entered the building.  He was loud.  His booming voice and laughter cut to Marvin at the far end of the room.  He had a bushy, yellowish-white beard and wore a jaunty driver’s cap and blue shirt exploding with floral print.  He was in a wheelchair, and he moved through the room in it like it was a sedan and he was royalty.</p>
<p>“Stunning, stunning!” the man announced to no one in particular as he passed a piece by one of Marvin’s classmates.</p>
<p>Now the room was at attention.  This man, oblivious of the respectful hush everyone else seemed to honor, was moving through the room making pronouncements as if he were a visiting dignitary, some of them no more than a “Hmm” or a dismissive shake of his head.  Marvin felt himself, his classmates, all tilt toward this strange man like young stalks toward sunlight.  They yearned for it—his approval, his critique—just as they’d been trained.  Marvin wondered if the man was a critic, a collector, some sort of arbiter of taste.  Maybe a gallerist one of the professors had invited?  Collectors, gallerists—they too were allowed to be eccentrics.</p>
<p>The man in his wheelchair moved with an entourage now.  People unconsciously clustered behind him, waiting to see what pieces he found to be of interest.  The man helped himself to two quick swigs of wine and a handful of cheese sticks, proclaiming them, “Delightful!”  And then, he was approaching Marvin.</p>
<p>“My word!” the man bellowed.  He swept one thick hand forward as if to touch one of Marvin’s pieces.  Marvin blushed and stuttered, stepping to the side.  The room was quiet now, awaiting the judgment of the man in the Hawaiian shirt.</p>
<p>“Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm,”  he said, nodding to each of Marvin’s pieces individually, as if making their acquaintance.  “You, sir.  You, young man.  This is your work?”</p>
<p>Marvin’s throat was dry.  He’d gone red in the face, sweating, preemptively tasting humiliation.</p>
<p>“Yessir,”  he managed to whisper.</p>
<p>“Captivating!” the man bellowed.  “Allow me to shake your hand.  I’m a collector, see.  Always on the lookout for new talent.  And this, my god, this!”  The man threw his hands up.  He spoke in the vaguely Transatlantic way of old movie actors, and his handshake was sticky and over-firm.  Marvin wanted to wipe his hand off afterward but didn’t dare.</p>
<p>Now Marvin’s classmates were clustered around, actual envy on their faces.  Marvin could barely think.  He was accustomed to being overlooked, or, when acknowledged, treated as a mild social irritant.</p>
<p>“Here,”  the man said.  “My card.  I’d like you to see my private collection. We can discuss your work.  Friday at seven?”</p>
<p>Marvin could do nothing at that moment but nod, dumbstruck, grateful.</p>
<p>*************</p>
<p>These days, Marvin can tally all his regrets because there are so few: the time he shoved a cousin and broke his collar bone, an early painting he sold for $100 that went on to be worth millions, the woman he treated badly before he met Lucinda.  And perhaps the man in the Hawaiian shirt.  Although how could he have possibly known?  Then again, how could he <em>not</em> have known?</p>
<p>What he did know as he drove was that he was in the bad part of town.  Sad, slumping houses with No Trespassing signs, skinny dogs tied to stakes.  The college town they lived in was pleasant and medium-sized, but in its outstretches lived the real locals.  Townies.  People who often were employed by the university in some custodial capacity.  Groundskeepers, cafeteria workers, janitors.  This was where, Marvin knew, Melanie’s friends drove out to buy drugs—dumb drugs for dumb college kids—pot mostly, occasional benzos.</p>
<p>It did not, in short, look like a neighborhood where an art collector or tastemaker of any sort would live.</p>
<p>Marvin felt silly now, the collar of his shirt scratching him at the neck.  He’d dressed up, the way his mother would have expected him to dress for a church supper.   He wore imbecilic loafers.  He’d borrowed his roommate’s car and nestled his portfolio (in the sleek leather case that Melanie had bought for him before their breakup) on the seat beside him like a passenger.</p>
<p>When he pulled up to the address on the card, his sense of misgiving only deepened.  The house was small, shabby, with a weedy yard.  A full garbage bag was propped next to a rake on the front porch.  The air smelled of trash and soot, like someone had been burning things—not the good, clean smell of burning leaves but a toxic smell, gasoline and charred plastic and diapers.</p>
<p>He should have left then, but it would have seemed a waste, a failure.  He would have been embarrassed to have returned to his roommates so soon.  And there were his nagging Midwestern manners.   If one accepted an invitation, one showed up.  Besides, he still had the tiniest lingering hope that this man, despite all appearances, was somehow legitimate.</p>
<p>When he knocked on the door, he heard the man’s voice from within.</p>
<p>“Come in, come in!”</p>
<p>Marvin entered, clutching his portfolio like a shield. The house was cluttered and dark and narrow.</p>
<p>“Welcome! I’m preparing something delectable, my good fellow,” the man continued, and Marvin turned a corner, entering the kitchen.  “A delicious repast.”</p>
<p>The man was stirring something in a pot.  Marvin was surprised he could navigate the tight space in his wheelchair.  A strong odor of beef and onions rose and mingled with other smells, smells of sweat and unwashed human crevices.  Junk obstructed the hallways, old boxes and trinkets piled in odd towers.  A hoarder, Marvin thought.  He’d been invited into the home of a hoarder.</p>
<p>“Thank you for having me, Mr. Heggerty,”  Marvin said, remembering the man’s name from his card.</p>
<p>“Hans,”  the man said, ladling grim brownish stew into two bowls.  “Call me Hans, please.  Marvin.”  He handed Marvin the two bowls and gestured for him to follow.</p>
<p>Hans moved through his claustrophobic house with impressive ease.  Marvin was vaguely disoriented as he followed through the dim hall.  He led them to the back of the house and out through a glass door onto a small deck.  Being outside again was a relief.  Marvin sank gratefully into a deck chair.</p>
<p>“Bon appetit.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no, thank you. Getting over a stomach bug,”  Marvin blushed as he said it, wondering if he’d offended Hans, who merely nodded, spooning himself up a large bite.</p>
<p>They sat in silence for a few moments while Hans ate.  When he’d eaten most of his stew, he set his bowl down and leaned back in his wheelchair, stretching.</p>
<p>“Now,”  he said.  “We talk.” He tilted his head toward Marvin, and reflexively, Marvin leaned in closer, like a co-conspirator.</p>
<p>“I’m not really an art collector.  At least, not in the sense I implied.  I do collect art.  I have a real interest in it.  But unfortunately, with my financial situation, I’m not in a position to acquire more at present.”</p>
<p>He paused, stroking his beard before continuing.</p>
<p>“What I’d like to offer you is an opportunity.  I’d like to invite you to take part in an art project.  A project of the body.  My body.”</p>
<p>Hans looked at Marvin intently, and then lifted his shirt.</p>
<p>“Behold.”</p>
<p>His sagging abdomen bore raw pinkish scars like seams.  Baggies and tubes of greenish fluid and brown water seemed to extrude, as if his internal organs were leaking out.   A few strips of gauze were stuck to his chest, seeping clearish pink fluid.  There was a sweetish odor, like rot.  Later, when Marvin had grown older and dealt with the decline of both his parents, he would realize that what he was probably looking at were surgical drains and ostomy bags, but at the time, he could not comprehend what he saw.  He only knew it meant sickness, something foul.</p>
<p>“I’m dying,” Hans announced, rather cheerfully, smoothing his shirt back down over his big belly.  “I’d like to invite you to do a series of portraits of my body as I die.  A death sequence.”</p>
<p>Marvin coughed, nodding slowly.  As if to give him time to consider, Hans retrieved his bowl and spooned up another bite of stew.  The beard around his mouth was stained reddish.</p>
<p>“Wow,” Marvin said slowly.   “I don’t know how to respond.”  He was aware of how inane he sounded.  The idea was appalling.  The idea was also the sort that could make a person’s reputation.</p>
<p>“Oh, indeed.”  Hans spoke with relish.  “Imagine how much interest you’ll generate. Particularly after I’m gone.  And I’ll spare you no details—you’ll have it all, blood, shit, and viscera.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Marvin did not know what else to say.  He wished very much that he had a glass of water, something to wet his lips with, but he didn’t trust the crusted dishes he’d seen piled up in Hans’s kitchen.</p>
<p>Hans laughed now, slapping his knees like he’d just remembered the most hilarious joke.</p>
<p>“It’s the natural progression, really.  I’ve seen your work—all those kids, splayed out, naked as they day they were born.  A body dying. It’s the obvious next step.”</p>
<p>Marvin nodded.  He could smell the meaty stew on Hans’s breath.  Something churned inside him, and he felt the urge to be sick.</p>
<p>“Do you have a bathroom I could use?”</p>
<p>Hans shrugged.  There was a long moment during which he did not answer, and Marvin thought he sensed a shift, a wariness.  But when Hans responded, his voice was genteel, jolly as ever.</p>
<p>“But of course.  Down the hall to the end, on the right.”</p>
<p>Marvin likes to pause here.  It’s a good moment to refresh his drink, which he does, plunking in two ice cubes, just how he prefers.  Lucinda is semi recumbent on the chaise lounger, smiling at him wearily but patiently.  The grad students are abuzz, refilling their plates with second slices of the apricot tarte Lucinda has magicked from somewhere.  Everyone is a little bit drunk.  He grabs Lucinda’s lovely ankle, proprietary, benevolent, and presses his thumb into her instep, massaging it.</p>
<p>“I’d definitely say yes to something like that,”  one of the grad students says.  “How could you not?”</p>
<p>“You did it, didn’t you, Marvin?”  another asks.  “Surely you did it.”</p>
<p>They speak to one another as colleagues.  He insists on it, although the students are often shy at first.  But by the evening of this dinner, they have usually found their ease.</p>
<p>He shrugs, taking a sip of his drink.  All this, all that surrounds him, it is his.  He looks out to a set of distant red lights blinking from the ocean. The story isn’t finished yet.</p>
<p>Marvin slid open the glass door and stepped into the cloying darkness of the man’s house to find the bathroom.  He immediately ran into a chair, tipping it over. A woman’s brown wig landed on his feet.  He shuddered, moving gingerly through that hallway and its towers of knick-knacks and old appliances, the sag-bellied mattresses propped against the walls.  There seemed to be no windows anywhere, giving the house the cramped gloom of a cavern.  A few wobbly antique lamps cast dim circles of light here and there.</p>
<p>As his eyes adjusted, Marvin could see now that hanging all along the walls were photographs: bodies, black and brown and white, young and old, men and women.  Children.   There was something wrong with these photos.  Marvin wondered what it was that was so unsettling about the faces in them, and then he realized:  they were dead.  The photos were post-mortem.  These were cadavers, the images mortuarial.  Marvin knew this with a sinking certitude.</p>
<p>And there, at the end of the hallway stood a kind of altar.  There was no other word for it.  An old dresser was covered in little candles and photos. Marvin lifted a photo, and his breath caught.  He felt a rush of familiarity.  He picked up another photo, and another.  The photos on the dresser were posed nudes, of living people—people he knew, or at least had seen around town.  Familiar faces to anyone who went to the university: the man who begged for money outside the movie theater, the girl with her scruffy dog who was always camped out at the park, the one-armed veteran who drank endless cups of coffee at the diner.  There they were, supine or standing, naked and defiant-eyed.</p>
<p>And there was Melanie: naked, sitting cross-legged, holding her viola in her lap.</p>
<p>Marvin’s hands shook as he put the photo down.</p>
<p>He’d left the house after that, never even making it to the bathroom.  He’d left Hans all alone on his deck, wondering what became of him.  This is how the story always ends.</p>
<p>*************</p>
<p>Is there a moral to this story?  After all these years, Marvin does not know, but it is a story he still tells, over and over again.  And it’s a story to which the grad students respond with a kind of recognition.  Maybe they are thinking, <em>there are risks one must take for art,</em> or <em>watch out for people promising too much</em>, or <em>we all make difficult decisions as creators.</em> Every time, though, at least one grad student will remain undeterred.</p>
<p>Tonight, it is the quiet, skinny one with the blondish beard who says it.</p>
<p>“I would have said yes anyway.”</p>
<p>And Marvin understands that, whatever the point is, this student has missed it—all the terrible awkwardness and foreboding of the situation.  This student is not an artist but a carrion bird.  Or, maybe not a carrion bird, but a hero.</p>
<p>Marvin is no longer certain he can tell the difference.</p>
<p>Lucinda does not like to hear this story at all.</p>
<p>“I feel sorry for him,” she says afterwards, placing a pile of dishes into the sink.  “A dying man.  He couldn’t help that he was strange.  Perverted, maybe.  It’s still sad.”</p>
<p>Marvin nods.  How else can he describe the experience?  Being young and stepping into the maw of something, something inevitable, too soon.  The rot of the man’s house, its underworld quality—it has lingered with him.</p>
<p>He is famous now, but not for his figurative work.  He abandoned nudes not long after this meeting with Hans.  His work became abstract, magnificent, broad swaths of color and shape.</p>
<p>There is one detail he has never included in the story.  Neither with his students nor Lucinda.  One part he’s kept only to himself:</p>
<p>He did not immediately leave Hans’s house after encountering the weird altar and all those photos.</p>
<p>He’d realized he’d left his portfolio out on the deck.   He couldn’t leave it.</p>
<p>He’d walked back to the deck to get it.</p>
<p>And there, he saw Hans sprawled on his back like an upended tortoise.  He’d slipped out of his wheelchair, Marvin understood, reaching for something.  His drink had tipped over, and the glass lay shattered on the deck.  He was attempting to maneuver himself with one arm back into his wheelchair.</p>
<p>He was weeping.</p>
<p>It was a horrible sight.  Grotesque.  A red-faced old man, hideous in his very helplessness.  Hans shirt had fallen back once again, revealing the grayish yellow bruising on his belly, the baggie of brown fluid, the tubing flecked with blood.</p>
<p>“Help me,”  Hans muttered.  “Help.”</p>
<p>Gone were his plummy vowels, gone the accent that hinted he was landed gentry.</p>
<p>“Don’t leave me,” Hans whispered, hand outstretched.  “Please.”</p>
<p>Marvin stood there, hesitating only a moment.</p>
<p>“You’re just like me,”  Hans muttered.</p>
<p>And Marvin had grabbed his portfolio and walked away.  No.  Truthfully, he’d run.</p>
<p>For years, even as Marvin has accumulated the world that is now his, gleaming and bright and spare, he has worried about this man Hans’s words, rattling in his head like an old curse.  It is only now, as he enters his late seventies, with his new high-tech hip and the scar on his chest from the two stents, that he thinks what the man had offered him was really more of a dark riddle.</p>
<p>This is what he thinks tonight at least, the muddy moon low over the ocean outside their bay windows, waves breaking into froth on the beach below, and Lucinda sleeping, fragrant and oblivious beside him.  He will rise from his bed and pace, grateful that the walls are high and bare.</p>
<p>He does not know it yet, but tonight is the last night Lucinda will be present for one of these gatherings.  Tonight is the last time he will feel a need to tell this story.  A black thread is already tugging, but neither of them could possibly know.</p>
<p>And for now, it does not matter.  Lucinda is there, present as ever, sleeping with her long, perfect limbs askew, as elegant as if he’d posed her.  She appears so young to him still, especially at rest.  Marvin will brush a strand of hair from her forehead before stepping out to their back terrace.</p>
<p>He will stand there with a drink in his hand, breathing.</p>
<p>He is grateful for the repetition of the ocean, its waves bashing, obliterating themselves again and again, then re-forming.  Above the man-made lights, infinite stars sparkle in secret above him.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I.</strong></p>
<p>Just before going on stage, Benny released the lock on his wheelchair and tucked an orange into his jacket pocket.&nbsp; He could feel it there, its weight. He had brought it to eat at lunch, but now tried to think of a way to use it in the play, believing in some silent way that it might bring him luck. His luck had run out fifteen months ago – when the accident took away the use of his legs.&nbsp; The thought of how everything was different now made him want to yell.</p>
<p>He was chosen for the school play solely (he suspected) because of the accident.&nbsp; In fact, he believed that his teacher, Ms. Claiborne, chose this particular play because of the one character confined to a wheelchair – giving Benny,&nbsp; a senior, something to do.&nbsp; But Benny surprised them with his acting talent.&nbsp; He knew he was good, and wanted the audience to focus on his performance and, maybe, forget to pity him.</p>
<p>He called to the back of the auditorium objecting, again, to the last line of the play.&nbsp; Ms. Claiborne’s fiancé, an English professor at a nearby college, had written the play, but nobody especially liked it.&nbsp; The main character, pretentious in his wheelchair, spoke words from a Tennyson poem:&nbsp; <em>“The life that almost dies in me, That dies not, but endures the pain, And slowly forms the firmer mind.”</em> These lines made Benny cringe. He had complained and tried to change them several times.</p>
<p>“Benny, Benny.&nbsp; You have <em>got</em> to say the lines <em>as written</em>.”&nbsp; Ms. Claiborne was tall and skinny and she came forward to scold him.&nbsp; Benny’s eyes, at the level of her waist, focused on her bony elbows and childlike breasts.</p>
<p>“But I feel stupid saying them,” Benny said. “I don’t even <em>believe</em> he would say that. It sounds fake.”</p>
<p>“Nevertheless,” Ms. Claiborne said. Benny had never heard anyone actually say, &#8220;Nevertheless.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the last few rehearsals he practiced the line that Ms. Claiborne demanded, using different inflections, trying for a comfort zone; but he knew that on the night of the play he would think of something different.</p>
<p>The play would be performed three times &#8212; once on Friday night, once Saturday night, and a matinee on Sunday.&nbsp; Ms. Claiborne’s fiancé sometimes showed up for rehearsals, and when he was there, Benny said the lines as they were written; on other nights he experimented, and Ms. Claiborne fought him at every turn.</p>
<p>“No, no, no &#8211; your expressions are all wrong, Benny,” Ms. Claiborne waved her arms around expansively from the back of the auditorium.</p>
<p>“I’ll try it again,” Benny told her.&nbsp; Everyone knew Ms. Claiborne’s shortcomings, but Benny liked her anyway.&nbsp; He liked her as he liked any other teacher &#8212; not seeing them as real people – but just part of the school day.&nbsp; With the next attempt, Benny’s expression became appropriately gracious, speaking the lines softly and with precise intonation.&nbsp; Ms. Claiborne was pleased.&nbsp; He looked noble, she said.</p>
<p>Benny turned his wheelchair so that it was facing the girl at the theater’s sink.&nbsp; Her back was to him, so he looked toward the boy on the sofa.&nbsp; Even though they were all teenagers, they played characters almost thirty years old.&nbsp; One boy played an old man, a grandfather.&nbsp; Benny played a man, twenty-seven, who had not walked in eighteen years.&nbsp; The girl at the sink was the one Benny had dated last year.&nbsp; For a while, they were in love.&nbsp; The boy on the sofa was her steady now.&nbsp; Neither looked at Benny.</p>
<p>Before the accident Benny could run six miles or so with ease. Only two years ago year he had been a star on the track team, winning two trophies his sophomore year.&nbsp; He ran everywhere.&nbsp; Nothing could slow him down.&nbsp; The accident defined Benny now and he struggled not to live inside that definition. At night, sometimes, Benny heard his parents arguing about him.&nbsp; His mother insisted that Benny could do almost anything, and his father charged her with being unrealistic.</p>
<p>“Why not, Jack?&nbsp; Why can’t he become a lawyer, or anything else?” Carolyn asked.</p>
<p>“Hell, Carolyn.&nbsp; We can’t let him get his hopes too high.”</p>
<p>“He still comes to watch you in court,” Carolyn said.&nbsp; “He still wants to be a lawyer.”</p>
<p>“I just don’t want to pretend like nothing will be different.”</p>
<p>In a way Jack was right.&nbsp; Carolyn did want to pretend that Benny could do anything he could do before.&nbsp; But over the last year, as they waited to see if his legs might have a whisper of tingling, she had settled into a complacence:&nbsp; Benny could no longer run, or drive a car, or even stand in line.</p>
<p>It was Carolyn who had been driving that day.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II.</strong></p>
<p>On the day of the accident Benny’s father had waited for them at a downtown restaurant.&nbsp; He did not like to be kept waiting.&nbsp; Benny and his mother had been arguing, even before they got into the car.&nbsp; She kept saying they were going to be late.&nbsp; They argued about whose fault that was and how she would explain their lateness to his father.</p>
<p>Carolyn sped through a yellow light, but slowed at the stop sign near the restaurant.&nbsp; She came to a slow stop, but pulled out too quickly as a gray Pontiac came fast, hitting them on Benny’s side.&nbsp; Benny had seen the gray car in his peripheral vision, and he even remembered seeing his mother glance at her round-faced Timex watch.&nbsp; He remembered as if he had seen it in a movie. Then, the door metal slammed hard against him and Benny’s legs broke like two sticks.&nbsp; He still believed he <em>heard </em>them break before he passed out.&nbsp; He did not remember the jaws-of-life that extracted his body from the car; or how, when his body was lifted into the air, he looked like a streak of rags against the night sky, his legs already lifeless.&nbsp; Nor did he remember the tenor of his mother’s screams &#8212; how no one could stop her until she was sedated at the hospital.</p>
<p>The man driving the Pontiac was going fast.&nbsp; He was charged with speeding, and took the blame; but for the last year Carolyn’s face had carried a burden of guilt; her veins ran cold knowing that moment when she looked at her watch, her foot on the gas.&nbsp; She hovered day and night around Benny’s hospital bed, and would not leave him alone.</p>
<p>Benny had just turned sixteen.</p>
<p>“We’ll wait to see if he begins to feel a small tingling, then we can have some hope,” the doctor had said.&nbsp; In the beginning, doctors described Benny’s return to consciousness amazing.&nbsp; He was lucky to be alive, they said. So they hoped and waited past Thanksgiving, past Christmas.&nbsp; Then one day they pronounced Benny a paraplegic.&nbsp; Wrote it on a chart.&nbsp; A word that made the parents shiver, and Benny turned silent for months.&nbsp; His friends came by, but Benny wouldn’t talk to them.&nbsp; He closed himself off and &nbsp;ate meals in his room, watching reruns.&nbsp; His mother urged him to come out, and Benny yelled for her to “Leave me alone.”&nbsp; His father helped him dress in the morning and at bedtime, helped him with his bath; but Benny resented the presence of his father and barely spoke as they went through these daily routines.&nbsp; Benny did keep up with his studies though; so that when he went back to school he would graduate with his class.</p>
<p>After returning to school in February, his friends, most of them, continued to include him in clubs or after-school activities. Some felt uncomfortable and avoided him, but his best friend, Charlie, drove to his house with the radio blaring to take Benny to school and to parties, throwing the wheelchair into the trunk, as if this were no trouble at all.&nbsp; He brought cans of cold beer, so they could drink the way they used to do.</p>
<p>For the last two weeks Benny had asked Charlie to drive him to the courthouse after school, because he wanted to watch a trial that had been in the news.&nbsp; The courthouse was packed, and on some days an angry mob gathered outside; but each afternoon Benny rolled his chair into the back of the courtroom and watched his father, a prominent judge in town, try a case that involved a brutal murder.</p>
<p>The newspapers had been full of reports about the arrest of Gerald Early.&nbsp; Mr. Early had strangled a five-year-old girl in her backyard.&nbsp; He admitted everything:&nbsp; he had climbed over a fence, talking to the girl while she played in the sandbox.&nbsp; Just moments before he climbed over, Lily had been on her swing, singing a song she had learned in school.&nbsp; She was friendly and unafraid, and when he asked her to sing it for him again, she performed her song swinging up in a small arc.&nbsp; She had seen this man before in the grocery store and felt that he was someone she knew.&nbsp; She recognized his face.</p>
<p>Lily was found behind a tree with her neck broken, lying at an odd angle, like a doll thrown out into the yard.&nbsp; Even before the trial, the town talked about giving Gerald Early the death penalty; and, though the defense tried to get a change of venue, it was denied.</p>
<p>“I’m glad this case is almost over,” the Judge said one night at dinner.&nbsp; “This town has been torn apart by what’s happened here.”</p>
<p>“We think it can never happen in our own community,” said his wife.&nbsp; Carolyn, though lovely, had a hard-edged face.&nbsp; She was from Arizona, a Senator’s daughter, and grew up under the attentive eye of the press and a father’s idealism.&nbsp; “But, Jack, we won’t ever know what kind of life made him become that way.”</p>
<p>“I don’t care,” the Judge argued.&nbsp; “Some things cannot be excused.”</p>
<p>Carolyn knew the things that could not be excused.&nbsp; She wore a mask of cheerfulness, but lived in the guilt of what she might have prevented &#8212; if not for her distractedness, her hurrying.</p>
<p>Benny still closed himself in his room, but when he got the star role in the school play, he asked his mother to help him with his lines.&nbsp; She recited the parts of others and watched Benny say the lines like a real actor.</p>
<p>“Where did you learn to act like that?” she asked him.&nbsp; Today was his mother’s birthday.&nbsp; She was forty-five, and Benny had given her a scarf.</p>
<p>“This wheelchair taught me,” Benny said.&nbsp;&nbsp; He wondered what it would feel like to be forty-five, still in a wheelchair.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; III.</strong></p>
<p>Gerald Early was forty-five.&nbsp; At first, he denied killing the little girl, but when they put him on the stand, when the district attorney grilled him, he broke down and, in a quiet voice, confessed; but he said he couldn’t remember the actual moment of killing Lily.&nbsp; Mr. Early had suffered from mental illness as a young man, and had a record of two mildly violent episodes.&nbsp; He was hospitalized for four years then released into the care of his sister.&nbsp; He took medication, which his sister monitored, and for eight years he had held a job shelving items at the local grocery store.&nbsp; People liked him, and never expected such a horrific act.&nbsp; He had never seriously hurt anyone, until now.</p>
<p>Mr. Early cried on the stand.&nbsp; He admitted that he had done a terrible, terrible thing.&nbsp; He said he was sorry, but no one wanted to believe he was sorry.&nbsp; No one wanted to forgive him. Gerald Early did not seem to care what the jury did to him, and told the judge it didn’t matter if he lived or died.</p>
<p>Benny had been present for much of the trial.&nbsp; He had heard the closing arguments and when the verdict was announced by the jury that Gerald Early was found guilty, Benny heard his father say the words.&nbsp; The jury recommended the death sentence.</p>
<p>As Benny waited for his father to leave the courthouse, the Judge lifted his son from the chair into the front seat of his car.&nbsp; He put the wheelchair into the trunk.&nbsp; “You cold?” he asked.&nbsp; Benny had his hands in his pockets.</p>
<p>“Do you believe he deserves the death penalty?” Benny asked.</p>
<p>“He’ll probably end up in a mental hospital,” his father said.&nbsp; “Either way it’s a life sentence.” Rain fell in big drops and spattered across the windshield.&nbsp; The drops came so fast that Benny jumped, as though he had heard a loud sound.</p>
<p>“Should I take you home or back to school?&nbsp; Do you have rehearsal tonight?”</p>
<p>Benny looked at his watch.&nbsp; “School,” Benny said.&nbsp; “We have to be there by six o’clock.”</p>
<p>“What about supper?”</p>
<p>“The man who wrote the play is bringing pizza for everybody.”</p>
<p>The Judge leaned forward over the steering wheel and looked up at the sky.&nbsp; “I hope it won’t rain like this on your opening night.”</p>
<p>“Well,” Benny said.&nbsp; “All the parents will be there anyway.”</p>
<p>The Judge smiled at his son. “Your mother says you want to change the ending of the play.”</p>
<p>Benny nodded.&nbsp; “Yeah,” he said. “The man who wrote the play used lines from Tennyson’s “In Memoriam,” but I’ve found some better lines from that same poem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Much better.&nbsp; And another thing,” he said.&nbsp; “I’m going to do something to change the ending.”</p>
<p>“Change it? How?”</p>
<p>“So people don’t feel so sorry for me at the end.”&nbsp; He blew breath through his nose to show disgust.&nbsp; “I’m going to make that different.”</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IV.</strong></p>
<p>Gerald Early had stood when the jury sentenced him to death, but he had faltered, sitting down, while the policemen approached to take him away.&nbsp; His life was finished.&nbsp; He turned to look at his sister, his eyes like stones.</p>
<p>But in that moment just before the two policemen approached the prisoner, Benny saw Gerald Early’s sister &#8212; a young woman, same hair and eyes as Gerald, same shape of face and placement of brows – lean in and hand something to her brother.&nbsp; Benny, at first, thought she might be handing him a knife, or a gun, but he saw, immediately, that she had given Gerald an orange, a whole orange. At first, no one else seemed to notice, so Benny thought maybe he had imagined it.</p>
<p>The sister had come to the trial every day.&nbsp; Anyone could see that she loved Gerald, never seeing him as a monster, but sitting, each day, as close as she could&nbsp; to the defendant’s table.&nbsp; On the day when her brother was found guilty, she offered him this gift as if it were something she could not bear for him <em>not</em> to have.&nbsp; They could have been anywhere.&nbsp; This simple offering seemed to resist the sharp truth of what had been handed down, of what Gerald had done.</p>
<p>As Gerald took the orange he seemed like a regular person, and Benny recognized something strong in this sister &#8212;&nbsp; a woman who knew the meaning of a gift that offered, if not forgiveness, at least a love that went too far back to forget.</p>
<p>When one of the policemen saw the sister lean in, he knocked Early’s hand down hard and the orange rolled under a chair.&nbsp; The sister began to cry.&nbsp; As another policeman lifted the orange, he inspected it and handed &nbsp;it to the young woman.&nbsp; She reached forward to offer it again to Gerald.</p>
<p>The policeman had not yet cuffed Gerald, but turned to the Judge who was watching them.&nbsp; The Judge nodded; so the policeman said, “Take it.&nbsp; Hell, just take it.”</p>
<p>Gerald took the orange and held it like a cherished, hopeful thing.&nbsp; He rolled it around with such gentleness that Benny imagined it shimmering, like light in the palm of his hand.&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>After that day in court, Benny dreamed of oranges &#8212; acres of them &#8212; some in bowls or barrels, boatloads of them on the river.&nbsp; Once he dreamed of an orange stuck on the ends of his own fingers &#8212; even becoming his fingers and toes.&nbsp; He, too, wanted to feel like a regular person.&nbsp; He asked his mother to pack an orange every day in his lunch; but for the first few days he could not peel it, could not bring himself to break the bright skin.&nbsp; He rolled the orange in his hand.&nbsp; He wanted to see it glow again, to glisten with fresh life.</p>
<p>Finally he just put the oranges in his locker, until after a week they began to rot, turn black, sink in on themselves.&nbsp; He kept thinking they might come back whole.&nbsp; One morning he opened his locker and they were gone.&nbsp; Someone had cleaned them out.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; V.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>On the play’s opening night, it rained.&nbsp; His father drove him to the school auditorium.&nbsp; Thunder and lightning split the heavens and rain poured down in sheets. When they reached the auditorium, the Judge grabbed his umbrella from the back seat.&nbsp; He took the wheelchair out of the trunk and lifted his son into it.&nbsp; Rain soaked their clothes, and water ran down the Judge’s face.&nbsp; “Take the umbrella,” he said, as he pushed the chair into the school &#8212; his head above the umbrella’s fabric.</p>
<p>“You’ll need it,” Benny said.&nbsp; He could not see his father’s face or his shoulders hunched under the downpour; he could see only the bottom of his raincoat flapping beside the wheel of the chair. But when his father turned to leave, when he got into the car, Benny saw him sit for a long moment before starting the ignition, saw him lean against the steering wheel, his head pushed forward, as though he were already speeding away.</p>
<p>Benny put the umbrella across his legs, as water dripped puddles onto the floor.&nbsp; He was always aware, now, of his lack of height in the world.&nbsp; He used to be tall and speak to others face to face; now he was always looking up or seeing others lean down toward him.&nbsp; Now he was aware of belt buckles and shirt-tails, and in the school hallway he felt surrounded by trees walking.&nbsp; He could never rise up.</p>
<p>Tonight, Benny had five oranges tucked into the side pouches of his wheelchair.</p>
<p>Ms. Claiborne scurried around backstage trying to put costumes in order. She urged people to get dressed, and issued last minute warnings, citing mistakes that she had noticed in dress rehearsal the night before.&nbsp; When she saw Benny dripping wet in the wheelchair she yelled.&nbsp; “Get a towel, someone. Quick.&nbsp; Help me get Benny ready.&nbsp; His jacket is wet.&nbsp; Find another one for him.”</p>
<p>“This one’s fine,” Benny said.</p>
<p>Ms. Claiborne leaned down close to Benny’s face.&nbsp; Too close.&nbsp; Her breath smelled stale and garlicky, and he tried not to show distaste. “Are you okay?” she asked.&nbsp; “Are you ready for this?”</p>
<p>“I will be, if you can take this umbrella.” He handed her his father’s umbrella, and in that moment thought of handing over everything: the night’s performance, the play, the accident, all five oranges stuffed into side pockets of his wheelchair – everything.</p>
<p>Ms. Claiborne took the umbrella, not recognizing that something was being offered.&nbsp; She threw it to one side of the stage.&nbsp; Benny pressed his hands around the oranges stuffed in the side pockets.&nbsp; He found a small sack backstage and put the oranges into it.&nbsp; He would offer them to someone on stage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VI.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>During the play the audience grew very quiet, a sign that they were listening, maybe enthralled.&nbsp; No one even coughed. By the second act, the applause was loud, and most of the talk was about Benny’s performance.&nbsp; He was marvelous.&nbsp; People were amazed &#8212; especially the Judge.</p>
<p>At the end of the play Benny’s character entered the stage from the side, the wheelchair coming from a place that was, supposedly, the porch.&nbsp; He held the sack on his lap.&nbsp; Four people on stage were engaged in bantering conversation, saying their lines perfectly; but when Benny entered, a little before cue, they stopped.&nbsp; Someone said the line that called his character’s name and Benny said:&nbsp; “<em>He is not here; but far away.”</em></p>
<p>Then he handed the sack out towards one girl who reached to take it. <em>“I know that this is life,”</em> he said.&nbsp; Everyone looked puzzled, then the sack broke and oranges rolled onto the stage floor and under Benny’s wheelchair.&nbsp; The audience laughed, nervously.</p>
<p>One person bent to pick up an orange &#8212; not knowing what might come next.&nbsp; Then another one kneeled to reach under the wheelchair.&nbsp; Soon they were all kneeling around the metal wheels of his chair, reaching beneath it for an orange.</p>
<p>And for a moment they appeared to be bowing to Benny, so that Benny’s head rose up higher than the others.&nbsp; The actors, still on the floor, held up their oranges, mystified about what had happened. They were smiling, but didn’t know why.&nbsp; And the unpredictable turn that had broken through came down on the audience &#8212; like a large floodlight shining down, or the whole moon appearing, suddenly, from behind a cloud.&nbsp; Nobody knew what they were supposed to feel.</p>
<p>At that same moment, Benny raised his arms, becoming even taller, as if he were about to stand up.&nbsp; He had a look of both surprise and great ceremony and he quoted randomly from lines of the Tennyson poem &#8211; making it present tense<em>:&nbsp; The noise of life begins.</em> <em>Each morning wakes the will and cries.&nbsp; </em>He spoke loudly, and the audience saw a shift in Benny’s face &#8212; a look that would not be eclipsed.&nbsp; They smiled. “<em>Don’t be the fool of loss.” </em>he said. They clapped.&nbsp; The applause grew louder, and Benny would have struggled to find words for feelings so unexpected.</p>
<p>And the audience, caught up in the moment, saw their own lives in a fresh light:&nbsp; the way someone leaves a theatre and believes again, for a while, in the possibility of change.&nbsp; By then, not even Ms. Claiborne wanted to quibble about the correctness of the ending.</p>
<p>Benny received three curtain calls, and the next two performances were sold out.&nbsp; But the last moment of the play was never as good as it was on that first night.&nbsp; The ending had not been part of the play, but the play had been made by that moment.&nbsp; Afterwards, the Judge and his wife beamed, preening before their friends in the lobby of the school’s auditorium.</p>
<p>They took Benny home, saying they would come again on Saturday night and on Sunday afternoon.&nbsp; They were full of praise as they lifted him into bed and helped him remove his clothes.&nbsp; Benny didn’t want his mother to be in the room when he was undressing, so she told him goodnight and left while his father helped pull off his pants.</p>
<p>“Did you really think I was good?” Benny unbuttoned his shirt and reached for his pajamas.</p>
<p>“You were.&nbsp; You were extremely good,” the Judge said.</p>
<p>“You know where I got the idea for the oranges, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“From Gerald Early.”&nbsp; His father laughed &#8212; a real laugh, but he didn’t understand.&nbsp; “I just want to say,” he said.&nbsp; “I want to tell you how proud we were. The whole town saw you tonight and well, I mean, you were a star.”&nbsp; He leaned over the bed to pull up the covers.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to help me,” Benny said.&nbsp; “I can do it.” He pushed up and scooted to the middle of the bed, dragging his legs and pulling the covers up to his chest. He felt grateful for the strength in his arms. The Judge turned out the light.</p>
<p>Benny’s mother was already undressed and she called goodnight to him.&nbsp; She swirled around and the hem of her gown made a circle at her feet. “He was good,” she said.&nbsp; But, even in this moment, blame hung like a wrap on her shoulders. She laid her robe at the foot of the bed.</p>
<p>“Yes.&nbsp; I thought people would never stop clapping.”&nbsp; The Judge could not stop smiling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VII.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>In his room Benny lay awake, his pride swelling, his whole heart an orange.&nbsp; He touched his heart and imagined it sectioned, unbroken.&nbsp; He imagined it beating, and he believed that what he had thought was gone was not gone completely.&nbsp; He anticipated the next evening when he would be on stage again.</p>
<p>After two hours, Carolyn lifted herself from her bed and went to Benny’s room, her feet slippered in bedroom shoes.&nbsp; She touched his head gently, pushing her fingers through his hair. Benny knew she was there and he knew why.&nbsp; He could hear her sobbing; a shadow, shapeless, beside him.&nbsp; She sat on the edge of his bed, and he could barely feel her weight on the mattress.&nbsp; He smelled the moist, warm odor of her body. The window was open, and a slight wind blew the hem of her robe, moving like it was water.</p>
<p>He was not surprised that his mother was there.&nbsp; She said nothing, but sat as Benny slept.&nbsp; Each time he woke, she was still there in the dark room, like a small soul perched on the rim of the world. Finally, just as day began to break, Benny, without turning to face her, said, “Nobody blames you, you know.” His voice filled the room. “It wasn’t your fault.”</p>
<p>His mother shivered, as if an electric current had gone through her body. A small sound escaped her throat, not a sigh but a tiny cry, a mewing.&nbsp; She touched his back, keeping her hand there and sitting a while longer until, just before the sun rose, he felt her weight leave the bed.</p>
<p>Benny sat up, propped himself against the headboard, and faced the window.&nbsp; Though his life was the same, he felt different now<em>.&nbsp; </em>Being in the play had brought girls back into his life.&nbsp; They stopped to talk to him, feeling comfortable, laughing at something he said.&nbsp; One night after play practice, the brunette who worked with scenery, kissed his cheek and whispered his name.</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>He watched the sun ease itself up over the line of horizon and felt the delight of a long wide yawn. Most mornings he watched the day begin with a bruise of color; but today he felt warmth from the sweep of sunlight, flying over his desk like a bright bird.&nbsp; Then, at the sound of the clock’s&nbsp; ticking, Benny turned his body to push his feet onto the floor.&nbsp; He reached for his pants and t-shirt, which he was able to put on after several tries.&nbsp; He did not stop and rest, but persisted until his muscular arms pulled his body into the wheelchair.&nbsp; There he sat, saturated with dreams that felt limitless, and a reality that felt final.&nbsp; He lingered, a moment longer, in the pale juice of morning and tried to think of some new line to shout to the outside world.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hired specifically to teach “Paper, Clay, Wood, and Cloth,” a class in basic craft skills, to eight- and nine-year-olds, I was 16 when I worked as a counselor/teacher at the Rock Point summer camp.&nbsp; Even though I didn’t like having to ask my campers to call me Miss Wilson, it was the best job I’ve ever had,</p>
<p>My mother had put me up for it without consulting me first, probably because she knew I would ask her not to do it.&nbsp; She did so because she knew I had a passion for making things&#8211;crafts, as we call it&#8211;but also because when she was my age she had taught a similar class at Rock Point.</p>
<p>Her secret agenda, however, was that my anti-social inclinations had begun to concern her, and she thought the job would require me to engage with other people.&nbsp; Had she explained her reasoning to me, I would have said something along the lines of, “Mother, are you sure children that age qualify as people?”</p>
<p>Of course her answer would have been, “Claire, when you were that age, were you a person?”&nbsp; From when I was about seven, my mother and I had been locked into what we jokingly called “our affectionate struggle.”</p>
<p>Being obnoxious was not my only defense against her, but it was a pretty good one.&nbsp; My mother was smart, articulate, and patient, and her love for me was a potent weapon; however, she had an emotional allergy to me when my mood turned spikey.</p>
<p>I was only briefly obnoxious about the job&#8211;and I couldn’t help being pleased when the summer camp staff invited me to join them&#8211;because I already knew Rock Point to be an uncommonly good place.&nbsp; Good in the sense that it was situated on about a mile or so of the Lake Champlain shore, that it had many woodland paths, and that it seemed to me to be infused with that loosey-goosey Episcopalian free-style take-me-as-I-am spirituality.</p>
<p>Also throughout my childhood the place had never failed to improve my mood when my mother took me to Rock Point, which was whenever she felt restless and in need of what she called “a change of scenery.”&nbsp; For my whole life my mother has flirted with becoming a priest&#8211;though I doubt there’s any cause and effect between my birth and her religious yearning.</p>
<p>When I signed the contract for the two-month position, I suddenly understood that it was a bigger deal than I’d thought it would be.&nbsp; I’d never been employed before, never even imagined being paid for my ability and my time, and certainly never signed a document that listed duties I had to carry out whether I felt like it or not.</p>
<p>If I felt a little trapped, I also felt peculiarly grown-up.&nbsp; My parents seemed to notice a change in me and to treat me as if I’d suddenly become a more responsible person, and I was mildly thrilled that they were giving me more respect.</p>
<p>My classroom was barn-like, large enough for two or three times as many children as I’d be teaching, with a high ceiling and one wall with a table-like shelf and a row of permanently sealed windows along the length of it.&nbsp; Always cool in the mornings, that workspace became warm enough on sunny days to make the campers and me sweaty by mid-afternoon.</p>
<p>The room had a baked cedary smell that suggested it was where work of some kind&#8211;maybe carpentry or furniture-making?&#8211;had been accomplished in the past.&nbsp; It held six rectangular tables that I arranged in a square with a dozen chairs around it, though I rarely had more than ten children in my classes.</p>
<p>Bobby Wilson, Hershel LeTourneau, Hazel Hicks, Rachel Telford, Pete Copenhaver, Penny Hale, Elly Clay, and Katie Randall were my morning class, and those children have remained vivid in my thoughts for all this time.&nbsp; When their parents brought them into that huge room to meet me, they seemed so small and shy and dear that I was instantly smitten with them.</p>
<p>Each child came to me, with its parents herding him or her in my direction, and I shook their hands formally, as our camp director had suggested I should.&nbsp; I was pretty sure that most of them had never suffered through the ritual of shaking an adult’s hand.</p>
<p>During that first meeting with my campers, I was jolted by the realization that I suddenly considered myself to be an adult.&nbsp; To be specific, it was Pete Copenhaver’s small, sweaty hand in mine (after his father whispered to him that he should extend his hand toward me) and his reluctance to look me straight in the face that made me imagine myself through his eyes.</p>
<p>I wasn’t so happy with that news.&nbsp; For a little while that morning I would have been okay with changing places with any one of my campers.</p>
<p>The one to whom I’d have chosen to hand over my responsibility was Hazel Hicks, whose somber face and bold eyes meeting mine&#8211;dark brown eyes that continued to scrutinize me for some moments&#8211;gave me to understand that she would be either the hellion or the angel of that group.&nbsp; When I told her that I was glad she was going to be in my class, she blushed and said, “I’m glad, too.”</p>
<p>She could have been quite a formidable hellion if she’d chosen that path, but before she even attended our first session Hazel was on board with “Paper, Clay, Wood, and Cloth”.&nbsp; She was a child who, for whatever reasons, had grown impatient with childhood and who I think was desperate for activities that would challenge and engage her.</p>
<p>It is as hard now as it was then for me to distinguish between what Hazel told me about herself&#8211;which wasn’t a lot, really, she wasn’t chatty&#8211;and what I surmised about her from watching how she behaved.&nbsp; I sometimes felt guilty because my attention was constantly drawn toward Hazel who (without awareness or effort) was an intense presence among the other kids.</p>
<p>What she had, at a ridiculously high level, was focus, and that resource wasn’t necessarily to her advantage.&nbsp; She had poor social skills, didn’t make friends, seemed to have no athletic ability, paid little attention to her appearance, and could barely tolerate her classmates’ childish ways.</p>
<p>I mostly had to give up on assigning her to work with any of the other campers on our projects.&nbsp; To give her credit, she did not try to alienate her co-campers&#8211;mostly she just ignored them&#8211;and if they became angry with her, she didn’t quarrel with them, she just walked away, but she always seemed a little surprised that she’d upset any of them.</p>
<p>For me observing her was a pleasure because in many ways she was absolutely transparent.&nbsp; I was moved by the way she was attracted almost physically to most of the materials we used for our projects&#8211;she loved handling the pieces of cedar and pine we used for making small boxes; the bits of cloth we used for making placemats and doll quilts amused her; she liked arranging mosaics out of the beads we used for making necklaces and bracelets; she even made exotic weavings with the stupid strings of colored plastic we used for making lanyards.</p>
<p>Mostly because of Hazel&#8211;and because Rock Point had a pond and two small but lively creeks&#8211;I introduced a unit on ponds and streams so that we could see and talk about turtles, tadpoles, frogs, salamanders, and birds.&nbsp; To watch that girl lying flat out on the wet grass, conversing earnestly with a turtle, was to understand something profound about both childhood and the world we lose when we become adults.</p>
<p>Those eight students of my morning session became my beloved ones, though I believe that the afternoon class was just as lively and funny and that my success-to-failure rate as a teacher was pretty much the same with both groups.&nbsp; I believe it was because the morning students came to me not exactly straight from bed but when the day was still fresh for them and when their dream-life still lingered in their minds.</p>
<p>There was also a slowly-evolving change that I witnessed with the morning kids&#8211;of the group slowly coalescing around Hazel and Hazel unconsciously accepting their almost unwilling approval.&nbsp; Initially an outcast, that lonely girl&#8211;before my eyes&#8211;became a peculiar version of a leader.</p>
<p>I have to be quick to say that I doubt that Hazel thought of herself as lonely or an outcast or a leader of any kind.&nbsp; As I’ve said, her first quality as a person was that she possessed focus, though I now realize a therapist might have diagnosed her as unbalanced, a child who needed coaching in social behavior.</p>
<p>If in the first week of our session another child saw Hazel standing still as a stone to watch a blacksnake shed its skin, that child very likely would have laughed at her and summoned other kids to come and look at the weirdo.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the next-to-last week, that same child would have slipped quietly up beside Hazel and watched the blacksnake with her.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s likely I noticed that evolution because Hazel was my favorite&#8211;there’s no denying that&#8211;and I feel neither shame nor guilt for having observed her more carefully than I did the others.&nbsp; I didn’t treat her as a favorite, and if I had, Hazel would very likely have lost respect for me.</p>
<p>My point is that she was a constant, and her eight classmates were the ones who changed their attitudes toward her.&nbsp; That dynamic, of the community moving toward harmony, was immensely rewarding for me as both participant and witness.</p>
<p>In the fourth week of the session, in the second week of July, by eleven o’clock, the day had become so hot that I opened the classroom door in hopes that a breeze from across the meadow would cool our room down enough that our last hour of the session wouldn’t be so sweaty and miserable.&nbsp; I had barely turned back to the children and the table where we were making origami owls, frogs, and flowers, when two small black forms flew into the room.</p>
<p>Because they were about the size of badminton shuttlecocks, at first I thought they were bats, but almost immediately I saw that they were not darting erratically as bats do but were swooping in arcs over our heads.&nbsp; Only a second or two later I realized they were barn swallows&#8211;of the sort that every evening flew over the meadow catching mosquitos and other insects.</p>
<p>The children were shrieking and covering their heads, and Hershel LeTourneau, the biggest boy in the class, had even scooted down out of his chair and seemed to be cowering under the table.&nbsp; I felt the panic of the children but maybe because I was the teacher and the grown-up in the room, I sat still and in that stillness sensed a wave of serenity come over me.</p>
<p>The other person in the room who sat still and remained in her chair, her head lifted to watch the swallows above our heads, was of course Hazel, and when her eyes met mine I felt&#8211;I know this is strange!&#8211;so joyful the girl might have been an angel smiling me at me.&nbsp; I’m certain these were not the words that she meant to convey to me&#8211;and probably she was thinking nothing she wanted to share with me, but what I thought in that moment as the way Hazel and I were perceiving those birds was <em>like they’re little souls frantic to find the bodies from which they’ve fallen.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>I know that I must have smiled for just that moment, but in Hazel’s face I saw&#8211;or imagined I saw&#8211;her understanding that the swallows were much more terrified than her classmates.&nbsp; They flew toward the windows and scrabbled against the glass, then flew back up into the ceiling space, but in a few seconds they swept down and again and fluttered horizontally along the shelf below the glass, wild in their entrapment.</p>
<p>Almost at the same moment Hazel and I stood up and turned toward the windows and the birds.&nbsp; I wasn’t especially surprised that Hazel and I acted so similarly, as if we’d discussed a plan and had risen together&#8211;though truth be told, I had no notion of what I was going to do beyond moving toward the small black birds.</p>
<p>Swallows swooping in graceful arcs over a meadow or zooming a foot above the grass at twilight are mesmerizing to watch, but they are not likeable creatures&#8211;they build nests underneath the eaves of porches; they splatter their poop on porch-floors and railings; and when their babies hatch, they dive-bomb anyone who comes close to their nests.&nbsp; Their sharp beaks and wing-tips, and their forked tail-feathers make them look like tiny fighter jets, which is how they behave when they’re riled up.</p>
<p>As a grown-up who often returns to Rock Point for spiritual sustenance, I’ve come to know swallows very well, but at the time those two swept into my classroom, pity for them welled up in me&#8211;and probably in my nine-year-old student Hazel as well.&nbsp; Though I believe that I’m a good person and generally an honest and compassionate one, I’m not someone who’s ever acted with notable courage or intelligence, and so I’m proud of what Hazel and I managed to do that morning.</p>
<p>That there were the two of us makes all the difference&#8211;and really at nine and sixteen years old, I could claim that we were both children.&nbsp; Nowadays I believe everything in that classroom&#8211;the birds, the bright day, the shrieking children, the desks, the windows, the vault of space overhead, even the baked-wood fragrance of the room&#8211;enchanted Hazel and me so that we were ageless in those moments.</p>
<p>She on one side of the window wall, I on the other, each of us managed with our hands to guide a single bird down into the corner between the glass wall and the shelf that served as a ledge.&nbsp; “Just be really gentle,” I murmured, more to myself than to Hazel, “and you can cup them between your two hands.”</p>
<p>She caught hers a few moments before I caught mine.&nbsp; Once we had their wings pinned against their sides, they submitted calmly, with their swiveling heads extending out of the space between our forefingers and thumbs.</p>
<p>When we looked at each other, I smiled because that is how I am, and Hazel merely directly looked at me because that was how she was, but the intensity of her look informed me that her heart was thrumming away in her chest the same as mine was in mine.&nbsp; We both turned to carry the birds to show the children, and as we circled in opposite directions around the tables, they ooohed and aaahed appreciatively and wanted to put their faces right up to within an inch of the birds’ beaks and eyes.</p>
<p>Those minutes of showing my campers the swallow in my cupped hands&#8211;and I swear I could feel the high-pitched rattle of its heart&#8211;foretold my future.&nbsp; I would teach children about the age of these campers, and I would try to find opportunities for them to witness the extraordinary events that sometimes happen in ordinary settings.</p>
<p>I walked outside with Hazel close behind me.&nbsp; We walked a little way out into the meadow, which was shockingly green underneath the plain blue sky.</p>
<p>Then we turned to each other.&nbsp; “On three,” I murmured, and she nodded.</p>
<p>I sounded the <em>one</em> and the <em>two</em> very softly, but I shouted the <em>three</em>, and we flung our hands and the birds upward.&nbsp; They knew what to do and zoomed up and out away from us, and we knew what to do, too, though I’m certain neither of us had done it before.</p>
<p>We danced a quick-spinning little jig out there on the grass and then stopped and laughed.&nbsp; If on my deathbed I’m granted the memory of a single human face, I’ll ask that it be Hazel’s, flushed and breathless, just before she and I turned to go back to our classroom.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I cheated on my husband to prove something to my sister. When Paul’s mouth first leaned toward mine, his lips in that teasing smile that just about killed me, so different from my husband’s, I wasn’t thinking, <em>Oh shit, this man is about to kiss me. </em>I was thinking, <em>Are you watching me, Jessica? Are you fucking watching me this time?</em></p>
<p>The second time we slept together, I wasn’t thinking about Jessica at all. I was wondering how much Paul desired me. If I’d be enough to hold his interest. I was arching my back and leaning forward, leaning in.</p>
<p>The third time, and all the times after that, I thought only of myself. About taking what I wanted, what I needed, whenever I wanted or needed it. Just throwing myself into the furnace of this burning world.</p>
<p>Affairs are cancerous, it turns out. If you drop a splash of black paint into a glass of water it’ll hover there at first, suspended for a moment. Just a stain, surrounded by all that clarity. But give it some time. The whole glass will turn black.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Jessica is two years younger than me, but she was always brighter, wilder. For two blissful years, I moved through the hallways of my high school in peace and quiet. She was still in middle school down the block, stuck in that plaid uniform skirt and itchy red knee socks I’d left behind. But then my junior year began, and Jessica was there, everywhere, all that sparkle and verve of her filling my crowded hallways.</p>
<p>She sauntered up to me on her first day before the morning bell.</p>
<p>“So this is you, huh?” she said, gesturing toward my locker. I stepped aside automatically. She rummaged through my notebooks and hardcovers, poked at my graphing calculator. She stepped back and put her hands on her hips, appraising.</p>
<p>“God, Taylor. You’re so freaking boring.” She sighed, dug into her backpack and pulled out a bag of Skittles. One eyebrow raised, she shook them in my face like a rattle. She tossed the bag into my locker with an arch smile. “A little color couldn’t hurt.”</p>
<p>She leaned up and kissed my cheek. Then she walked down the hallway, all the sass in the world in her step. She’s got this corn silk blond hair, these big blue anime eyes. She’s tiny, but fierce, like you don’t know whether she’s about to seduce or punch you, and the truth is you like the confusion. As she walked away in her torn-up jeans and black tank top, a little biker babe, her skin glowed a pale perfect white. The boys at their lockers—all upperclassmen in that wing, my wing—followed her slow walk with their eyes. I sighed, shoved the Skittles under my gym clothes, and slammed my locker shut.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>I’m 32 now, and I look pretty good. I’m old enough to have some confidence, finally, but still young enough to pull it together. I started running a few years ago. I was trying to take better care of my body and surprised myself by getting addicted. The running cleans out my heart somehow, invigorating and calming me at the same time. My body changed, growing lean and strong, and that became its own addiction. These days I get ready for work with an eye for what’ll draw attention to my small waist, or make the most of my still-decent breasts. I hunt my dark hair for grays, pulling strands out with tweezers, then put on black eyeliner and red lipstick—a little bold for the office, but that’s okay. I didn’t hit my stride until 30, when the awkwardness of my youth slid away. I’m afraid my newfound looks will leak away the moment I turn 40 and I’m not really young anymore. Not young enough to matter, anyway. It feels like a cruel joke that I should finally grow beautiful at the same moment I begin to grow old.</p>
<p>“Who’s all that for?” Chris asked a few months ago, before things went south between us. I wasn’t dressed yet. I was smoothing moisturizer on my face and neck. You have to remember your neck, or it’ll give you away.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>He was in his boxers on his side of the bed. He gestured to my body with a sweeping motion. With the other hand he scratched the dog’s ear. Turnip’s our gray mutt. She’s got fur that stands up in a jaunty Mohawk all the time. Chris is always trying to smooth it down, to organize her, but I like it better standing up.</p>
<p>“Pretty panties for the office,” he said. “Trying to impress someone?” He used his jokester voice. Like this was a normal question for a husband to ask his wife. He’d been sending barbed jokes my way lately, tiny comments that should have been compliments but felt like baited traps.</p>
<p>My bra and underwear matched. It wasn’t a set—I don’t own sets of underwear, or lingerie, or sexy dresses. All that takes effort, and I usually don’t bother. But that morning I was wearing a black bra and a black lace thong I’d dug up from the back of my drawer because I hadn’t done laundry. Black on black. Organized. Accidentally sexy.</p>
<p>“It’s all for you, baby,” I said dryly. “Or you know, my office boyfriend. That hot affair I’m having.”</p>
<p>“Oh, but that ass is mine,” he said, laughing. He wrapped one arm around my waist and pulled me in, without bothering to notice if I wanted to be held. He lifted my hair, still damp from the shower, and kissed the back of my neck. I stared in the mirror and waited him out. Then I pushed away and picked up my hairbrush.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>I met Chris at the Metuchen High homecoming dance when I was 14. I wore red platforms that made me feel too tall, and a purple t-shirt that was too tight. Jessica had dressed me. She clapped her hands like a delighted toddler at the sight of me showing my cleavage instead of hiding it. When I tried to change back she shoved me out the door.</p>
<p>“Maybe you’ll finally get lucky,” she yelled down the driveway. She was twelve.</p>
<p>I was positive I was the only girl in school who hadn’t been kissed yet. I stood in the corner of the vaulted gymnasium, friendless and sweaty, worrying over my shoes squeaking on the freshly-waxed floor. Ponytailed girls, easy and laughing, stood in impenetrable clumps, adjusting their lip-gloss and eyeing the dance floor. Skinny boys sat on the bleachers like scattered islands. The prettiest girls were by the DJ. One had her sweaty t-shirt knotted up under her bra, showing off her perfect stomach as she danced.</p>
<p>I was trying to figure out where I belonged. Then Chris walked over and said hello. He had the biggest eyes I’d ever seen, and braces so big they could cause electrical fires. He bought me a can of Coke and handed it over as if it were a cocktail, or maybe a present. We dated for the next four years.</p>
<p>I was wild about him at first, but by the end he was more like a habit. We broke up for college, but eventually found each other again. We’d each moved back home after graduation, poor and frightened of the way the world was widening before us. We had to do terrible, grown-up things like get jobs and health insurance and figure out what a 401(k) was. We met up for commiserative beers at the Applebee’s near the Woodbridge Center Mall on happy hour Tuesdays. Chris had a plan for everything. He’d make millions on Wall Street, he said, play the markets, then buy one of those old Victorians in South Orange, the kind with a wraparound porch and an easy commute on the Dover line. He’d have two kids, maybe three. Play 18 holes down at the Bridgewater course every Saturday. It all sounded dull even then. But his shoulders were broad under his button-down, and his eyes were still warm. He felt like an unfamiliar man instead of the boy I’d once loved, a complicated blend of strange and familiar.</p>
<p>I didn’t know what I wanted. A job in marketing, maybe. After four years of diner waitressing for spare cash a clean white cubicle sounded like something worth having.</p>
<p>One night that October we went to a midnight showing of <em>The Shining</em> in Maplewood. The theater was small, family-owned. They made real popcorn and they used real butter. Chris liked the enormous Loews’s on Route 22, with the reclining leather seats and bar service, but this rickety place was my favorite. I loved horror movies, especially old classics. I adored the way they made my palms prickle, how alert they made me feel, how alive. I clung to Chris’s arm that night during the scary parts, not really aware I was doing it. The credits came up but it was still dark, and all of a sudden he was kissing me for the first time in four years. And while it wasn’t the most amazing thing I’d ever felt, at least it felt like something.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>These days, when I run, I notice men noticing me. I go longer and longer, sometimes in the evening along the waterfront in Jersey City, where we live. I run six miles from my neighborhood down along the Hudson. I stand on the pier looking at the city lights across the river, feeling the flush on my cheeks, my sweat drying in the cool salt-breeze. I take down my hair to let the roots dry. I slip out of my jacket even though it’s cold and let the wind wick my shoulders dry.</p>
<p>It’s new, the men. Sometimes they stop in their tracks and stare. I’m not sure what’s different. It’s my body, sure, but it feels like more than that. I try not to look back, and this makes them look harder. It feels like power maybe, sexual power, and it makes me think of Jessica every time. I wonder how she had access to a well like this when she was so young. How much power I probably had back then too, though I didn’t know it. Sometimes a wave of anger crashes over me for figuring this out on the wrong side of 30.</p>
<p>The running helps. There’s an edge to me when I run, a hard angry something I don’t understand. It burns behind me like a torch.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Jessica’s been married to Steve for three years now, but she cheats whenever she wants. The thing is, she’s honest about who she is. If you ever dated Jessica, if you fucked her, or god forbid you married her, you knew you were in for trouble. That’s why they flocked to her like honeybees, dancing around her gorgeous, tattooed body. As a teenager I hung out in my bedroom most of the time. I read a lot of books. I was the one afraid of roller coasters, of sneaking out, of our parents’ disappointment, of getting pregnant. Jessica laughed at me, but not unkindly. She loved me the way you love an old dog—affectionately, out of habit—but mostly she ignored me. I wanted to ignore her right back, but you can’t unsee a girl like that. She was the brightest thing in every room.</p>
<p>I had a panic attack the day I married Chris, although I didn’t recognize it as such until years later. When I couldn’t catch my breath, I thought the corset lacing of my wedding dress was too tight.</p>
<p>“Get it off,” I pleaded. Tears rose in my eyes, which had been made up by professionals for $125. My bridesmaids undid my dress, kind of cooing and fluttering, and I drew in great gasping breaths. I sat on the edge of my childhood bed and dug the heels of my palms into my eyes.</p>
<p>Jessica knelt in front of me. She’d dragged over a small rotating fan and aimed it at my face. She blotted my tears with a folded over Kleenex.</p>
<p>“You can bust out of here, you know,” she whispered under the whirring. The fan was six inches from my face, blowing back my carefully arranged curls. “I’ll take care of everything.”</p>
<p>I stared at her. The other girls couldn’t hear. She put her hand on my knee and waited. Her hair was plaited over her ears, like a farm girl but somehow sexy, always so sexy.</p>
<p>“That’s ridiculous.” I sat up straight, my fingers fiddling with my dress beading. “I just couldn’t catch my breath. I’m fine.”</p>
<p>She knelt back onto her heels. She stared at me, tilting her head to the side.</p>
<p>“Whatever you say.” She snapped to her feet, dropped the fan onto the corner table, then sauntered away and left me there, staring out the window. A leaden heaviness fell over me like wet snow.</p>
<p>That night Chris and I lay down in the honeymoon suite holding hands, exhausted and sexless. He fell asleep right away, tuxedo still on, black tie unknotted and draped over his shoulder. I went to the mirror. My hair was unraveling from its rhinestone pins. I winced at the swollen welts under my arms where beadwork had rubbed my skin raw. I took a bath in the oversized tub, feeling tiny, sort of dreamy. The rose petals left grease marks on the ceramic edge. I could hear my friends by the campfire behind the hotel. They were shouting and laughing. A dull beat of music pulsed in the background.</p>
<p>I knew Jessica was at the other end of the paisley-carpeted hallway. She told me later that she fucked the bartender. I imagined her blue silk dress, the one I’d picked out, hiked to her waist. The pair of them holding each other’s faces, forehead to forehead. Laughing while he lifted her over the radiator, pushed her against the wall.</p>
<p>At sunrise, Chris smiled over the wrinkled petals on the bathroom tiles. He kissed the wounds under my arms and brought me fresh coffee. I played with my favorite cowlick in his hair. We had sex and it was as good as ever, pretty good, and afterwards, feeling warm and sleepy against his chest, I finally fell asleep.</p>
<p>But later, while he showered, I walked alone through the deserted hotel grounds. I sat on a log by the damp campfire. Shards of glass were mixed into the dirt. Broken beer bottles glinted under stray beams of sunlight breaking through the morning haze. I felt like I’d missed the party, even though the party had been mine.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“But why? Why do it?” I pressed Jessica. We were at the Menlo Park Diner like every Sunday. Chris spent Sundays at the office lately. “Getting a jump on things,” he’d said that morning, kissing me on the forehead in bed. The apartment door slammed shut and I clutched Turnip closer. The squirrel that lived in the old flowerpot on the fire escape was having his breakfast. We watched him together.</p>
<p>“Does there have to be some mystery reason?” she said. “I want to. So I do it. Not everything has to mean something.” She sipped a cherry Coke through a straw, then put more butter on her pancakes.</p>
<p>“Jesus. You’re 30 years old and you eat like a child.” She was so fucking vivid. It was excruciating. I leaned low over my plate. “No one made you marry him. Why don’t you just leave?”</p>
<p>Her eyes widened. She put down her fork. “Why would I do that?” she said. “Its just sex, Taylor. So what?”</p>
<p>“So what? Don’t you think it would hurt him?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I do,” she said flatly. “And that’s why he won’t find out.” Cars were streaking by on Route One, traffic upon traffic, red taillights blazing through window steam. She sighed. “Everyone does this, Taylor. It’s just no one talks about it.”</p>
<p>“Not everyone cheats,” I said. My hands were shaking under the table. “But tell yourself that if it makes you feel better.”</p>
<p>“Oh, honey.” She looked at me. “Just because you’re miserable doesn’t mean I have to be.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>I packed for my business trip on a Tuesday night. Chris was watching CNN in the living room. Turnip watched me, her tail beating out a sad song on the blue knit blanket she snoozes on. I packed the normal things. Business clothes. Running shoes. Hair gel, deodorant. I lingered over my underwear drawer. There was a bra in the back I hadn’t worn since my early 20s. Black lace, sheer. I’d felt sexy in it then, when sex was something new and we did it whenever we could.</p>
<p>I laid it on the bed. It looked sort of hopeful—black lace ages so gracefully, I thought. I found the black thong that had upset Chris the week before. I laid them together, the way I would if I worked at Bloomingdales: carefully, prettily. I thought about Jessica’s underwear drawer. Feathers came to mind.</p>
<p>I peeked out. Chris had fallen asleep on the couch, an issue of <em>Forbes</em> on his chest. I closed the door and paused. Then I took off my clothes. I slipped into the old bra, the lacy underwear. I took down my hair. I put on lipstick, red again. I grabbed a pair of heels from the back of my closet—ruby colored, sleek, and I slipped them on. I’d bought them years ago on clearance at DSW, but I hadn’t worn them in public once. I stood before the mirror, all dark curls and pale breasts, black lace and gleaming red. I stared for a long time, considering. Then I took everything off and, still naked, hair falling down on my shoulders, I packed the underwear and heels in my suitcase.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“Hey there, sailor girl,” Paul said when I walked into the ballroom. Taylor the sailor, he’d coined me a few months ago. We’d stayed up late after another conference. We drank martinis at the hotel bar and he gave me all of his olives. I’d gotten drunk and confessed I’d never been on a boat in my life. He teased and teased—not because he gave a shit, just to make me laugh. He sat too close on his barstool, his arm brushing against mine. When he walked me to my room he rested his hand at the base of my back, guiding me, or maybe claiming something, but I slipped away. I went to bed alone, flustered, my body aching. I snuck out the next morning before breakfast. I hadn’t seen him since.</p>
<p>We both worked for Marriott International. I was in management; he was a sound engineer, always in the background setting up microphones, fiddling with lights. He wore all black, casual stuff, jeans and t-shirts. He would have seemed too serious without that smile. He was about ten years older than me: just enough to make it interesting. His eyes were so dark they were almost black, but there was laughter at the back of them. He felt familiar. Like someone I’d known since I was old enough to know anything, although I didn’t understand why.</p>
<p>I flushed when I saw him. The plan had been to keep a clear head. I was decidedly not wearing the red heels. I felt his eyes on me as the conference went on. When I caught him staring he looked back evenly. The room fell away as I stared back.</p>
<p>I wasn’t used to any of this. I felt like I’d been married my whole life.</p>
<p>“I know what that ass looks like bent over a pool table,” Chris had said a few weeks earlier. I’d told him how we’d all ended up playing pool at the hotel bar. “You better watch yourself.”</p>
<p>I didn’t know if I was flattered or angry when he talked like that. Lately it felt like he was trying to drown me, or maybe I was trying to run and he could feel me slipping.</p>
<p>Paul was still watching me across the room. I wondered what Jessica would do.</p>
<p><em>I’d bang him</em>, <em>that’s what I’d do,</em> I imagined her saying. She’d be sitting at the bar next to me, on her third Manhattan but still cool somehow. Her toned legs would be crossed, her eyes scanning the room for someone better to talk to. <em>I mean; Jesus, your vagina is growing cobwebs. Are you ever going to do something worth remembering? </em></p>
<p>When she’s mad, like real mad, which is often, she throws things. Books, glasses, whatever she can get her hands on. She’ll throw them across the room, punch walls, kick garbage cans and scream.</p>
<p>“You’ve got the devil in you,” her husband said once, after she threw a stack of dinner plates one by one against the kitchen wall.</p>
<p>The only thing I’ve ever thrown was a bag of dirty gym clothes. Chris and I were walking home after dinner with friends. We’d had too much to drink, and we were fighting. He was two hours late to dinner and had shown up half-drunk. The company car dropped him at the restaurant and he sauntered in like he owned the place, like he didn’t smell like scotch, like our friends weren’t whispering behind our backs. Later he was holding my phone to take a picture when an old friend, a guy, texted to say hey. Chris read the text and threw the phone down on the table like it disgusted him. Like I disgusted him. Like holding something that belonged to me had burned his hand. I’d never cheated on anyone in my life, but that didn’t seem to matter. We walked home screaming under the streetlights, past stately brownstones that had been there for generations. They had seen worse than us.</p>
<p>He walked away while I was still crying. I wanted to throw something but all I had was that bag. I threw it as hard as I could at his retreating back—to hurt him, to get his attention, anything—but I missed. It hit a garage door, just soft-lobbed right onto nothing in unsatisfying slow motion, like trying to hit something in a dream. My sneakers and dirty socks spilled onto the driveway in a pathetic heap. He didn’t come back for me. Drained and ancient, I knelt for a minute on the cold asphalt to look at the black sky.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Jessica and I used to go to Six Flags during college. We wore short shorts and bright tank tops. We ate cotton candy and rode the log flume. She sunburned, I freckled. She went on the roller coasters. I sat on a bench, thighs sticking to the hot plastic, and held her purse on my sweating lap. One time her new boyfriend was supposed to meet us but he never showed. She checked her phone for hours. The more she panicked, the wilder she became. She spoke faster, louder, barked laughter. She flirted with the boys waiting in line around us in a hard, almost hysterical way. Then she went on a ride called Free Fall for the first time. In the past she’d strode right by it. “Crazy bitches,” she’d say, shaking her head. But that day she climbed into the open-walled elevator that took her up, skyscraper-high, way out of reach, her white-blond hair a gleam against the hot August sky. Teenagers with floppy hair and acne strapped her into a thick leather harness as if she were jumping out of a plane. She stood on the platform in bare feet. I imagined her cherry-painted toes curled over the edge. She raised her arms like wings, then paused. Her phone was cradled in my hand. He still hadn’t called. She dove, arcing down into the sky like a plunging bird. Her mouth open but silent.</p>
<p>When she landed in the netting, her hair was matted to the tear-tracks on her cheeks. “That wind,” she laughed, shaking out of her harness. I smiled and handed over the phone. She tucked it into her back pocket and left it there.</p>
<p>She had been pregnant that day, and she’d known it. So did the vanished boyfriend. I found her in bed one afternoon a week later, ragged from weeping, clutching her stomach after the abortion. I climbed into bed and curled up behind her in my jeans. I loved her so much I wanted to swallow her. Her shoulders were light, sparrow’s bones against my chest. I brushed her hair back from her forehead and hushed her over and over. <em>Baby girl,</em> I said. <em>Baby girl.</em> She hadn’t let me touch her like that in years. She never would again.</p>
<p>There is a grace to ending things the right way. She and I were born without it.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Paul offered to walk me to my room. I accepted. We ducked out a side door and cut across the dark lawn. It was late, maybe 2 a.m. I was a little drunk, but not enough to blame it on that later. The grass was damp beneath my feet. The June night was humid and sweet, with crickets sawing away. It was only suburban Connecticut but I felt far from home, sort of placeless. The stars were trying to come out. I took off my beige pumps and dangled them from my fingertips. I buried my feet deeper into the wet grass with each step, aiming for soft mud below. The mud-caked heels streaked against my white suit pants. I felt fond of the stains, all of a sudden.</p>
<p>“Want to sit?” Paul asked. We’d come across a park bench under an oak tree in the middle of the lawn.</p>
<p>Knowing better, I said yes. Knowing better, I sat close. He started telling stories, jokes about nights on the road, conferences gone wrong. We knew the same people in the same cities, all so boring and one-toned and hopeless. He had a friendly, open smile, but I felt tight energy whirring under his skin, something calculating and careful, and I liked it.</p>
<p>I relaxed into him. I wondered when the guilt would come. It didn’t show up when he put his hand on my thigh for a few beats and my whole body lit up. Not when he rested his palm on my lower back when I leaned over to put my shoes down. Not when I laughingly touched his arm during the funny part of one of his stories, surprising myself by the instinct for touch. My mind drifted, for a moment, toward Chris. Maybe Turnip was asleep on his lap. More likely she was alone, curled up on her pillow while he worked late again. Staring out the window into the night, patiently waiting, devotion for him thrumming through her.</p>
<p>Paul’s wedding ring glinted under the pale streetlight. I was always surprised to see it there, so stubborn and silver. He never mentioned a wife. He gave off a road-warrior air, a dusty traveler, a loner. I wondered if she was my age. If she were more beautiful than I was. I cared more about his ring than my own, I realized. I tucked my left hand under my thigh.</p>
<p>When he kissed me, finally, finally, I was still waiting for the guilt that wasn’t coming. This is what Jessica meant, I thought. This is how she feels.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>I thought I’d only do it once. To know what it felt like to want something, and then actually take it. He seemed surprised at the ferocity in me, the way a park-bench kiss nearly turned into a fuck on the ground in the dark. I might have scared him. But then again, what do I know? He might have been thinking he hit pay dirt, that here was a hot little number, a real slut, the kind of girl who moans into the mouth of a man she doesn’t even know. Some sweet-smelling thing that dreams about sailboats, about roller coasters and running away. He might’ve headed home to his wife feeling sated for a while. More generous with his small talk as the chicken thawed on the kitchen counter. More patient when she bent over her sewing as he read a book on the couch. Stripped clean of need, for a moment. More able to love her.</p>
<p>That’s not what happened to me. I went home and found a stranger across my kitchen table. He was cardboard, a poster of a man I didn’t recognize and hadn’t loved in years. When he lay in bed, breathing evenly in the dark, I was grateful for Turnip between us, her warm body a shield. The need to get fucked, so desperate and new, pulsed out of me in waves my husband couldn’t feel or touch.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>In an effort to alleviate the growing pressure in my chest I do all kinds of things these days. I go for longer runs—eight miles, ten—punishing my legs and my lungs and my heart with the night wind that rushes across the river. Manhattan twinkles across the water like a savior, like something to dream about, but I’m too old to believe in all that anymore. Still, it steadies me. All that granite. The sea wind and the black river and the white lights.</p>
<p>When I told Jessica about Paul, she stared. Then she nodded, just once, and looked back at her menu. “Good for you,” she said.</p>
<p>That was it.</p>
<p>I don’t know what I’d expected—a gossip fest? Sisterly confidences? For her eyes to fill with surprise, maybe admiration?</p>
<p>I did not expect a dismissal.</p>
<p>I didn’t expect to start meeting Paul all the time either. All those anonymous hotel rooms, my blood so thick with desire there was simply no room for shame. I showered under the hottest water I could handle, scalding my skin, barely able to breathe in the steam. Jessica stopped meeting me for Sunday breakfast, but to be honest I barely noticed.</p>
<p>For a few months I had it all, I suppose: stability at home, passion on the road. I’d always judged people like that. Especially my sister. I didn’t understand how she could live with the guilt, look her husband in the eye, walk around with that horrible ease, like she deserved anything good at all.</p>
<p>It had never occurred to me that she didn’t feel guilty. Duplicity is easy, turns out. You just have to want something enough.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>A few months in, still dithering and distracted, my husband went ahead and ended our marriage for me. He went through my phone while I was in yet another too-long shower, steaming my pores and daydreaming. I came out wrapped in a towel, pink-skinned and humming. He was standing in the corner, between the radiator and the window. As far away from me as he could get. I was surprised at how biblical it was: the way I dropped to my knees.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>My new studio is a few blocks from our old place. I’ve got a double bed, an old-fashioned writing desk, and a stained glass lamp I picked up at a yard sale. Turnip’s bed is in the corner. I hide it in the closet when she’s staying with Chris, which is most of the time. The one who cheats doesn’t get to keep the dog.</p>
<p>I could’ve told Paul what happened to my marriage, but I didn’t. He called for a while, and if the worry in his voice and the memory of his hands made me falter, I toughened to it in time. I still think about his undershirts. I remember running my mouth along the edge where shirt ended and warm neck began. I picture him wearing one and a pair of boxers, shuffling around in his at-home life, with his at-home wife. When he pours himself a cup of coffee, does he bring her one too? Does he lean down and kiss her forehead at the kitchen table? Does she stroke his forearm in absentminded thanks? I picture a light-boned woman, a calmer one, less difficult, more beautiful, and have to turn my face from a black-hole quality of pain. The image of him walking around his own house, hair fussed from sleep, feels stamped into my spine.</p>
<p>Maybe this is why Jessica picked a new man every time.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wake to unfamiliar shadows on blank walls and reach for Chris before I’m fully awake. The first time this happened I crawled around on his side of the bed, digging through cold sheets like a dog for a bone. I waited for dawn huddled in the corner, arms wrapped around my knees, seasick with shame. Disoriented by loss.</p>
<p>Other days though—most of them, if I’m honest—I wake in a patch of warm sunlight. I stretch in silence, often unclothed. I sit at my desk, I write, I drink coffee. There’s a quiet happiness to these mornings, a peace so deep it’s almost joy, and I’m ashamed I didn’t reach for it sooner.</p>
<p>In a fit of optimism on move-in day I bought three bottles of champagne. I imagined Jessica visiting some Saturday night. We’d order Chinese takeout and she’d bring Ben &amp; Jerry’s. We’d sit on the floor leaning against my new mattress. I’d tell her my secrets and she’d teach me what happens next. She hasn’t been answering my texts, but I’m thinking she’ll come around any day now. The bottles look hopeful, covered in icy sweat in the back of the fridge. When the door swings shut they clink and chime like little bells.</p>
<p>I still wish for sex. There’s no one in the living room with his own morning coffee. No one to walk up behind naked, to kiss on the neck, to lead, smiling, toward a marital bed. There’s no living room here, and certainly no marital bed. Just four yellow walls, my books and my lamp. A handful of daisies in a cracked water glass on the windowsill. I replace them every day. They feel like a prayer.</p>
<p>I spend whole weekends in my underwear, reading and taking naps. I write poetry right onto my bedroom walls, then paint over it as many times as I like, in whatever colors I want.</p>
<p>Occasionally I feel the weight of that first hot kiss, that wet night. For opening a door I never planned to open, and couldn’t close again. I go on those waterfront runs, so long, so punishing, and when men turn and stare these days I stare right back, and even I don’t know if my gaze is a challenge or an invitation. I return to my apartment shaking, drenched, giddy with endorphins and my imaginary cleanliness. If Turnip’s there she’s on the bed, waiting for me. I let her lick the sweat off my neck and chest. I rock her against me, feeling strong and free, and I realize I’m laughing. I’m actually laughing.</p>
<p>So what, is what I’m thinking. So what?</p>
